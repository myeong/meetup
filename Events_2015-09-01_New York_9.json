The final result has the feel of a scary supernatural take on Hitchcock's Rebecca. Tomb succeeds on a variety of levels including Robert Towne's excellent script, the use of widescreen photography, fantastic sets and locations that add to the scary atmosphere, and a great performance by Vincent Price. Here, Price plays a brooding widower (with a curious eye malady) whose obsession with his late wife takes a terrifying turn for the worse once he takes a new wife. Elizabeth Shepherd is also good as the frightened, but curious, bride who finds herself stalked by one of the nastiest cats in cinema history. In one excellent sequence, the evil black feline lures Shepherd deep into the maze-like catacombs of their abbey home while Price's voice-over reveals details about his late wife, Ligeia.

Round eleven takes us to the legendary Spa-Francorchamps circuit,\u00a0one of the F1 calendar\u2019s true classics and one of its toughest tests.<\/p> <p><b>THE TRACK -<\/b>\u00a0At 4.35 miles in length, it is the longest on the F1 calendar with iconic corners such as Eau Rouge that tests cars and drivers to the limit.\u00a0Spa-Francorchamps\u00a0is one of the season\u2019s fastest tracks with average speeds of 230km\/h and the stretch from the exit of La Source to Les Combes sees the throttle wide open for the longest single period on the calendar. Finding the right balance between low down force for the high-speed first &amp; third sectors and good grip for the twistier middle sector will pose a tricky challenge with the set-up for the teams.<\/p> <p><b>STANDINGS -<\/b>\u00a0Lewis Hamilton leads the Driver's Championship with 202 points followed by his teammate Nico Rosberg with 181 points. Sebastian Vettel has closed the gap to the Mercedes drivers after the win in Hungary.\u00a0Vettel trails Rosberg by 21 points. In the Constructor's Championship, Mercedes still holds a commanding lead of 383 points with Ferrari in 2nd with 236 points and Williams in 3rd with 151 points.<\/p> <p><b>TYRE ALLOCATION<\/b>\u00a0<b>-<\/b> As in Hungary, Pirelli will be bringing the\u00a0P Zero White medium and Yellow soft tires.\u00a0Pirelli expects\u00a0a performance gap of 1.8 \u2013 2.0\u00a0 seconds per lap\u00a0between the two compounds.<\/p> <p><b>TALKING POINTS - <\/b>Will the new start rules result in changes to the competitive order on the opening laps of race? Can Hamilton bounce from a disastrous race in Hungary with a win at Spa? Will this be the race where Raikkonen win the first race of the season?\u00a0Can Rosberg take the chequered flag in Spa and reduce the gap in Drives Championship? If you're in the New York City area and looking for some great racing action with other F1 fans, be sure to join us for the Belgian Grand Prix to see who will take the checkered flag.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Race will start at\u00a0<b>08:00 AM EDT<\/b>\u00a0with the pre-race starting at\u00a0<b>07:30 AM EDT<\/b>.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p>We'll play 3 simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with goals. There will be 6 teams on the field and we will play three games, 30 minutes\/game. Every 30 minutes we will have a short break and teams will switch to play against different team. Please check your email or our meetup message board on friday night or before 12.00pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p>If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.<\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>Riverside Park\u00a0at West\u00a0107 &amp; 108 Street<\/p> <p>Take the 1 RED Line Train to Cathedral Pkwy an walk two blocks down,\u00a0to 108th Street and Riverside Dr.<\/p> <p>The field is down the lower level near the river.

Why do we even do some service to somebody? It is because it gives some happiness to us. So anything we do in our life is directed towards achieving happiness, greater happiness, and even greater happiness. That\u2019s how the mind goes. Yet, are we happy? Yes, some times. But often not!<\/p> <p>This free seminar examines what comes in the way of our happiness. There will be a discussion on tools that can lead us to happiness \u2013 tools that every human being is privileged to learn and use. Come, relax, refresh and smile.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/212+Durham+Ave,+Metuchen,+NJ+08840\/@40.5423717,-74.3736997,17z\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c3b7dad3527f8f:0xcc9e04da25c6bd8a?hl=en","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/YogaMeditationNJ\/events\/224628251\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":5400000,"name":"An Introduction to The Happiness Program","id":"jmrsjlytlbfc","time":1440338400000,"updated":1440344859000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1210136242000,"name":"New Jersey Yoga and Meditation Group","group_lon":-74.3600006104,"id":1139076,"urlname":"YogaMeditationNJ","group_lat":40.5400009155,"who":"Yogi & Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07092","country":"us","city":"Mountainside","phone":"(908)527-4930","address_1":"1000 Springfield Ave","name":"Echo Lake Park","lon":-74.331744,"id":710468,"state":"NJ","lat":40.682073,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":18.540102005,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438966459000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>REGISTRATION NOW OPEN! <a href=\"http:\/\/tkgtn.com\/m9xwm\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/tkgtn.com\/m9xwm<\/a><\/p> <p>Tinkergarten\u00ae provides the best early childhood education in the healthiest classroom of all\u2014the outdoors.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

The south county trail begins in Van Cortland Park in the Bronx, and continue for 14.1 miles up to Elmsford NY, and the North County trail picks up from there and continues for another 36.2 miles (combination of North County and Putnam County trail) until Brewster NY. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>We will have three meeting locations that morning:<\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022<b>\u00a0First is W 79th St Boat Basin<\/b> along the Hudson River Greenway at <b>930 am<\/b> for anyone coming from Manhattan or Brooklyn and wants to ride from there (this add ~10 miles, 45 mins to the day).\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0From there we will continue north on the greenway bike path to the <b>second meet point at[masked] am, at the corner of Dyckman\/Broadway<\/b>, which is an easy location as the A train to Dyckman St is right there at that corner.\u00a0There is a nice coffee shop (park view, much better than the starbucks next door) and bike shop at the corner of Dyckman\/Broadway where we can grab a quick brew.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 \u00a0Then we will cross the broadway bridge into the bronx to <b>the\u00a0main meeting\/start point,\u00a0<\/b><b>at Van Cortland Park S\/Broadway at 1030 am<\/b> (you will see a big arch entrance).\u00a0<\/p> <p>I will post comments on the meetup page at each stop point when I arrive there to give other riders an update on my location. Also you can use an app called Glympse to get my location sent to your phone, which you can use at any point during the day. I will not wait more than 10 minutes at each of the start points. If you are late, please post a comment or text me and then attempt to catch up. Familiarize yourself with the route before you come.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The entire 50 miles takes about 4-6 hours, depending on pace and NOT counting the stop at the brewery. This trail is virtually flat the entire way, I believe the elevation loss\/gain is ~400 feet.\u00a0It is the most relaxing bike path I have done in the area, as it is nearly continuous with very few street crossings, few pedestrians, no cars, just you and a paved bike path through the woods! This will be a relaxing easy pace ride, not a race. There will be stops ~10-15 miles to take a break, grab a snack, etc.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>We will stop at the Captain Lawrence Brewery in Elmsford midway to \"hydrate\" and they have a wood fire pizza stand there for anyone wanting to have some lunch :)\u00a0<\/p> <p>At the end in Brewster, we will ride ~1 mile to the Metro North station to take the train back to NYC.\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nycbikemaps.com\/maps\/north-and-south-county-trailways-bike-map\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nycbikemaps.com\/maps\/north-and-south-county-trailways-bike-map\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.nycbikemaps.com\/maps\/north-and-south-county-trailways-bike-map\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>There is a small one mile section of road that has not been completed to connect the South and North County trail near Elmsford, it is a mile long on route 9A. This is where we will go to the Brewery actually so it works out perfectly.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Dont feel up for 50 miles? No worries, anyone can come along, you have several options. You can do just the South County trail up to the Brewery and then head back, which is ~15 miles each way, 30 miles total. That would be about 2-3 hours riding time depending on pace. One can also ride to several other towns along the trail and ride the Metro North back, from either Tarrytown (~20 miles riding) or Pleasantville (~25 miles) or Katonah (~40 miles). Or you can ride up to any point and turn back and head back to the start at Van Cortland Park. Familiarize yourself with the map to know where these bail out points are.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/4\/e\/600_287322062.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/a\/6\/4\/600_287331812.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>What to bring:<\/b> Must have own bike (road bike or hybrid\/touring bike preferable). Water (either water bottles on bike, or hydration pack), will pass a few locations with water fountains to refill water. Snacks (bars, trail mix, anything quick to eat) and\/or sandwich for more calories. Comfortable clothes to ride in, bike shorts are ideal for longer rides. If there is forecast for rain (&gt;30%) I will cancel.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Directions\/Logistics:<\/b> We will start at Van Cortland Park South, near Broadway, at intersection of Broadway and 242nd St\/Van Cortland Park South, \u00a0meet at 1030 am at the park entrance. \u00a0See above for other start point options. For public transportation take the 1 train to 238 St stop, 2nd to last stop (NOT the Van Cortland park stop). \u00a0Other options are the A train to the last stop in Manhattan and ride up Bway across the Bway bridge to Van Cortland Park. The 4 train seems close but requires going down stairs to cut through to Van Cortland Park.\u00a0You can also drive to Van Cortland Park (I-87 to Van Cortland Park exit) and park your car there, but its difficult to return to the car afterward from the Metro North.\u00a0We will then ride the Metro North back from the end of the trail at Brewster to Grand Central Terminal (~1.5 hour train ride). Metro North requires a bike permit to bring bikes on board, which can be purchased IN ADVANCE at Grand Central Terminal for only $5 for lifetime (If you do not buy in advance, they will charge you $10 on the train to bring the bike on board, for ONLY that one ride). You can buy the train tickets at the Brewster stop however the trains run every :17 of the hour on Saturdays, so the goal would be to finish by 4 pm if possible, depending on pace and stops.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Feel free to email or text me in case of any questions:<\/p> <p>[masked] \u00a0<\/p> <p>[masked]<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/4\/0\/6\/600_287330182.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adventure-Outlet\/events\/224432405\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Bike 50 miles from NYC to Brewster w\/ stop at a Brewery for lunch","id":"224432405","time":1440340200000,"updated":1440379558000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1357706438000,"name":"Adventure Outlet","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":6566782,"urlname":"Adventure-Outlet","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07302","country":"us","city":"Jersey City","address_1":"8th St. & West Hamilton Place","name":"Hamilton Park","lon":-74.046183,"id":1358811,"state":"NJ","lat":40.727016,"repinned":false},"headcount":7,"distance":3.34961938858,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1430659749000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We are back outside again for the Spring!

One of the names most often cited as someone people want to read is\u00a0Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Let's see if people are willing to cash that literary check by rounding out the lazy summer with a hefty 448 page Russian tome.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The two years before he wrote\u00a0<i>Crime and Punishment<\/i>\u00a0had been bad ones for Dostoyevsky. His wife and brother had died; the magazine he and his brother had started\u00a0collapsed under its load of debt; and he was threatened with debtor's prison. With an advance that he managed to wangle for an unwritten novel, he fled to Wiesbaden, hoping to win enough at the roulette table to get himself out of debt. Instead, he lost all his money; he had to pawn his clothes and beg friends for loans to pay his hotel bill and get back to Russia. One of his begging letters went to a magazine editor, asking for an advance on yet another unwritten novel \u2014 which he described as\u00a0<i>Crime and Punishment.<\/i>\u00a0One of the supreme masterpieces of world literature,\u00a0<i>Crime and Punishment\u00a0<\/i>catapulted Dostoyevsky to the forefront of Russian writers and into the ranks of the world's greatest novelists.<\/p> <p><i>Crime and Punishment<\/i>\u00a0focuses on the mental anguish and moral dilemmas\u00a0of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in St. Petersburg \u00a0who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker\u00a0or her cash. Raskolnikov argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a worthless vermin. He also commits this murder\u00a0to test his own hypothesis that some people are naturally capable of such things, and even\u00a0<i>have the right<\/i>\u00a0to do them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov justifies his actions by comparing himself with Napoleon Bonaparte, believing that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.<\/p> <p>It is often said that <i>Crime and Punishment <\/i>is a study of guilt, but this is not strictly accurate: Raskolnikov does not feel guilt, but he does feel terror and an extraordinary depth of alienation from the rest of humanity. The other characters in the novel, because they are seen through the distorted lens of Rodion's perception, are largely ciphers. Even though friends make their best efforts to help him, he is unable to accept their help. He is even unable to understand their feelings of love and sympathy.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As readers we are plunged into one man's delirium, a symbol for the incomprehension which might overtake us all if we looked closely enough at our fellow human beings. The novel is full of half-conversations; we are never certain whether Rodion fully understands anything that is said to him, and certainly the other characters, because they are kept away from his secret, rarely understand anything he says to them. Although written in 1866, <i>Crime and Punishment <\/i>stands as the great antecedent to the 20th-century literature of alienation represented in figures such as Camus and Beckett.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll meet in the northwest corner of the Sheep Meadow, by 67th Street and West Drive, near the big tree halfway between Mineral Springs and Tavern on the Green.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/224695299\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Morningside Park","id":"gjrzflytlbfc","time":1440345600000,"updated":1440359247000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":9,"headcount":7,"distance":6.75958156586,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439398858000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Whether you are visiting our beautiful city, coming from a lesson, or just have the day off...come on out and hit with us! We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Even worse, then other factors may come up such as racism or sexism or even perhaps it\u2019s who you know.\u00a0 While these factors can all sadly play a part in how others discriminate against their fellow humans, we are constantly told that this is the way the world is rather than that we should be enabled to achieve.<\/p> <p>We look around us and in the modern media and see those with lots of wealth who are not as talented as us yet they are extremely successful. \u00a0The truth seems to incorporate this main factor: your destiny is fated and you need to follow a certain path. \u00a0This is an agreement you made before coming to earth so there are certain experiences in life you will have to go through in order to learn and grow. But the specific area we are concerned with here is the spirit or spirits. \u00a0Like guardian angels we all have a spirit either working on our behalf or causing trouble in our lives. \u00a0These spirits are meant to coexist or live in perfect harmony with one another. \u00a0However, when one or maybe even two go amok then there is an imbalance and you experience what feels like bad luck or obstructions in your life.<\/p> <p>Since these spirits reside within and around us, they can manifest in many different ways.\u00a0 The key to your success in life is knowing how to communicate with them so that you always achieve a perfect balance. \u00a0Many in the New Age movement refer to these spirits as energies or chakras. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter what you call them though!\u00a0 The net result is the same. \u00a0They are either working for your success or against it. And if they are working out of harmony then you need to find out what they or it needs to get back into alignment with the whole.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/e\/7\/600_440850951.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Each spirit is assigned a place and function by God. \u00a0They are always with and around you, existing in the background and helping you along the way. \u00a0The problem is that we have been conditioned by society not to believe and trust in these spirits or energies and to ignore them entirely. \u00a0This leads to the spirits not getting the nurturing they need and need to give back. \u00a0When this happens they start to cause havoc in your life not as a means to do evil but to alert you to the fact that you need to do some emotional house cleaning! \u00a0Meaning, the spirits need you to work with them and take care of them. \u00a0And you if take care of them they will take care of you.<\/p> <p><br\/>The end result will be health and wealth in your life if you build that relationship with them. \u00a0Remember, they are in your corner and ready to fight for you.\u00a0 The key is that you must learn how to communicate with them in order to achieve the success you\u2019ve always wanted in life.<\/p> <p>In this FREE session you will learn:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Which spirits are within you and which ones are you personally working with on a daily basis<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What the spirits names are<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What is your dominant spirit and why<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What is your weakest spirit and why<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How to communicate with your spirits to get them into balance<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How to ask for special favors<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How to send them out on secret missions for you<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Why they are out of balance and causing you trouble<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What is it that they need from you<\/p> <p>Register for your session now. \u00a0Spaces are limited. \u00a0This session will be dedicated to the Goddess Maat, Goddess of Truth and Balances. \u00a0Donations to her are welcomed but not obligatory!\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Project-Illuminated-Meetup\/events\/224600930\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"How To Communicate With Spirits","id":"224600930","time":1440352800000,"updated":1440376780000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1425788954000,"name":"Project Illuminated Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18485091,"urlname":"Project-Illuminated-Meetup","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Illuminated"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10310","country":"us","city":"Staten Island","phone":"10310","address_1":" 1000 Richmond Terrace ","name":"Snug Harbor Cultural Center","lon":-74.104643,"id":1081243,"state":"NY","lat":40.645282,"repinned":false},"headcount":10,"distance":9.42230606079,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432678517000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a shoot which will allow you to perfect your portrait technique in afternoon light.

J. Fikry, the irascible owner, is about to discover just what that truly means.<\/p> <p>A. J. Fikry's life is not at all what he expected it to be. His wife has died, his bookstore is experiencing the worst sales in its history, and now his prized possession, a rare collection of Poe poems, has been stolen. Slowly but surely, he is isolating himself from all the people of Alice Island-from Lambiase, the well-intentioned police officer who's always felt kindly toward Fikry; from Ismay, his sister-in-law who is hell-bent on saving him from his dreary self; from Amelia, the lovely and idealistic (if eccentric) Knightley Press sales rep who keeps on taking the ferry over to Alice Island, refusing to be deterred by A.J.'s bad attitude. Even the books in his store have stopped holding pleasure for him. These days, A.J. can only see them as a sign of a world that is changing too rapidly.<\/p> <p>And then a mysterious package appears at the bookstore. It's a small package, but large in weight. It's that unexpected arrival that gives A. J. Fikry the opportunity to make his life over, the ability to see everything anew. It doesn't take long for the locals to notice the change overcoming A.J.; or for that determined sales rep, Amelia, to see her curmudgeonly client in a new light; or for the wisdom of all those books to become again the lifeblood of A.J.'s world; or for everything to twist again into a version of his life that he didn't see coming. As surprising as it is moving, \"The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry\" is an unforgettable tale of transformation and second chances, an irresistible affirmation of why we read, and why we love.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-20-something-book-club\/events\/223848643\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"duration":7200000,"name":"\"The Storied Life of A.J.

France. Directed by Jean-Pierre Melville. Screenplay by Melville, from the novel by B\u00e9atrix Beck. With Jean-Paul Belmondo, Emmanuelle Riva, Nicole Mirel. In occupied France, the widow of a Communist resistant (Emmanuelle Riva), who has been forced to send her half-Jewish daughter into hiding, is further troubled by her powerful attraction to her female boss (Nicole Mirel) and her dying faith in God. Comfort comes in the unexpected form of a young Catholic priest (Jean-Paul Belmondo), whose attempts to rekindle the widow\u2019s faith stir other awakenings as well. Melville\u2019s film places two newly minted stars of the French New Wave in a spare, classical context, charged with suppressed eroticism. Riva, familiar to contemporary audiences for Michael Haneke\u2019s Amour, creates a strikingly complex character for a director not usually known for his characterizations of women. In French, English subtitles. 117 min.<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.moma.org\/visit\/calendar\/film_screenings\/24395\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.moma.org\/visit\/calendar\/film_screenings\/24395<\/a><br\/>-------------------------<br\/>Double feature week!<\/p> <p>I think this will be more interesting than the title suggests.

Manhattan. Sunday, August 23rd @ 2:30PM<\/p> <p>Gotham Yacht Club is looking for fun sailors and non-sailors to join us this weekend for a birthday celebration!<\/p> <p>We take trips around the Manhattan area in a 50-foot Beneteau. We usually sail the Hudson--the Statue of Liberty to the George Washington Bridge--but also go to Martha's Vineyard, the Hamptons and the Jersey Shore.<\/p> <p>We like to fill the boat up with about 20-30 people. No sailing experience is required, but preference is given to experienced sailors since the trips can\u2019t happen without them.\u00a0 As space is limited on the boat, simply RSVP\u2019ing \u201cYes\u201d to an event does not guarantee a spot on the boat.\u00a0 If a spot is available, you will be contacted directly with event details.<\/p> <p>Sailors can take their first trip to get acquainted and enjoy the party.\u00a0 From then on, sailors can choose to (1) work the morning shift and help out with the launch or (2) work the evening shift and help out with the return.\u00a0 Generally, sailors spend less than a third of the trip working and can take the rest of the time to relax and socialize.<\/p> <p>The current crew is made up of young, educated Manhattan professionals. We are looking to meet new people who will enjoy the atmosphere and company of everyone on the boat.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you and\/or your friends are interested, please copy, paste, and fill out the questionnaire below in an email and send to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>. Please include your current email address so that we can contact you directly.\u00a0 Since boat trips fill up in advance and we receive many applicants, we may not get back to you immediately. \u00a0<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you on the water!<\/p> <p>EVERY APPLICANT (REVELERS, SUNBATHERS, ETC.)<\/p> <p>Q) Please provide a link to your page on Facebook or other social networking site.

They generally last all afternoon into the early evening.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Q: Do I have to fill out the questionnaire?<\/p> <p><br\/>A: Yes! Please fill out the questionnaire as thoroughly as possible.\u00a0 If you are uncomfortable posting any of the information on your profile, please email your responses to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>.\u00a0 Without a complete application, you will not be considered to receive an invitation.\u00a0 The trips last several hours, so we will have 20-30 people in a confined space for an extended period of time. Therefore, we need to have an idea of who we are inviting on the boat and ensure that we have a proper crew.\u00a0 Please fill out the questionnaire if you are interested in sailing with Gotham Yacht Club.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Gotham-Yacht-Club-Social-Sail\/events\/224720417\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Sunday Sailing Birthday Party!","id":"224720417","time":1440354600000,"updated":1440366802000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1434554860000,"name":"Gotham Yacht Club: Social Sail","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18679654,"urlname":"Gotham-Yacht-Club-Social-Sail","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Sailors"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":5.53888320923,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1408326503000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>If there's no one at the ball fields, check the Long Meadow or the Nether Meade<\/p> <p>Here is a map with the location marked:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/464810\/PP-Map-letter-size.pdf\">&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/464810\/PP-Map-letter-size.pdf\"&gt;<a href=\"http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/464810\/PP-Map-letter-size.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/464810\/PP-Map-letter-size.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>and a map from the parks office:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.prospectpark.org\/visit\/interactive_map\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.prospectpark.org\/visit\/interactive_map\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.prospectpark.org\/visit\/interactive_map<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>If you have any questions, or comments or Songs of Praise for your lazy leader, feel free to email me (tim)<\/p> <p>BEGINNERS WELCOME! if you're new, haven't played in a while, forgot how to play, don't play that much, or just don't care about being ultra-competitive, now is definitely the time to come out and play.

We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

We like to think of it as a kind of spiritual singalong, and who doesn't like a singalong? We use several easy-to-learn and different Sanskrit texts and leave it to members to choose a chant they'd like the group to use on a particular evening. If you have never chanted before, come along and try out this wonderful spiritual tool. It doesn't matter if it seems strange to you--the point is precisely to buck oneself out of a sense of 'ordinary' life--or if you think you are completely atonal. You will probably derive a lot of benefit from doing chant, and it can lastingly help you forward in life.<\/p> <p>After the chanting ends, we immediately go into silent meditation for 20-25 minutes. Whereas chant tends to focus and energize the body and mind, silent meditation tends to quiet and calm the mind. It's a perfect counterpoint to the chanting.<\/p> <p>As you can see, then, the Sunday evening meetings are a kind of dual spiritual exercise: of energizing and focusing the mind (chant) and then relaxing and calming it (meditation).<\/p> <p>Come along to this or our other meetings if you feel you'd like to live a happier, calmer life and be able to live fearlessly through the cares and worries of modern life. If you can find a way to slow down and live more mindfully, you are well on the way to being an agent of joy and serenity in your own life and the lives of those living around you.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"1 or A trains to 190th Street","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Heights-Meditation-Washington-Heights-NY\/events\/224651436\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":2700000,"name":"Meditate Together Sunday Evenings","id":"rcdzjlytlbfc","time":1440370800000,"updated":1440376161000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1338897183000,"name":"Heights Meditation in Northern Manhattan","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4008442,"urlname":"Heights-Meditation-Washington-Heights-NY","group_lat":40.8499984741,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"236 W 78th St. (just off Broadway)","name":"Stand UP NY","lon":-73.980186,"id":22459132,"state":"NY","lat":40.782787,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.32745671272,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439948105000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a special Meetup, we finally got a deal with Stand Up New York the hottest club in New York City to let us in free of charge and see comics like Amy Shumer, Godfrey, Kevin Brennan and top names, this is NOT an amateur show of any kind.

People are encouraged to share experiences &amp; ideas, network or take off as they like. Feel free to keep writing if you've got the momentum going! Be aware Argo closes at 10pm.<br\/>If you're spending too much time THINKING about writing, come and join us for a session of focused writing. It may just be \"pipe-cleaning\" for now, but you'll feel better showing up at the page.

If you come late, we might have already started.<br\/>The music and occasionally nonmember conversation can be loud, so bring headphones too.<br\/>WiFi is available with purchase.<br\/>It's a little chilly, so if you get cold bring a sweater.<br\/>And it goes without saying that buying a cup of joe or a snack from Argo for being nice enough to host us will bring you good writing karma.<br\/>If you aren't sure you can make it, please don't RSVP! Come on time or even a little early, as it can be difficult to save seats.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/shutupandwriteNYC\/events\/224630902\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":3600000,"name":"NYC Shut Up & Write Meetup! - Columbus Circle","id":"cxklflytlbfc","time":1440374400000,"updated":1440381849000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1284414674000,"name":"Shut Up & Write!

He received an excellent education and a fine upbringing. From a very early age, he underwent mystical experiences which already indicated his exceptional destiny. For several years, he was the president of the New York Institute for Psychical Research, and was considered an authority in this field. In 1909, he made contact with the European leaders of the Rosicrucian Order. Having given proof of his integrity and of his knowledge in philosophical and esoteric matters, he was initiated in Toulouse, where he officially received the mission of reactivating the Order in America. Despite encountering numerous obstacles and difficulties, he carried out his mission well, and in conformity with the instructions that were given him by the Rosicrucians of France, he began to put into writing the Rosicrucian teachings. In order to demonstrate the traditional and authentic foundations of the Order, he made it known under the name, \"The Ancient and Mystical Order of the Rose Cross.\" In 1915 he was named Imperator, that is, the international leader. After having dedicated his entire life to the service of the Order, Harvey Spencer Lewis passed through transition on August 2, 1939.<\/p> <p>This work, which is dedicated to him, is presented so that you can discover his thoughts through his essays. Though written in the past century, their message is always fresh. They demonstrate the modern spirit and avant-garde nature of this great philosopher and humanist.<\/p> <p><b>All are Welcome!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/224382968\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Circle of Spiritual Inquiry - Master of the Rose Cross: Self-Healing","id":"fpbtflytlbgc","time":1440455400000,"updated":1440468090000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"off West 19th Street","name":"Coney Island Beach","lon":-73.986282,"id":23850041,"state":"NY","lat":40.578819,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.8532476425,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1436762103000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>CONEY ISLAND BEACH YOGA by donation <\/b>(suggested donation $10)<\/p> <p><b>MONDAYS<\/b>, weather permitting<br\/><b>7:00-8:00 pm\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Come join me as we practice yoga to the sound of the waves!

I think this method is good for fiction, screenplays, short stories and may even be useful for memoir and poetry.<\/p> <p>You'll find the Snowflake Method here: <a href=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/JWK\/nano\/The_Snowflake_Method.pdf\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/JWK\/nano\/The_Snowflake_Method.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/JWK\/nano\/The_Snowflake_Method.pdf<\/a><\/a>. It was created by the author who wrote Fiction Writing for Dummies.<\/p> <p><br\/>The Snowflake Method is based on the premise that you can \"design\" your entire story from a single sentence (Step 1). The PDF has many examples of one-sentence descriptions of novels you've heard of. The New York Times bestsellers list is a good source of one-sentence descriptions of novels.<\/p> <p>Step 2 is to write a five-sentence paragraph based on Step 1. The first sentence sets up the story. The 5th sentence says how the story ends. Each of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th sentences describes a \"disaster\" (or, as I prefer to think of it in less hyperbolic terms, a setback or challenge or obstacle) that your main character(s) go through in the process of the story.<\/p> <p>At this meeting, we'll be looking at sample Steps 1 and 2 for famous novels. Again, the PDF has many examples, from The Da Vinci Code to Jane Austen novels. Then we'll spend some time at this meet up trying to write our own Steps 1 and 2. If this goes well, in subsequent meet ups, we'll go through the remaining steps. (Step 3, for example, involves expanding each of the five sentences in Step 2 to a paragraph each.) All of the steps are detailed in the PDF.<\/p> <p>See you there!\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/JustWrite\/events\/224554927\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Let's get together and start writing!","id":"224554927","time":1440457200000,"updated":1440473992000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1221521095000,"name":"Just Write, NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1282993,"urlname":"JustWrite","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Just Writers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10019","country":"us","city":"New York","phone":"212 586-3400","address_1":"725 Tenth Avenue at 49th Street","name":"SKYLINE HOTEL","lon":-73.992248,"id":1018965,"state":"NY","lat":40.764065,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.980772972107,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439158132000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>You can have a stress-free, utterly successful, satisfying, and easy \u2013 that's right, easy \u2013 life.

The\u00a0Sue et Mare couch came from Karl Lagerfeld's collection, and a maze of other low-to-the-ground loungers such as a\u00a0kiss-shaped velour loveseat are similarly flamboyant. The skyline twinkles beyond floor-to-ceiling windows framed\u00a0by white curtains, but the scene is even more impressive on the massive roof deck where an endless array of wood\u00a0benches and sturdy garden chairs invite no less than 500 quitting-timers and night owls to take in unobstructed\u00a0views of the Empire State Building to the north, the Met Life building to the east, and Jersey to the west.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

Much higher level of meditation in group than I can achieve doing my own practice. I was very happy to find a meditation group that was focused on bringing together community members to practice meditation. Bodhi meditation is unique because they offer free sessions to the community. Nan is a wonderful teacher, and very compassionate person. You can sense that she has extensive experience in oriental medicine including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and energy healing,. Thank you Nan. \u201d Joe, Bodhi Meditation class Wednesday October 29, 2014\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"It's like looking into the eyes of Pure Love. I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for. Thank you, Lynn\" Bodhi Meditation Class Saturday March 14, 2014\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201c Very strong healing energy tonight. I got there feeling very tired. I had stomach pain all day, and during the first meditation of the evening it got a lot better. By the end I wasn't thinking about it at all. I left full of energy. \u201d Pam, Bodhi Meditation class November 22, 2013<\/p> <p>\u201c I didn't realize I would be reaping the benefits of Bodhi Med so quickly after attending only two classes. After my second class I felt even more relaxed. I have insomnia, but after the second session I fell asleep faster and deeper which has not happened for a long time. \u201d Dee, Bodhi Meditation class September 18, 2013<\/p> <p>It was enlightening!!! Every time I practice Bodhi meditation, it feels like my Chi increases more and more!

Last year, members of BNI (Business Networking International) passed millions of referrals that generated billions of dollars of business for each other. Belonging to BNI is like having dozens of salespeople representing your business, and in return you are representing their businesses. What goes around comes around. If I help you, you\u2019ll help me and we will both benefit as a result.<\/p> <p>The reason \u00a0BNI is so successful is that there is only one person per profession per chapter.

But as a quick primer, it's a game with rules similar to baseball -- except instead of using a bat to hit a little ball, you use your feet to kick a ball about 10x the size of a baseball. Kick the ball, run to the base, avoid getting your ball caught mid-air or yourself tagged out. Easy. And <b>no athletic skill is necessary<\/b>, just the ability to kick! Go out and practice now to get ready. Kick the postman when he delivers your bills. Kick that neighbor who won't turn down his stereo. Just get kicking!<\/p> <p>If you haven't played the game in 20 years, here are the general rules we will be using <a href=\"https:\/\/dl.dropboxusercontent.com\/u\/64476072\/Kickball%20Rules.pdf\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dl.dropboxusercontent.com\/u\/64476072\/Kickball%20Rules.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/dl.dropboxusercontent.com\/u\/64476072\/Kickball%20Rules.pdf<\/a><\/a>.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.neighborhoodsports.us\/Rules\/KickballRules\/tabid\/155\/Default.aspx\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/a><\/p> <p><b><i>A $3.00 organization fee will be collected at this event, your host is in the running for hardest working person on meetup.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><i><b>The important stuff ...<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0This is a co-ed game so ladies don't be shy to sign up.

Move over Siri, Cortana is the new star in town and with her comes an army of speech-enabled mobile &amp; desktop applications on Windows 10. Mobile applications are not always easy to work with due to the small screen and small on-screen keyboard. Using our voice is a natural form of communication amongst humans, and ever since 2001\u2019s HAL9000 and Star Trek, we\u2019ve been dreaming of computers who can converse with us like Tony Stark\u2019s J.A.R.V.I.S. Or maybe you\u2019re part of the new generation of Halo geeks dreaming of Cortana? Thanks to the new Windows 10 SDK for speech recognition and speech synthesis (aka text-to-speech), we are now several steps closer to this reality.<\/p> <p>This session explores the development techniques you can use to add speech recognition to your Windows 10 applications, including in-app commands, standard &amp; custom grammars, and voice commands usable outside of your app with Cortana. We\u2019ll also see how your apps can respond to the user via speech synthesis, opening-up a new world of hands-free scenarios, and explore new features in Windows 10 like background voice commands and continuous dictation.<\/p> <p>This reality is here, you\u2019ll see actual live Windows 10 phone &amp; desktop demos with speech and you can now learn how to do it. This session covers speech scenario on Windows 10 for Phone as well as Windows 10 apps running on tablets, laptops and desktops.<\/p> <p><b>ABOUT THE PRESENTER<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Nick Landry \u2013 Senior Technical Evangelist, Microsoft<\/b><\/p> <p>Nick Landry (<a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ActiveNick\">@ActiveNick<\/a>) is a mobility pioneer and former entrepreneur specializing in cross-platform mobile app development for Windows, iOS and Android devices.

She is also capable of imparting manyhelpful nuggets of information about the process of singing and performing\u00a0that one doesn't usually receive from one's teacher.\u00a0I found her instruction of enormous value.<\/i>___.\u00a0P.

I found the preliminary workshops\u00a0extremely helpful\u00a0in putting a role I'd worked on\u00a0(for longer than I'd like to say) into a historical, musical, and linguistic framework. I am eager to do more!\u00a0Anna Bartos is knowledgeable about a broad range of musical styles and genres, acting and character development as well as singing.\u00a0I would definitely like to perform in this type of event again.

Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside as a backup.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

Everyone interacts and works together to &lt;a&gt;create a story&lt;\/a&gt; and have a few laughs as well.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>New Rules for Signing Up:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>How to &lt;a&gt;sign up&lt;\/a&gt;: There will be at leas two &lt;a&gt;games running&lt;\/a&gt; each week.\u00a0 You will be able to see who is running, what games are being &lt;a&gt;played&lt;\/a&gt;, and who is &lt;a&gt;playing&lt;\/a&gt; below. There will be a total of six spots &lt;a&gt;open&lt;\/a&gt; in each game, so if a game has filled up you will not be able to join that game.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>When you &lt;a&gt;sign up&lt;\/a&gt;, leave a comment stating which game you would like to participate in and your name will be added to the roster. If you would like to leave a game or switch over to another game in &lt;a&gt;progress&lt;\/a&gt;, simply speak to Justin or Cat. They will let you know if there is &lt;a&gt;open&lt;\/a&gt; space to do so.<\/p> <p><br\/>If it is your first time &lt;a&gt;attending&lt;\/a&gt; a game, we have pre-made characters for you to &lt;a&gt;select&lt;\/a&gt; from.

We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't open our door from 6:30 - 7 pm while meditation is in progress. Kindly refrain from ringing our buzzer during this time.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/224435181\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjytlbhc","time":1440541800000,"updated":1440555328000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11237","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"135 Thames St.","name":"La Luz","lon":-73.927383,"id":12154822,"state":"NY","lat":40.70583,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.48819828033,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1431124038000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Tuesdays 6:30pm at La Luz $15 (1st class FREE!)<\/b><\/p> <p><b>For more info and schedule, to purchase class pass (also avail in person), visit: <\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.LaLuzNYC.com\">LaLuzNYC.com<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.LaLuzNYC.com\"><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/e\/a\/d\/600_437227853.jpeg\" \/><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Beginners will learn basic capoeira movements ranging from acrobatics and escapes to kicks and other aspects of self-defense.<br\/>While building a foundation of basics, you will learn how to put different movements together in combinations and sequences to play the game of capoeira.<\/b><\/p> <p>Taught by both Luz Emma and her son Adrian Miles!!<\/p> <p><i>Capoeira Mu\u00e7urumim\u2019s mission is to focus on the healing, martial, and dance aspects of Capoeira Angola and use Capoeira as a forum to bridge cultural gaps, combat community violence, promote self-empowerment, and healing. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.capoeiramucurumim.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.capoeiramucurumim.com\/<\/a><\/i><\/p> <p>WHAT IS CAPOEIRA ANGOLA:<br\/>Capoeira Angola is an Afro-Brazilian martial dance with origins in central and west Africa. It\u2019s roots lie in the N\u2019golo tradition in which two combatants, mimicking the movements of fighting zebras, would compete for the hand of a bride. The better warrior won the bride and was excused from paying a dowry. During the colonial era, this and other martial practices were up-rooted and transplanted to Brazil via the trans-Atlantic slave trade by the Portuguese. In Brazil, the art evolved with influences from different African tribes as well as from the indigenous culture of Brazil, and the effects of European colonialism. In Brazil, Capoeira was used as a means of liberation from societal and psychological constructs of slavery and colonial oppression. Capoeira Angola movements are offensive and defensive, and are primarily made up of kicks, sweeps, and escapes. The Capoeira ceremony takes place in a \u201croda,\u201d circle in Portuguese, and is accompanied by music and song indicative of African martial arts. From the late 1800\u2019s until the 1930\u2019s, Capoeira, along with other African traditions, was abolished and it\u2019s practitioners persecuted. Today, Capoeira is revered as the cultural treasure of Brazill.<\/p> <p>TEACHERS<br\/>Luz Emma Ca\u00f1as M.A., graduated with highest honors from the Chicano Studies Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara. She was a Graduate Fellow in the Department of World Arts and Cultures, U.C.L.A., while attaining her master's degree in Dance Movement Therapy and Rehabilitative Exercise. Extensively trained in classical ballet and modern dance, she has taught Pilates for over thirteen years. She was certified at Golden Bridge, Los Angeles, by the Kundalini Research Institute (KRI) in Kundalini Yoga and Meditation in 2003. She has studied Sufi Mysticism and Healing in the Shadhiliyya Sufi Path under the guidance of Sidi Shaykh Muhammad al-Jamal ar-Rifa\u2019i as-Shadhuli for over ten years and has been researching the healing aspects of Capoeira Angola. Luz has worked with a wide variety of clientele ranging from pre-verbal children to recording artists and super models. She has led workshops on the mind-body interface at Columbia University, Harlem Hospital and for American Airlines. Currently, she is giving continuity to the Capoeira passed down to her through her husband Mestre Jorge (may he rest is peace) through Capoeira Mu\u00e7urumim and also teaches Kundalini Yoga &amp; Meditation in Brooklyn.<\/p> <p>Adrian Miles, began training Capoeira Angola in Los Angeles in 2003.

The ideas expressed here will remove from your consciousness any fear of so-called death.<\/p> <p>Reincarnation is one of the world's most disputed doctrine. The belief in reincarnation has had millions of intelligent, learned, and tolerant followers throughout the ages. Ringing through the minds and hearts of students, mystics, and thinkers have always been the words: \"Why Are We Here?\" Reincarnation has been criticized by some as conflicting with sacred literature and as being without verification. This book reveals, however, in an intelligent manner the many facts to support reincarnation.<\/p> <p>Quotations from eminent authorities, and from Biblical\u00a0and Sacred works substantiate reincarnation.
