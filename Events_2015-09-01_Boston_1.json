August 9, 2015, 10:30 am\u20141 pm Join artist Wendy Jacob and the Boston Mycological Club for a mushroom hunt in the Sculpture Park. The event begins with a search of the grounds for mushrooms and other fungi at 10:30 am; participants reconvene at 12 pm to identify findings. Please bring a basket and a brown bag lunch. The Boston Mycological Club (BMC) is the oldest mycological club in North America. Every Sunday, from early July though late October, the club hosts mushroom forays in wooded areas throughout the greater Boston area. This program is free. Please tell the attendant at the Visitor Station that you are here for the Mushroom Foraging program; you will not be charged admission. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.decordova.org\/calendar\/mushroom-fora\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.decordova.org\/calendar\/mushroom-fora<\/a>...\u00ad<\/p>",

Those who have been in attendance will be put on an advanced track for the session.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nThis weeks session is vaulting, getting over obstacles quickly and effeciently.<\/p> <p><b>What if I've never done anything like Parkour before?\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>This class, Parkour 101, is a introductory level class. We will be focusing more on learning how to move our body, understand our limits and get a solid understanding of how to train safe rather than jumping straight into super-high level flips and jumps.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What if I'm a gymnast\/marine\/stuntman\/etc? I don't want to be bored.<\/b><\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement. It's very common to in the same class have one student working on perfecting their roll, and on the other side of the room have another student practicing very high-level acrobatics. They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/b><\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous. We accept cash or card day of.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Anything else?<\/b><\/p> <p>These jams will be run outdoors, and with existing architecture. While we won't be getting into anything crazy, injuries are to be expected. Scrapes happen. We will have first aid available, but make sure you are thinking clearly and in your limits before training!\u00a0<\/p> <p>I am available to answer all questions, but I hope to see a whole bunch of you out in a few weeks!!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Be sure to check us out on:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\"><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/7\/5\/600_437965461.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Our services have three parts: Healing Service, a Lecture on a spiritual topic, and Mediumship Spirit Communication. Each part lasts approximately 30 minutes.<\/p> <p>The Healing Service gives you the opportunity to receive healing energy that is channeled through one of our Healers. We believe that healing can be channeled through thought to those who need it. This is a very calming experience, whether or not you choose to sit in a healing chair.\u00a0 We encourage you to send healing to your loved ones, our communities, and Mother Earth.<\/p> <p>The Lecture covers a variety of topics ranging from the History of Spiritualism to Inspired Insights. It also includes examples of how Spiritualism is a part of our lives on a daily basis.<\/p> <p>Mediumship, or Spirit Communication, is the part of the service where a medium proves that \"...the existence and personal identity of the individual continue after the change called death.\" The medium might be a member of our church or visiting from another the Spiritualist church in the community. We also have mediums from abroad stop in often. While there is only enough time during a service for a few people to receive messages from their deceased loved ones on the Higher side Side of Life, everyone present benefits by witnessing proof of the continuation of life.<\/p> <p>At the conclusion of the service everyone is invited to our social hour downstairs for coffee and conversation.\ufeff<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>This is the regular meetup on Sundays at noon at Brooklyn Boulders in Somerville.\u00a0 Meet by the first table\/bench thing by the entrance.\u00a0 Hopefully we'll get a good variety of climbing interests coming so that everyone can follow their climbing passion!<\/p> <p>(Credit to Francesco Cardiello for the information below):<br\/>BKBS is the gorgeous, new, state-of-the-art climbing gym most convenient to those in the Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville area. Although pricier, it features 60+ feet toproping and lead climbing, a massive 22 x 140 foot bouldering wall (and there's still another upstairs), yoga &amp; fitness classes, a sauna, awesome water fountains that fill your water bottle, a retail store, lounge area, weight room, and a soon to open cafe! There's even a collaborative work space where you can study, work, and climb!<br\/>If you are looking for a partner or just want to get your climb on join us on Wednesdays for a fun time.<\/p> <p>FAQ:<\/p> <p>How do I get there? BKBS is conveniently located within a 10 minute walk of the Porter Square station. Walk down Somerville Avenue and turn right on Properzi way and head all the way down. It is also very bike accessible. If you drive, you can find the lot at 30 Dane St. It is located next to Artisans Asylum.<\/p> <p>Why should I do this meetup? Since BKBS is such a new community (opened in late July 2013) few people have developed regular climbing partners to train and climb with. This is a great opportunity to meet other climbers interested in BKBS. Climbing is an inherently social sport - to top rope and do lead, you need to meet people who are dedicated to climbing. The Wednesday meetup assures you'll meet a partner to regularly climb with. We are looking to expand to other nights in the future.<\/p> <p>What if I haven't climbed before? First off, don't be intimidated. Everyone started somewhere. If you have never belayed before, please make sure to take the Learn the Ropes class. More info can be found here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/<\/a>. If you have a working knowledge of how to belay, you will need to be belay certified before using the walls. Please flag down a BKBS employee and let them know you need to take a belay test. To pass such a test you will need to display how to tie a double figure eight knot with a fisherman's backup, safely belay a climber up a wall, catch them on a fall, and lower them to the ground safely.<\/p> <p>What equipment do I need? You will need at the bare minimum a harness and climbing shoes. Rentals are available. Grigri devices are provided at every station.<\/p> <p>What if I can come, but at a different time? Just let everyone know you want to climb at a different time and use the community to find a partner for those dates \/ times.<\/p> <p>These are the climbing rates:<\/p> <p>ADMISSION (Full day use, you can leave and come back!): Day Pass - $25 (Students $18)<br\/>10 Pack - $200 (Students $169)<\/p> <p>RENTALS: Shoes - $5<br\/>Harness - $5<br\/>Chalk Bag - $2<br\/>Full Gear Kit - $11<\/p>",

I'm moving in a few weeks, so I thought it would be fun to enjoy the deck with a party or two!<\/p> <p>There will be places to write inside (dining room table, coffee table, power strips) and a table\/umbrella on top if you're so inclined. Around 7:30 as the sun goes down, up top will turn into socializing, but feel free to write as long as you like inside or out. We can enjoy the sunset and then the city lights.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I'll have a couple bottles of wine, water, and some light snacks to share, but feel free to contribute snacks or beverages of your own.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/a\/0\/event_248404512.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>I'll send out a message the day before giving entry instructions to those who have RSVP'd 'yes'. \u00a0Street parking is sporadic in the area (though possible on South Street), but arriving by T (South Station) is by far the easiest and cheapest way to get here. There is also parking on top of South Station as well as in the Chinatown Garage, entering at 86 Beach Street.<\/p> <p><b>Special Note<\/b>: for those of you with allergies, we have a cat! She'll spend most of the evening in a bedroom, but I wanted to forewarn you.<\/p> <p><br\/>Happy Writing!<\/p> <p>Diane<\/p>",

Walk down Mass Ave towards MIT, make a right on Sidney Street, and walk down about four blocks to Pacific Street. It's about a 5-10 minute walk from the T stop.<\/p> <p>Parking: There are spots on one side of Tudor Street between Sidney and Brookline that are free to park at on weekends. It is the side of the street opposite the side with the parking meters.<\/p> <p>We have had a long waitlist the past few Sundays, so please make sure that you RSVP only if you can come, and show up on time if you have RSVP'ed. Due to high demand, we are putting in place a priority rule for those who show up consistently and on time. If there is a waitlist, no-shows from the previous week get lower priority. It counts as a no-show for waitlist purposes if you change your\u00a0RSVP to \"no\" less than 24 hours before the start time or arrive late for the actual game after warm-up.<\/p>",

Lifeguards leave and bathrooms close at 4:00, but there is a restaurant right on the beach where you could buy a drink and use their restroom. Beginners are welcome. We thought it would be fun to gather just the girls for a low stress and fun beach jam. Bring a beach chair and any fun music that you would like to share. There is no rain date.<\/p>",

Paul Revere park is right below the Charlestown Bridge. You can get there by T. Just go to north station and then walk behind the Garden to the Locks. There is a Walkway there. Or you can meet at Sorelle at 100 City Square for coffee. Walk through the\u00a0space between two buildings\u00a0and down the stairs. Make a right at the bottom of the stairs. Walk past the Residence inn on the left, Under the Charles town Bridge And you're there. People park on the street by the park. Even though it says no to, also people park in the residence inn parking lot. I do that alot. Also there is 2 hour on the street parking all over Charlestown. Good luck!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0<\/p>",

There's Tavern in the Square! If you're driving, you can park on the street for free on Sundays!<\/p> <p>Anyone who loves ASL is welcome to come and be part of the fun! We want to warmly extend an invitation to Deaf people or others fluent\/skilled in the language (CODAs for example) to join our group.<\/p> <p>This is an easy-going, casual, ASL get-together to meet people who enjoy American Sign Language, who want to brush up on their signing skills, and want to learn more ASL by using it as often as possible.<\/p> <p>We strive to have a good time and communicate without using voices. If we need to, we draw or write what we don't know how to sign, and if lots of folks show up, we split up into small groups and mix and mingle, so we can actually see one another clearly, face-to-face and get a good conversation going.<\/p> <p>Don't be afraid or shy if you're not \"perfect\" at ASL, because being \"perfect\" is not the point of this group. No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.<\/p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again. This isn't an ASL class, since none of us are certified ASL teachers, so there's really <i>no<\/i> pressure or expectation--other than that we all use ASL to communicate. We all learn from one another!<\/p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL\/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language<\/i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs<\/i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!<\/p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged<\/i><\/b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating. We have lots of resources that we can suggest for learning ASL from a qualified teacher or authentic source, such as books, online classes, and local classes at various locations near Boston.<\/p> <p>If you can, \"officially\" RSVP, even if the RSVP is \"No,\" so that we know who is definitely going to come.<\/p> <p>It will be great to see folks!<\/p> <p>Erika and Jack<\/p>",

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup. Therefore the number of RSVPs reflected here are NOT the total number of men or women registered.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

The theory is that his generals will loyally keep the peace and protect his heirs and other family members until they are old enough to take the reins of his vast empire, and CERTAINLY NOT try to carve off a mighty kingdom of their very own from some choice bits that just happen to be exactly where their loyal troops just happen to be standing.<\/p> <p>That's the theory. History teaches how well this theory usually works in practice.<\/p> <p>In Successors, you control two of those generals, and you have a choice: you can be a loyal champion of the late emperor's family and gain Legitimacy Points by protecting the young heirs and carrying Alexander's funeral cart from Babylon back to the Macedonian capital city, Pella, or you can stake out a position as a successor to Alexander's throne (by right of We Can Beat You Up) by gaining control of provinces and claiming Victory Points. You can win instantly by passing a VP or LP threshold, you can win by controlling one of the heirs at the start of the appropriate turn AND having the most VP and LP combined, or you can win at the end of five turns by having the most VP.<\/p> <p>To me, this sounds like Game of Thrones with fewer nude scenes but better hummous. Does it sound good to you? Let's play.<\/p> <p>We'll be meeting at Pandemonium for this one. It's two blocks from the Central Square Red Line stop. The Open Gaming begins at Pandemonium at 6 but I'd like to get there a little early (this hasn't historically been an issue, most of the time) to aid in teaching the game with enough time left over to play the thing, so please shoot for 5:30 if at all possible.<\/p>",

Separated by divorce from his father and brother, Toby and his mother are constantly on the move, yet they develop an extraordinarily close, almost telepathic relationship. As Toby fights for identity and self-respect against the unrelenting hostility of a new stepfather, his experiences are at once poignant and comical, and Wolff does a masterful job of re-creating the frustrations and cruelties of adolescence. His various schemes - running away to Alaska, forging checks, and stealing cars - lead eventually to an act of outrageous self-invention that releases him into a new world of possibility.<\/p>",

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup.

However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup. Therefore the number of RSVPs reflected here are NOT the total number of men or women registered.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups. Please note that many people opt NOT to RSVP through Meetup for privacy reasons.<\/i><\/b><\/p>",

It's at a great time, the people are friendly, the parking is free -- no permit parking in Cambridge on Sunday, so you can park on Huron or Aberdeen Ave.<\/p> <p>You can get there by T easily from Harvard Square, take the 71 OR 73 bus to Aberdeen Ave, then walk to the other end of Aberdeen Ave, and you'll see us there. We'll be next to the bridge, on the pond side of Huron Ave,at the intersection of Aberdeen Ave.<\/p> <p>If you're late, and we've already started, start walking counter-clockwise.

An event which took years in the making, Reggae in the Park, demanded the combined efforts of the leadership team of the Franklin Park Zoo, commanding officers of the Massachusetts State Police and stewardship of key members of the city of Boston to make the landmark event work. Reggae in the Park is a \"Coachella type\" park gathering where people of all walks of life can gather and enjoy the sweet, soothing sounds of top performing artists who perform the genre of music commonly known as Reggae - popular in the Caribbean diaspora and originating from Jamaica.<\/p> <p>Popular artists such as Beres Hammond, Morgan Heritage and more are a few that have graced the stage much to the delight of thousands of adoring fans.<\/p> <p>Reggae in the Park fuses multi-generational gaps; genders, ages, cultures all come together to pay tribute to music adding to the thread that weaves the cloth of \"togetherness and diversity\" within the city of Boston. Slated annually at the beginning of the summer months, Reggae in the Park is an event that encourages attendees to bring out their lounge chairs, sample Caribbean cuisine and take a journey to the Caribbean islands through song, dance and networking.<\/p> <p>For a short 4-5 hour time-frame, patrons are treated to true \"island life\" in their North American homeland.<\/p> <p>The team at Lion Entertainment remain extremely grateful to the authorities and the patrons alike who attend this event every year since 2014. Relatively incident-free, Reggae in the Park has been given its approval again this year, and on Sunday August 9, we look forward to welcoming award winning musical acts to the city of Boston for another memorable performance.<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing <b>YOU<\/b> and your family &amp; friends at Reggae in the Park 2015!<\/p>",

The presentation will focus on adding additional revenue streams to your real estate brokerage business including:<\/p> <p>1.Making money by helping us acquire properties: Think it would be easier to approach an expired listing or FSBO with an offer in hand from a cash buyer? We'll show you how to easily get in front of more sellers.<br\/>2.Our Automated Short Sale System:Learn how to capitalize on short sales while keeping your sanity. Our automated short sale program allows agents to spend a very limited amount of time and effort while maximizing their commissions.<br\/>3.Buyer Lead Overflow:we don't work with buyers, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't. Learn how working with an investor can provide you with an overflow of buyer leads and how we generate these leads(mostly by accident).<br\/>4.Learn how to make money by wholesaling properties &amp; raising capital: we'll show you how to easily and effectively add these two revenue streams to your real estate business.<\/p> <p>As an added bonus, we will be reviewing our best practices and systems to allow you to leverage your time and efforts in 2015.<\/p> <p>Tom is a principle of Ocean City Development and is head of acquisitions.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

I (Lovey) am\u00a0usually wearing a teal harness with green &amp; black climbing shoes. \u00a0Climb for 1.5 to 3 hrs. <b>Adults of all skill levels and ages welcomed.<\/b>\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>**If you are leading, you should have your own rope. Work it out with your partner as to whose rope you'll be using if only one rope will be used between the two of you. Sometimes lead climbers prefer to lead on their own rope so both lead climbers may bring their own ropes to use. Word of caution: other climbers may help themselves to the second rope when it's not in use.<\/p> <p><br\/>**If you come late, come find me or\u00a0ask the CRG staff for help. \u00a0They know we climb on Mondays and can help you find the group.\u00a0<\/p> <p>**There is another meetup\u00a0group\u00a0(and\u00a0perhaps a second) that also climbs Watertown Mondays nights.

His lab asks many exciting questions relevant to our own sea shores outside Boston, and other coastal areas: How do resource availability, habitat degradation and predation risk affect population dynamics, migratory behavior, community structure, and ecosystem functioning? How can these insights inform the conservation biology of economically important species, such as lobster, cod, herring, monkfish, oysters, and seagrass? How do management initiatives such as closed areas, fishing gear modifications, and fishing reductions impact habitat recovery and sustainability of fisheries?<\/p> <p>Dr. Julie Simpson of MIT Sea Grant studies the ecology of coastal habitats such as salt marshes. Her diverse projects includes: tracing terrestrial pollutants (metals, fertilizers, pharmacuitcals, etc) and their impacts on these habitats, modeling the effects of climate change on these habitats, measuring ability of eel grasses to store carbon, and designing autonomous vehicles (marine robots) to explore these habitats. As a member of the MIT Sea Grant\u2019s Marine Advisory Services, Julie applies her research to local environmental and economic issues facing our coastal community, and participates in educational programs..<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Science by the Pint<\/b> is sponsored by an organization of Harvard graduate students called Science in the News.\u00a0 In between their sleepless hours of hard work at Harvard Med School, they bring cutting edge scientific research to the public in a fun and informal format.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>The Burren<\/b> is located on Elm Street right in the heart of Davis Square, just a short walk from the Red Line stop.\u00a0 If you prefer to drive, there are metered spots on the st<a href=\"https:\/\/seagrant.mit.edu\/index_about.php\">Read more about MIT Sea Grant activities <\/a>reet and in nearby municipal lots (see link below).\u00a0 Meters are active until 8:00 PM, and metered spots are free thereafter.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>",

Dustin's recent release marks the culmination of a seven year journey. He has just released two groundbreaking books on Integral Religion and Spirituality. These two books, Streams of Wisdom and Evolution's Ally, trace a new path for our world's great wisdom traditions. Using explicit examples and with crystal clear vision, DiPerna shows how our world's religions can help us \"Wake up\" through deeper states of consciousness as well as \"Grow Up\" through various developmental structures of consciousness. Ultimately, DiPerna provides a pathway for religion and spirituality to have a massively positive impact on consciousness, culture, and society.<\/p> <p>Ken Wilber has strongly endorsed both books stating: \"DiPerna's work fundamentally changes the way religion and spirituality can (and should) be practiced.\"<\/p> <p>Elsewhere Wilber writes: \"DiPerna's offering provides a series of brilliant first steps toward a vibrant trans-lineage spirituality.\"<\/p> <p>To express his full support for Dustin's work, Ken Wilber wrote the Foreword to each volume.<\/p> <p>Please come and support Dustin as he shares his work with the Boston community. The evening will consist of lecture, group discussion, as well as meditative and inter-subjective practice. If you are interested in learning more about spirituality, integral theory, or how a deeper connection to Ultimate Reality can flourish in your life, this is an evening not to be missed!<\/p> <p><b>About Dustin:<\/b><\/p> <p>Dustin DiPerna is founder of Bright Alliance and Co-Founder of Synergy Forum He is an author, group facilitator, and meditation instructor. Dustin received a Bachelor of Science degree from Cornell University and a Master of Liberal Arts degree in Religion from Harvard University. He is author of three books: The Coming Waves, Streams of Wisdom, Evolution's Ally. In addition to being an internationally recognized expert in the field of Integral Theory, Dustin practices in the spiritual lineages of Mahamudra and Dzogchen.

Let's move!<\/p> <p>We will be gathering at the Swampscott sign at the intersection of Lynn Shore Drive and Eastern Ave (at the Lynn\/Swampscott border) for a walk from Swampscott to Nahant and back. It is approximately 3.5 miles round trip (about an hour) could be more if people are feeling energetic.<\/p> <p>Get some steps in and enjoy chatting with friends. Come early and make a day at the beach. Great park at Red Rock if you want to just sit and watch the waves for a while.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>(Please note: many of the friends who attend regularly are not Meetup members, so there are always more people attending that it says on the Meetup site.)<\/p> <p>About This Meditation Meetup<\/p> <p>We sit in silence for around 45 minutes, followed by discussion for around 30 minutes or so. The silent sitting is interspersed with some meditation instruction, perhaps a brief reading, a little simple inquiry, exploration or movement. Sitting posture is relaxed, either on a meditation cushion or a bench. It's not a rigid practice- move whenever you need to!<\/p> <p>We meet every Monday night, 7:30 pm at the Cambridge Friends Meeting House. The Friends Meeting House is located at 5 Longfellow Park, Cambridge, MA 02138 You can find a very good map here:\u00a0&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.fmcquaker.org\/FMC-Map_2006.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/fmcquaker.org\/about-friends-meeting-at-cambridge\/directions\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/fmcquaker.org\/about-friends-meeting-at-cambridge\/directions\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Parking is available after 6:00 in the loop off of Brattle St. that leads to the Friend's House, and there is a small lot in back of the Friend's House for those with limited mobility. After that, parking is a little tricky in Cambridge (lots of \"resident only\" signs), but you will find available parking on Mount Auburn St. near Friend's House and on Brattle St. as you head away from Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>Coming by the T is a great option, with the Friend's House being a lovely 15 minute walk out of Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>If you find you are running late, come anyway! The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>This summer series of Irish set dancing classes is for beginners who want to learn the basic movements of set dancing while getting a feeling of accomplishment by dancing whole sets through from beginning to end each night. These are good refresher classes for fairly-new dancers, as well, or \"improvers\" who want to get more familiar with the various sets.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We welcome more experienced dancers to join in the classes, as well, but the focus is on teaching beginners; in fact, it really helps the new dancers enjoy the classes more when they\u00a0have a partner who knows the steps already. We all love sharing what we know and there is great satisfaction in helping newbies learn set dancing.<\/p> <p>We teach basic footwork and movements to specific sets during the 8 weeks of classes. We teach one set per night, figure by figure, then dance the whole set at the end of the night. By the end of the series of classes, the new dancer should have enough experience and confidence to join in any set dancing group and start to really enjoy the social and physical benefits of Irish set dancing.\u00a0<\/p> <p>No partner is needed. Leather-soled shoes are recommended, or shoes that don't stick (most sneakers will stick), as set dancing has a lot of gliding movements. Wear comfortable clothes (think cotton t-shirts and loose pants).<\/p> <p>The cost is $8.00 per class* - pay as you go - no need to sign up for the whole series.\u00a0[*$7 per class for Harrington's regular set dancers]\u00a0<\/p> <p>Frank and Eileen have been enthusiastically teaching beginner summer classes for several years and will continue to teach the classes, but we also have special guest teachers this summer.\u00a0<\/p>",

A new moon on August 14, 2015 will create perfect conditions for watching the meteor shower.<\/p> <p>When Can I See the Perseids?<\/p> <p>The Perseid meteor shower, one of the brighter meteor showers of the year, occur every year between July 17 and August 24. The shower tends to peak around August 9-13.<\/p> <p>The best time to view the Perseids, or most other meteor showers is when the sky is the darkest. Most astronomers suggest that depending on the Moon\u2019s phase, the best time to view meteor showers is right before dawn.<\/p> <p>Comet Swift-Tuttle<\/p> <p>Made of tiny space debris from the comet Swift-Tuttle, the Perseids are named after the constellation Perseus. This is because the direction, or radiant, from which the shower seems to come in the sky lies in the same direction as the constellation Perseus, which can be found in the north-eastern part of the sky.<\/p> <p>While the skies light up several time a year by other meteor showers , the Perseids are widely sought after by astronomers and stargazers. This is because at its peak, one can see 60 to a 100 meteors in an hour from a dark place.<\/p> <p>Where Can I See the Perseids?<\/p> <p>The Perseids can be seen in the Northern Hemisphere. Look between the radiant, which will be in the north-east part of the sky and the zenith (the point in sky directly above you).<\/p> <p>While you can easily see a shooting star with the naked eye just looking straight up, the table below shows the exact direction of the Orionids from your location.

The hikes are suited for caregivers who carry their children (usually up to 2 y\/o) and for young children who walk\/run. No stroller hikes unless specified in the details of the hike.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>SYNOPSIS:<\/p> <p>In 1987, five young men, using brutally honest rhymes and hardcore beats, put their frustration and anger about life in the most dangerous place in America into the most powerful weapon they had: their music. Taking us back to where it all began, Straight Outta Compton tells the true story of how these cultural rebels\u2014armed only with their lyrics, swagger, bravado and raw talent\u2014stood up to the authorities that meant to keep them down and formed the world's most dangerous group, N.W.A. And as they spoke the truth that no one had before and exposed life in the hood, their voice ignited a social revolution that is still reverberating today.<\/p> <p>Straight Outta Compton stars O'Shea Jackson Jr., Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell as Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy-E, and is directed by F. Gary Gray (Friday, Set It Off, The Italian Job). The drama is produced by original N.W.A members Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, who are joined by fellow producers Tomica Woods-Wright, Matt Alvarez, Gray and Scott Bernstein. Will Packer serves as executive producer of the film alongside Adam Merims, David Engel, Bill Straus, Thomas Tull and Jon Jashni.<\/p> <p>Rated R<\/p> <p>Read more: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jamn945.com\/contests\/jamn-945-sneak-screening-straight-outta-compton-the-story-of-nwa\/388772#ixzz3hmUqacdw\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.jamn945.com\/contests\/jamn-945-sneak-screening-straight-outta-compton-the-story-of-nwa\/388772#ixzz3hmUqacdw<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/-F5WcFPDzko\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/-F5WcFPDzko<\/a><\/p>",

Microservices are increasingly being used on cloud based platforms to realize the goals of increased agility in developing software and increased scalability and resiliency in running it (Netflix and Nike have both used AWS to deploy and manage microservice architectures). We\u2019ll take a look at some of the characteristics of a microservice, discuss the pros and cons, and see how to use Amazon\u2019s new API Gateway service and AWS Lambda to build \u201cserver-less\u201d\u00a0micro services.<\/p> <p><i>Speaker:<\/i><br\/><b>Joe Grenier<\/b> is a Senior Software Engineer with BlueMetal Architects. In more than 15 years in IT he has worked across a variety of industries, including finance, health care, e-commerce and non-profit.

Software solutions from companies like Apigee, Mulesoft, WSO2 have been options in the API Management space for several years now. On July 9th, Amazon jumped into the fray to provide their own API Management solution called API Gateway. This session provide a contrast and comparison of both WSO2 API Manager and AWS API Gateway including an overview of features such as: Security, Message Throttling, Message Proxying, Audit Logs, Consumption Lifecycle, Publishing Lifecycle, Cost<\/p> <p><i>Speaker:<\/i><br\/><b>Chris Riley\u00a0<\/b>is a founding Partner at HKM and has focused on the services and integration space since 1995 in a variety of pilot, implementation and training roles with companies such as PTC, IBM, Workday(formerly Cape Clear) and SOA Systems.

Well now you can have all of those things at the best <i>Track workout<\/i> ever.<\/p> <p>Interest peaked?

Skip it if you would rather just wing it and meet us at the track. We'll fill you in there.<\/p> <p>If you have never run on a track before, don't worry if none of this makes sense right now. As much as I will try to prep you, it usually just takes a few laps around the track for all of this to sink in.<\/p> <p><b>The Workout<\/b><\/p> <p>The workouts vary on a weekly basis and are usually interval based. We sometimes do workouts that are fun and different. Come see what this weeks workout is!<\/p> <p><b>What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>1. The distances (200, 400, 800, etc.) are the distances we run on the track. Each lap around the track is 400 meters.<\/p> <p>2. Each lap is supposed to be run at a certain speed, based on your 5k pace. Don't know what your 5k pace is? Read my instructions below to calculate your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>*3. The recovery interval (RI), which is indicated in parentheses, may be a specified timed interval or a distance that you walk\/jog.<\/p> <p><b>Things to remember<\/b><\/p> <p>Track workouts are supposed to be FUN! Don't be intimidated or dread a track workout. This is supposed to be a fun supplement to your other \"normal\" runs. With all of us out there encouraging each other it should be a blast.<\/p> <p>Bring a running stopwatch\/wristwatch if you have one! Using the start\/lap\/stop function will help you pace yourself on each lap.<\/p> <p>Don't push it! If something hurts or starts to feel tight, don't risk an injury because you ran too hard on your first track workout of the summer. We have plenty of time to ease in...<\/p> <p>Bring water for the end!!!<\/p> <p><b>5k pace instructions<\/b><\/p> <p>Decide how fast you would like to run a 5k. Choose a time that is reasonable yet challenging. Convert that time to seconds, and divide the seconds by 12.5 (the number of 400 meter laps it takes to run 5k). That is your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>As an example, I might decide a reasonable yet challenging goal time for a 5k is 24 minutes.<\/p> <p>24 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 1440 seconds<\/p> <p>1440 seconds divided by 12.5 laps in a 5k ~= 115 seconds \/ lap<\/p> <p>This means that I will run the workout according to a pace of 115 seconds \/ lap.<\/p> <p>I will also have pacing charts available at the track, so don't fret.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.informalrunning.com\/category\/blog\/\">Blog<\/a><\/b><\/p>",

It's based on the War of the Austrian Succession (and actually packs a lot of historical chrome into an easy-to-learn set of rules) but you don't really need to know or care about the history behind the game to play it -- it's noteworthy as one of the favorite historical wargame of people who don't usually play historical wargames. It's also a favorite game of a number of people in this group, but also a game that's sometimes hard to get people together to play. I aim to remedy this.

There have been a lot of new additions to the group, and it's great to see new friendships being made over board games...<\/p> <p>Although we start around 6:45pm or so, early birds (before 6pm) can take advantage of their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.notyouraveragejoes.com\/medford\/2012\/09\/04\/late-night-happy-hour\/\">half-price happy hour menu<\/a>. These are full-portion sized appetizers for real cheap! If not, you'll still be able to take advantage of the monthly specials.<\/p> <p>HOW TO GET THERE<\/p> <p>This location is easily accessible from Rt. 16, Rt. 28 and Rt. 93, and is walking distance from the T, near the new Station Landing apartment complex. Here is a map of the area.<\/p> <p>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p> <p>See you there!!<\/p>",

(Over time, I'd like to see us host our discussions, but I don't see a bar or restaurant as a bad place to meet at first first.)<\/p> <p>This month, let's discuss Greece. The ongoing crisis has implications for the success of the European integration project, and raises a number of other interesting questions. What does it say about the state of current global financial governance? Are critics like Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman right that a focus on austerity is single minded, or are proponents of austerity correct that \"shock therapy\" is the key to long-term macroeconomic stability? Are IMF structural adjustment programs, in general, geared for the ways countries actually have developed historically? Let's discuss these and other issues over some good food and drinks!<\/p> <p>UPDATE 8\/2: I'm just going to set the official time 15 min early so everybody has time to get there for our 7pm reservation. Plus, it leaves some time for a bit of foyer talk.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>\"Windows to the Past: Discovering History Through Tangible Things\" Join us for a series of interactive discussions that complement the free HarvardX course, Tangible Things. The online course, led by Harvard Professor Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, introduces an understanding of how people make history through objects\u2014the things they gather, create, collect, exhibit, exchange, throw away, or ignore.<\/p> <p>This in-person discussion series is intended to allow anyone--from the casually interested, to antique collectors, to museum professionals--to work together in person, ask questions, and engage with real life objects. Participants will assess fascinating objects from Harvard\u2019s collections, as well as from the kinds of collections found in your very own attic, to see how any material thing, when examined closely, can be a link between the present and past.<\/p> <p>This series is free and open to the public. Please RSVP online through Eventbrite (<a href=\"http:\/\/hvrd.me\/QfJAt\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/hvrd.me\/QfJAt<\/a>). Refreshments will be served.<\/p>",

Our concept is simple: meet other travelers or expats, chat about where you've been and where they've been, and get inspired for your next trip. Everyone with an open mind and sense of adventure is welcome, whether you're a travel novice or an experienced travel junkie.<\/p> <p>In Aug, we're back at the White Horse Tavern in Allston. This is a great space with lots of room to mingle. Parking can be a little tricky in Allston, but it's easily accessible by bus &amp; T (green line).<\/p> <p>Please note: Active solicitation of members at our meetups by commercial organizations is contrary to the spirit of the group. Please stay away if you are a travel company just looking to promote your business! Thank you :)<\/p>",

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<\/p> <p>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<\/p> <p>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/p> <p>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<\/p> <p>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<\/p> <p>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/p> <p>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/p> <p>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<\/p> <p>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><b><i>Alternate Tuesdays at 7:30 PM at Unity of Somerville, located at 6 William Street at the corner of College Avenue<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Call (913)[masked] to learn more<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Relaxed, informal wine and food tasting -- novice or expert, you will enjoy it.<\/p> <p><br\/>Afterwards about 8:30pm, those who are interested can join us for a sit-down dinner at EVOO. NOTE: $$ for dinner is NOT included in RSVP; the menu has medium and large entrees, so the choice is up to you. Last time we did this event those that stayed for dinner just had an entree with another glass of wine, so the total tab per person came to about $25 + $25 = $50 each.<\/p> <p>About age restriction. We occasionally do age-specific events like this one to encourage new members to come out and see what the group is all about. Please keep the age restriction in mind when you RSVP.<\/p> <p><b><i>COST<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>PRICE: $25 payable with your RSVP<\/b><\/p> <p>Usual BostonWine refund policy applies.\u00a0I will offer a full refund up to 24-hours prior to the event.

You must answer \"Yes\" in this event's RSVP to attend. (Note, apparently some versions of the Meetup mobile app don't display this question -- in that case, RSVP with your phone and then use a web browser later on to update your RSVP).\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>WHAT TO BRING\u00a0<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>Yourself!

Here is <a href=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/9\/f\/e\/highres_16055326.jpeg\">a map of the area<\/a>.<\/p> <p>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that MTG Boston members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Hi all! For this second meetup, the tentative plan is to repeat the approximately 2.5 mile loop from the first, which begins in front of the East Boston branch of the Boston Public Library, centrally located at 365 Bremen St. We will utilize the car-free paths of the Bremen Street Park, go onto the Greenway, and make a loop at the East Piers Park eventually making our way back to the library. Of course, everyone should run at their pace, but at the same time faster EBRunners should strive to provide company to the less experienced EBRunners so nobody is running alone for long stretches. Let's hope the weather cooperates, but there is no plan to cancel in the event of a little rain. Please, please make sure running is a safe activity for you before participating. With that said, I look forward to seeing you! Happy Running, Ilya<\/p>",

I doubt this will be much of an issue, given our typical attendance numbers.<\/p> <p>* Because our events tend to be small, and the games we typically play tend to be long, if at all possible, please let us know if you plan to be more than a couple of minutes late so that we don't launch into something without you. Likewise, if you're planning on arriving more than a half-hour late, you should be aware that it may not be possible to include you in a game. You're welcome to come by and hang out but the chances are better than even that we'll be hip-deep in gaming goodness by the time you arrive.<\/p> <p>* Please be respectful of our hosts; stay mindful of closing time and throw 'em some business if you're hungry.<\/p> <p>* Have fun and roll high!<\/p>",

Unfortunately we can\u2019t control the weather and we can\u2019t observe when there are clouds, haze, or rain; so when the weather is bad, the Open Night will be canceled.

To find out if the Open Night will be held, call our information number at[masked], no earlier than two hours before the scheduled starting time.

        "description": "<p>Join 50 to 80 or 100 dancers any Wednesday at Dance Freedom!!<\/p> <p>We are the original barefoot weekly dance, continuously running for 44 years, that has spawned hundreds if not thousands of other dances around the world.<\/p> <p>In a drug, alcohol, and shoe-free environment, we've been making friends and sharing safe and juicy dances for decades. Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome! For more information, E-mail: [masked]<\/p>",

Just read a real estate investing book<br\/>b. Attended your first seminar<br\/>c. Watched a late night infomercial<br\/>d. Listened to a webinar<\/p> <p>And You:<\/p> <p>a. Were told real estate is the fastest way to make money<br\/>b. Are convinced that you will be able to leave the job that you hate within the next 2 weeks<br\/>c. Thought about or have already paid $20,000 for a coaching program<\/p> <p>But You:<\/p> <p>a. Don't know what to do next<br\/>b. Were told by someone that it would never work<br\/>c. Are losing your confidence rapidly<\/p> <p>Don't be embarrassed. Every person that got into real estate that wasn't hand held by a family member and grew up in the business started out the same way. 90 percent or more of those who have gotten excited about real estate never ended up even trying. Thinking big, attracting money, and being in control of your own destiny sound good, especially when a polished salesperson is the one painting the picture. The reality is: Real Estate is a business and it is hard work. The only people who will tell you otherwise are trying to sell you something(seminar, a coaching program, a book, a subscription). That's the bad news.<\/p> <p>The good news is that there are a ton of easy steps that you can take in order to start moving in the right direction without doing anything drastic. And, if you put in the work, the results will come. On this webinar, Tom Cafarella of Ocean City Development, will discuss:<\/p> <p>1. Why real estate is the toughest industry to get into<br\/>2. How it can be the best industry to be in once you have momentum<br\/>3. Steps that you can take this week to start your real estate career<br\/>4. The basics of wholesaling<\/p> <p>5.\u00a0 Our training program that allows you inside access to our exact marketing programs that you can use to find deals to wholesale<\/p> <p>Tom is a principle of Ocean City Development and is head of acquisitions for the company.

        "description": "<p>NUTSHELL - every week\u00a0day, 12:15ish until 1:45ish,\u00a0Cumnock Turf Fields\u00a0at Harvard Stadium, games of 4v4 up to 10v10 or larger depending on who shows, bring a white shirt and a dark\/colored shirt (but not a gray one), almost never canceled, read\u00a0below for more details before asking questions that are answered here, and read the comments for today's meetup to see if there is\u00a0anything important\u00a0about today.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\"><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT - Harvard Square is the closest T stop (red line). \u00a0Check Google Maps or other to find fastest way there from wherever you are.<\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY RIDE SHARE - a lot of players in this meetup come by car and are nice enough to offer rides to others. Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p><b>***********************<\/b><\/p> <p>To join the August Tournament please just go through our Join Page:\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/TennisNorthEast.com\/join\"><a href=\"http:\/\/TennisNorthEast.com\/join\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/TennisNorthEast.com\/join<\/a><\/a><br\/>***********************<\/p> <p><br\/><b>How does the TennisNorthEast Tournament Work?<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Every Match Counts *NEW* for 2015<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Tennis Tournament Basic Concept<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0Our tournaments are a single elimination format with a consolation bracket. Meaning you are guaranteed at least 2 matches. This tournament format will not be played at a single location over a weekend instead players are given 7 to 10 days to play each round's match.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Our tournaments will be mixed gender unless we have particularly strong female enrollment in a city. The tournaments will be singles based until we receive enough response to open it up for doubles. Players will be grouped in brackets with players no greater than .5 of their current TLN League Rating. Meaning Skilled - 3.0 players will be matched with other 3.0 players and at most with Competitive - 3.5 level players. Competitive - 3.5 level players could be grouped with Advanced - 4.0 players but will not have Elite 4.5 level players in their bracket.<\/p> <p><b>Our Guarantee<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0We need at least 6 players to make a tournament bracket. If we can NOT reach this criteria then we will <i>refund<\/i> your entry fee and <i>give you<\/i> the next tournament for <i>no cost<\/i>. Our hope is to run multiple skill level brackets for each tournament. We are NOT going to show early enrollment for the tournaments. Also the 7-day money back guarantee expires as soon as the tournament starts. Tournaments will not allow for late enrollment.<\/p> <p><b>Leveling<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0All tournament players will need to have played <i>4 league\/season or tennis ladder legacy matches<\/i> before they can enter into a tournament. Players will be entered into the tournament that associates with their TLN's Player Rating. If a player wants to participate in a second draw at a rating higher than their Player Rating they will be allowed too.<\/p> <p><b>Your Schedule and Availability<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0These tournaments will be kicked off on Thursday's giving the first round opponents two weekends to play the first match and then each following round will have a full week to play the match. Players need to be local for at least the first 3 weeks after kickoff. Players with 1-week work trips or week long vacations during the first 3 weeks shouldn't participate in the tournament.<\/p> <p><b>Seedings<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The TennisNorthEast staff will seed 25% of the participants based veteran status (Most number of matches played in their career) with the program. If we have 8 players enrolled we'll seed the top 2 players, 16 players the top 4 players. The rest of the players will be randomly entered into the draw.<\/p> <p><b>Consolation Bracket<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0We will run a consolation bracket for the players who lost their first match. Seedings for the consolation bracket will be randomly selected by the TennisNorthEast staff. The winner of the consolation bracket will receive a $25 Tennis Warehouse Gift Card.<\/p> <p><b>Where to Play?<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 Because the seeding of the tournament is mainly randomize the higher seed will NOT have home court preference. The league strongly suggests you meet half-way to cut the commute in half for both players. We provide an extensive list of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tennisnortheast.com\/TennisCourts\">tennis courts<\/a> that have user submitted ratings. If two players need guidance they can certainly email our staff for suggestions.<\/p> <p><b>Playing Format<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The preferred playing format for tournaments should be 2 sets with a 3rd set tie-breaker or 2 out of 3 sets. If the two players can't agree the default format will be the 2 sets with a 3rd set tie-breaker. In NYC we will accept 10 game pro set results mainly due to court availability.<\/p> <p><b>Target Audience<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 This will be our most competitive format. The target audience is for the player who are good sports and love to play competitive matches.<\/p> <p><b>Prize Pool<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0The prize pool will be based upon enrollment in each bracket. A tournament can have multiple brackets. The tournament prize structure is based around our partner Tennis Warehouse (TW).<\/p> <p><b>6 to 10 players:<\/b> $50 TW Gift Card for the winner*, $25 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for Consolation bracket winner<br\/><b>11 to 16:<\/b> $100 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $50 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for Consolation winner<br\/><b>17 to 24:<\/b> $150 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $50 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for 3rd &amp; 4th place, $50 TW GC for Consolation winner<br\/><b>25+:<\/b> $200 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $100 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for 3rd and 4th place, $50 TW GC for Consolation winner<\/p> <p>\u00a0All tournament champions will be receive an entry into the End of the Year National Tourneys at the champions discounted rate.<\/p> <p><b>Cost to Participate<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0The cost will be $19.95 per tournament except for the inaugural tournament which will be $19.95.<\/p> <p><b>Join Today!!<\/b><\/p> <p>So <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tennisnortheast.com\/join\">Join Today<\/a> and we'd be happy to get you enrolled into the next tournament.<\/p>",

Zahili Gonzalez Zamora, trained at Havana\u2019s National Conservatory of Music, was playing classical music ten hours a day by age 14 and it was only after touring as a professional musician that she discovered her love for improvisation and jazz. Now the talented arranger and composer, expanding her musical prowess and constantly challenging herself by reentering school at Berklee, leads her band with vocals and on the piano. The Zahili Gonzalez Zamora Project, which features a drummer, an upright bassist, two horn players and a tenor saxophone, plays irresistible and sensual jazz fusion.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>\"A universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience is not only possible but necessary. It is this experience toward which the course is directed.\" (ACIM Manual for Teachers)<\/p> <p>Designed to correct perception and lead to a universal experience of knowledge, A Course In Miracles has been translated into 23 languages, is referenced and utilized by many of today's most reknowned spiritual teachers, and has inspired countless books and curriculums based on its teachings. But it can be a difficult book to grasp. It is lengthy, the writing is abstract, and its use of Christian terminology alienates many.<\/p> <p>And yet it has become one of the most influential spiritual books of today.\u00a0Join us as we dive into it, and are led to understand its principles against the backdrop of our own personal experiences and insights.\u00a0Beginner as well as advanced Course students are welcome. We'll start with a short meditation, and then use a reading from the Course as an entry point into our\u00a0time\u00a0together. Cost $5 per person.<\/p> <p>Bringing a copy of the book is helpful, but not necessary. Recommended (but again not necessary) is the combined volume that includes the three supplements (Clarification of Terms; Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process, and Practice; The Song of Prayer), available online from The Foundation For Inner Peace at <a href=\"http:\/\/acim.org\">acim.org<\/a>.<\/p>",

If you're a beginner or just interested in culture, you'll fit in fine! Don't miss out on this opportunity to learn and practice over a few drinks. Can't make it on time? Need to leave early? Not a problem. Just stop by if you can!<\/p> <p><b>If you are &gt;21 and plan to drink, please bring a MA state issued ID or passport. Other state IDs may not be accepted. Please order at the bar and take care of your own tab.<\/b><\/p> <p>Transportation: I highly recommend using public transportation. Not only is driving while intoxicated dangerous, but there may not be any parking available in the area. A lot of the <b>parking on Newbury St \u00a0is Residential Only <\/b>in the evenings, and many of the signs indicating this are very well hidden. If you insist on parking in the area, be aware that meter maids love handing out parking tickets around here.\u00a0Best methods for public transportation are the green line subway or bus #1 to the Hynes stop.<\/p> <p>I have made an arrangements with the Itadaki staff for a simpler ordering method. Last time was very chaotic and stressful for the bartender, so lets do our best to not confuse the bartender. :)<\/p> <p><b>Ordering at Itadaki<\/b><\/p> <p>1) Order your first drink at the bar. If it's alcoholic, your ID will be checked at this time. You will also be \u00a0given a guest number to use the rest of the night.<\/p> <p>2) If you're at a table, the bartender will try to make several rounds throughout the night to take additional orders. Keep using your guest number and please feel free to order more food and drinks.<\/p> <p>3) Keep in mind we're a pretty large group so don't be offended or annoyed with the bartender if he doesn't get to you right away. If you have an urgent order, go request it at the bar.<\/p> <p>4) Please take care of your tab and don't forget to tip*. The management and staff are doing a lot to make this all possible.<\/p> <p>*Note: If the group is large, an 18% tip may already be included.<\/p> <p>See you there!<br\/>~Lindsay<\/p>",

Isolated in the house, Paula starts to hear strange noises and see odd things. Is she really going insane or is her husband making her mad?

We alternate walks between the inner and outer loops which are both under 3 miles. It usually takes less than an hour. We walk past a playground too, so we could stop and play there for a while. Afterwards, we sit at the picnic tables under the trees by the visitor center and feed our babies, chat, etc.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will meet outside the visitor center in the upper parking lot on the Saugus side of the park, past the Kasabuski Skating Rink. \u00a0There are bathrooms with a changing table in the visitor center too.<\/p> <p>Running late? \u00a0No prob.

We will then be holding our w-Rap Mixer listening to the sounds of classic rap beats with drinks and snacks to end the week. What better way to end the work week on a Friday?! So come join us in celebration. You can find a list of all the \u00a0events and activities at the other local Boston coworking spaces here\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/50YMv9\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/50YMv9<\/a>.

All of our members are revenue-generating and over half are veteran entrepreneurs with multiple businesses. Our spaces and events are built to make it easier for entrepreneurs to bounce ideas off each other. Community is very important to us, as we work to connect our members to the startup ecosystem, investors, and others who can help you grow.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>About Coworking Week<\/b>:\u00a0In 2005 an independent worker in California conceived of a different way of working; he envisioned a place where independent workers could come together, collaborate and reap the rewards of community, increased productivity and creativity. That worker was Brad Neuberg and the word he used to describe his vision was coworking, and he was a founder of Coworking (a one day a week reserved space in another community center in 2005) and a co-founder of The Hat Factory. On August 9th, approximately 500 coworking spaces around the world will celebrate Neuberg\u2019s vision as part of International Coworking Day. Boston will be celebrating the week of August 10th-14th\u00a0<\/p>",

This FREE Orientation class will get you familiar with how everything works at CBI. The orientation class is the gateway to everything that CBI has to offer, whether you\u2019re a seasoned sailor or brand new to boats. Done entirely on the dock, your orientation will include a guided tour of CBI\u2019s boats and facilities, an overview of our classes and programs, as well as plenty of time to ask the questions that matter to you as a sailor. All orientations meet at the base of the American Flag Pole out on the dock, and runs for about half an hour. All are welcome to this class!<\/p> <p><br\/>Afterwards, we invite you to meet one another and ask about other Orientation class attendees' prior experience with sailing. Perhaps you can find a friend to take the Beginner Sailing classes together with once you join.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Friday Nights are also when CBI members go out for Informal Racing, so it is an exciting night to watch the sailors and learn more about how you can progress your skills after learning to sail. Certainly ask your Orientation instructor about the Friday Night Informal Racing and Informal Instruction if he or she does not mention it.

Remember, these boats don\u2019t have engines and we will have to rely on the wind power.

Not your grandpa\u2019s blues band, their live show has been captivating audiences in the U.S. and Canada with a second-line horn entrance, cigar box guitars and electric push brooms to Allman Brothers style jams and their rapping trombone player. Both Preston McEwen behind the drums and Matt Karner on the bass guitar are a punishing rhythm section behind frontman Matt Isbell with raunchy cigar box guitar licks and chainsaw rhythms. With the addition of Trombonist Suavo Jones, Jeremy Powell on keys and finally Josh Roberts on lead guitar, the grooves go from funky to funk-nasty as the band gains more notoriety in the blues and jam circuit.<\/p> <p>Ghost Town Blues Band is a modern blues band with an intimate knowledge of both blues, rock and improvisational jams. At the same time, the band\u2019s raw energy and intensity is reminiscent of some of the best blues that rock n' roll has ever offered. The band can turn on a dime from North Mississippi hill country grooves to classic electric urban blues and funk and Allman Brothers style jams. This Memphis-based, gritty, seven-piece has been touring the US and Canada since its inception in 2009, gaining a strong following within the Blues and Jam Band circuit.<\/p> <p>\u201cGTBB shows what can happen when the past is distilled through young sensibilities, voices, and instruments.

Hell, we\u2019ll even throw a classical music concert or two. What's in store this week? Let's find out:<\/p> <p>Learn about the history iconic Roland products (like the TR-808, TR-909, TB-303, SH-101, PROMARS etc) and how in the hands of artists, they played a role in shaping today\u2019s music genres. This event is designed for musicians and music aficionados to be able to learn about both the history and technology of electronic music production and performance. With roots in the very origins of electronic music, AIRA is a new series of products designed to meet the evolving needs of today's electronic musicians. In the studio or on the stage, AIRA brings genre-defining sounds and modern performance features to a new generation. While computers dominate so many music production activities today, artists still seek inspiration through the sonic character and responsive feel of traditional analog hardware. AIRA products emphasize the spontaneous creativity and hands-on performance inspired by these vintage electronic instruments, while integrating neatly into today\u2019s computer-based production environments.<\/p>",

You'll get to see parts you wouldn't normally visit. Two guys pull trailers with speakers playing music. Two 15 min. stops along the way to sway and dance. \u00a0Always a party-theme, so get ready to get your costumes.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nExpect the ride part to end around 10:30 and then you have to get back to your car... unless you park at the end and bike to Copley Sq. Expect folks to go out for food and drinks afterwards, so if you're a night owl, this'll suit you fine. I just ride and go home to my pillow ; &gt;\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you're in after 5 pm and out by 8 am, you can get $10 parking at\u00a0Central Parking, 100 Clarendon St\u00a0Boston\u00a0MA\u00a002116\u00a0(617)[masked], which is right by Copley Sq and the Mass Pike and not far from I-93.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Do not expect to be able to take the commuter rail home. The ride ends too late to rely on that.\u00a0<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Our meetup starts at Deer Island water treatment plant. This is a public walkway that many people use to jog at night, it is safe, but a bit of a walk - about a 2.6 mile loop. Hiking boots recommended, as always, especially if you want to climb the hill south of the water tanks.<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll meet just after sunset and there will be no moon - it's a new moon night. \u00a0So if it's clear, it will be a good night for star trails, and perhaps a Milky Way attempt. There is plenty to shoot if you stick to the jogging path. \u00a0If you stray from the path or take the paths up the hill on the north side of the plant, you will want to have a flashlight handy, but please be considerate of others if you need to light your way.<\/p> <p>Below are some images to give you an idea. Bring your lens shades to avoid flares, anything from super-wide to medium zoom will be usable. Shooting the water tanks from the hill can even use some 200 mm zooming.<\/p> <p>Deer island is actually quite dark and we may be able to catch the Milky Way shooting south-east, which is the best part, anyway.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>It may be somewhat smelly in some of the places, this is a water \/ sewage treatment plan, but it's not too bad.<\/p> <p>There are many great and very different objects to shoot in this location, from a wind mill, rusty anchor points, water tanks, stairs, a grassy hill to the rotten poles sticking out the water. And the area is large, the group can spread out without getting into each other's way.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/9\/f\/600_440618815.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/8\/1\/6\/600_440618934.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/8\/1\/c\/600_440618940.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/8\/3\/2\/600_440618962.jpeghttp:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/8\/2\/5\/600_440618949.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/8\/3\/9\/600_440618969.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/8\/3\/c\/600_440618972.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>More pictures:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/photos\/17649482\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/photos\/17649482\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/photos\/17649482\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>",

A well attended venue for triathletes training for races of all distances.<\/p> <p>The gate opens at 7 a.m. and the Parking is right off of Walden St. Walden charges to park a their lot ($5) via a computerized parking attendant that takes cards. I'd recommend the annual pass if you think you're going to come to more meetups. Alternatively,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?saddr=Concord+High+School,+concord+ma&amp;daddr=915+Walden+Street,+Concord,+MA&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=38.93711,-75.966775&amp;sspn=13.846355,14.128418&amp;geocode=FRa1hwIdrlO_-yEidG069HujIg%3BFQqXhwIdjYW_-ylB1q82q5vjiTFsmsu3RKWVtQ&amp;gl=us&amp;mra=ls&amp;t=m&amp;z=16\">It's a short distance from Concord High School<\/a>. Some people avoid the parking fee by parking near Concord High School and then walk\/ride their bike over to Walden.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mass.gov\/dcr\/parks\/trails\/walden.pdf\">Click here for the map of the parking<\/a>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/f\/f\/4\/event_118056852.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Across and back from the beach (Pictured above) is a little over a mile mile; a perfect distance for those training for 70.3 and Ironman races.<\/p> <p>There are also some close to shore routes for people getting better acquainted with open water (see distance maps). We meet near the lifeguard house right on the beach closes to Walden street. Here is the map of walden pond.<\/p> <p>This meetup is important because you always want to swim in groups if you can. Make certain that you look out for each other. Don't attempt to swim across the pond if you haven't trained for that distance. Always match up with someone or a group that swims your pace. The beauty of Walden is that you can swim very close to shallow water and get some good open water training in.<\/p> <p>If there are people that are looking to go long for the first time, let me know in advance and I may be able to swim angel, or get a swim angel group together. That way we can do it in a controlled and safe environment.<\/p> <p>For those that are really new and nervous about open water swimming, stay tuned for a beginners clinic that I'll put on in the summer.<\/p>",

The Water Trail is located entirely in Dedham and is made a loop by Long Ditch, located in Cutler Park. The Water Trail follows the lead of organized hiking trails, by marking the trail with mile markers and signs at launches and at significant historical and ecological locations. The goal of the Water Trail is to attract visitors to the Charles and create an educational and lasting experience that would in turn create environmental stewards of the river. There are currently 5 public launch sites along the Water Trail of which several are adjacent to the many acres of Dedham\u2019s parks and conservation lands. Some of the things paddlers will encounter, besides the unique flora and fauna that the River supports, are: the landing place of Contentment's (Dedham's) first settlers in 1635; the place of the first cart path over the Charles River; Cutler Park, the largest marsh area on the Charles River; the Castle \"Riverdale\" at the Noble and Greenough School built for railroad tycoon Albert Nickerson in 1890;\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/4\/2\/6\/600_440249734.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Mother Brook, believed to be the first man made canal in the United States and the course for the first water driven, broad powered loom in the world; Powder House, built in 1766 stored military supplies through the period of the American Revolution; as well as several other sites .<\/p> <p>\n\n\nhere is the link to the water loop trail. \u00a0We are meeting at number 1 the Dolan Center:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dedhamtrails.com\/map.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.dedhamtrails.com\/map.html<\/a><\/p> <p>RENTALS:<\/p> <p>Through the generosity of L.L.

Workshop is suitable for all levels and camera types including point and shoots. Fee just $45 includes written handout covering the essentails of composition.

I enjoyed Ian's laid-back manner of instruction that was as encouraging as it was informative. I was hoping for a workshop that would get me to see things beyond the way I usually see and think about them through the lens, and that is exactly what I got. I would recommend this workshop for anyone who is trying to get a good overview of what composition is all about, and for anyone who wants to challenge themselves to get outside of their compositional comfort zone.<\/i> \u201d \"<i>I really enjoyed the workshop a lot and learned a lot. I am slowly baginning to learn how to compose a picture much better than I was doing before. the difference between a snapshot and a good picture may be slight but but makes thi pic great. It's learning the how to take a better pic that makes it a lot of fun and interresting. I hope you have another workshop soon<\/i>.\"<\/p>",

This course teaches through-hole (90% of electronic kits) soldering and is recommended for the beginner. This is a hands-on class where the students learn techniques to help them solder through-hole components. Soldering can be daunting for the first solder joint, then the 2nd solder joint is not so bad, and by the time you\u2019ve assembled the blinky grid, you will be quite confident and proficient in basic soldering skills.<\/p> <p>Classes take place at Lowell Makes. We provide all the tools, irons, solder, parts, and seats for up to 5 students.<\/p> <p>The class is expected to take around 2 hours to complete, there is a buffer built in in case we go a bit longer.<\/p> <p>Prerequisites: None! Just bring yourself. The class price includes the cost of the WeevilEye kit.<\/p> <p>What to bring: Lowell Makes will provide all the tools, irons and solder.<\/p> <p>Proceeds above will go to help support Lowell Makes.<\/p>",

I kinda fell off the face of the earth again, now didn't I?<\/p> <p>Hi all, so very sorry to have let several months pass since our last event, but I'm still making the slow adjustment to this new, travel-heavy job and it's had every weekend since May, and many weeknights as well, booked solid. I'm hoping to have this situation rectified soon, but I appreciate your continued patience and dedication to drinking whiskey (I hope you've all kept practicing in the meantime - don't get rusty).<\/p> <p>With that in mind, I invite you all to join me at 'the Last Hurrah' for a late afternoon session of drinking whiskey (from their outstanding whiskey list) and giving me hell for disappearing again.<\/p> <p>Please note that I will not be able to reserve us a table (they don't do it) so we're scheduled to arrive as they open their doors and if enough of us are there, we can grab a good table close to other tables in case late-comers show up.<\/p> <p>Also please note that ***they won't be serving food*** as they only do cocktail service on Saturday, so please either eat beforehand (good idea), or plan on joining me for a bite afterwards when we wrap things up. Please note that they don't allow outside food, so cancel that idea if you were planning to smuggle in a sandwich (but know that I like where your head is at).<\/p> <p>OK, I hope to see many of you there. Sorry for the short notice (I literally just got out of a travel plan for this weekend), and look out for a weeknight event very soon.<\/p> <p>See you saturday!<\/p>",

Bring a delectable dish and bring your own plate, bowl, utensils, mug and napkin.<\/p> <p>The fire will begin in the tipi at approximately 6:45 pm. In the spirit of exchange, please bring something to share - chocolate, wood for the fire, songs, stories, poems.\u00a0 Also, we suggest a $5 monetary donation (more if you can, less if you can't), and we will \"pass the hat\" at the fire - no amount is too small.<\/p> <p>The Community Fire is a consecrated fire, and everyone who would like to will have the opportunity to give offerings to the fire in the tradition of the Huichol people. The significance of the offerings and the procedure for making offerings will be explained at the beginning of the fire. The Huichol have loaned this way of consecrating the Fire, but the Fire is non-denominational and open to everyone.<\/p> <p>Fire is a spiritual presence that moves something in us.\u00a0 Once we consecrate the fire, we engage in \"fire work\" - a process that begins to move the energetic blocks that keep us from living a balanced, joyful life. We share stories from our lives, as well as poems, music, humor, and other creative expression.\u00a0 Community Fires are a simple, but powerful way to settle our mind and experience\u00a0the wisdom of heart, and\u00a0an opportunity to connect with each other. There\u2019s sometimes drumming and singing, sometimes jokes, and always the opportunity to share and speak about what's most important to us in our lives. This is a safe place where you can be heard. All are welcome, no matter your background, belief, tradition or non-tradition. The fires are family-friendly and open to people of all ages.\u00a0 Come share whatever needs to be spoken, and a willingness to listen from the heart. Come with your concerns, your stories, your gifts, your laughter as we connect with old friends and meet new ones, and begin to deepen into that sense of community that is so essential to support us through life.<\/p> <p>Some people partake in the smoking of tobacco around the fire.\u00a0 Tobacco is a sacred plant whose energy is very similar to the energy of Fire.\u00a0 When smoked consciously and with intention tobacco fosters connection with Fire and Heart.\u00a0 To accommodate both tobacco smokers and those not smoking tobacco, a portion of the space around the fire circle will be designated as a non-smoking section, and another portion as the smoking section.<\/p> <p>For more information about the Sacred Fire Community organization, check out <a href=\"http:\/\/sacredfirecommunity.org\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/sacredfirecommunity.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/sacredfirecommunity.org\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>After you RSVP I will email you the address of the Community Fire and some useful landmarks.<\/b><\/p> <p>See you around the Fire!<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>We will journey inward in a time-honored shamanic method of inner consultation. It is a way of communicating with your inner or spirit self and retrieving information. Your inner self is in constant communication with all aspects of your environment, seen and unseen. You need only journey within to find answers to your questions. Be prepared, however, for whatever insights you may receive, whether you like them or not.<br\/>The spirit healing journey is not always what people expect, and sometimes there is uncertainty as to what one should experience in altered states. The ecstatic trance is an individual journey into non-ordinary reality; therefore, experiences vary from person to person and from journey to journey. Once you enter a trance state, the rhythm or sound of the drum tends to change. The drumbeat may appear to speed up or slow down, while the sound may grow louder, softer, or disappear. You may experience a change in body temperature, feel energy flowing through your body, or find yourself twitching, swaying, or rocking. It is not uncommon to hear sounds or voices. You may even smell specific aromas. You may see colorful patterns, symbolic images, or dreamlike visions. Some people may find that they have a highly developed inner vision while others may rely more on instinct, intuition, or intent.<br\/>During the spirit healing journey, one's awareness transcends ordinary reality. In journeys to the Lower World, one may experience the sensation of falling, sliding, or spiraling downward into or under the Earth. In Upper World journeys, one may experience the sensation of rising, floating, flying, or spiraling upward through the air or sky. Journeys to the Lower World involve the movement of awareness to a level beneath ordinary reality and Celestial journeys involve movement to a level above ordinary reality. Lower levels are denser, lower in frequency, and more involved with the physical body, the earthly plane, and material reality. Higher levels are higher in frequency, less dense, and subtler.<br\/>You will experience at least two spiritual journeys. You do not need prior journeying experiences but an openness of the process and possibilities. Elaine is a training and practicing Shaman and will safely lead you on your journey. Please bring a yoga mat, blanket, something to cover your eyes (scarf), and journal as you may wish to write your experiences immediately following the journey. $10 Any questions or to register please contact Elaine [masked] or[masked]<\/p>",

Martins suspects foul play and sets out to discover the identity of the \u201cthird man,\u201d the mysterious witness to the incident, who is the person he hopes can reveal the true story. Shot in breathtaking black and white, with inky shadows that hide lurking figures, the film climaxes in an unforgettable chase through the labyrinthine underground sewers. Orson Welles, in relatively little screen time, dominates the film as the mesmerizing mystery man Harry Lime. Co-starring Trevor Howard and Alida Valli. Famed novelist Graham Greene adapted the dramatic screenplay from his own story; Carol Reed\u00a0(Odd Man Out, The Fallen Idol, Oliver!)\u00a0masterfully directed. Digitally restored by Deluxe Restoration, on behalf of Studiocanal, from a fine grain master positive struck from the original negative.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>100% RATING ON ROTTEN TOMATOES. \u00a0ICONIC PERFORMANCE BY ORSON WELLES.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>See you at the Movie,<\/b><\/p> <p><b>John<\/b><\/p>",

There won't be any awkward \"I hope I'm chosen before the kid in the full body cast\". The \"rules\" will be explained by the referee before playing starts. They aren't complex, and there won't be any instant replays for controversial calls.<\/p> <p>It's designed to be fun, playful, and casual. The only rule I can remember is not aiming for someone's head. Ladies, I can't guarantee that the guys are going to follow that one : ) Guys, this is still not the best way to get a woman's attention\u2026.<\/p> <p>All levels are welcome! We will be playing on a padded floor, wearing socks (<b>remember to bring socks!<\/b>).\u00a0The arena is air conditioned and is smaller than a typical dodgeball court.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/4\/1\/a\/600_314090202.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Dodgeball of Boston<\/b>\u00a0is located at 1 Broadway in Arlington, MA.

        "description": "<p>Four gifted and accomplished guitarists who are sure to wow us with an dynamic blend of sound and styles for a great summer night.<\/p> <p>Steve Marchena<br\/>An established favorite of Dedham and Boston, Steve has the talent, diversity, energy and soul to always delight an audience. \u201cMarchena\u2019s blazing guitar and perfect rhythm playing are nothing less than stunning. \u201d - Pat Keating, Insite Boston.<\/p> <p>German Schauss<br\/>Among his many accomplishments, German uses odd and even meters to fuse the classical influences of Bach, Beethoven and Chopin with modern instrumental rock guitar music through epic music structures and lush soundscapes.<\/p> <p>John Paolilli<br\/>John was voted WMRC \"best guitarist\" in the year 2012. He played in a Heineken commercial, and has recorded guitars for major label artists. Additionally, he plays over 150 shows a year with several bands. Check him out.<\/p> <p>Patrick DeCoste<br\/>\u201cLike U2 but with Van Halen-esque solos\u201d: That\u2019s how the media has described the instrumental rock of guitarist Patrick DeCoste. In the great tradition of Stevie Ray Vaughan and Jeff Beck, DeCoste combines virtuoso skills with rock and roll attitude to create his own unique sound. He\u2019s got the chops to play in the orchestra pit for the Grammy-winning musical HAIRSPRAY, and the swagger to play his own original interpretation of the Star Spangled Banner at Shea Stadium. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thebostoncalendar.com\/events\/four-guitarists-one-night\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.thebostoncalendar.com\/events\/four-guitarists-one-night<\/a><\/p>",

We offer routes which travel scenic back roads of Concord, Acton, Carlisle, and Bedford, and even include a lemonade stand. The long ride will also visit scenic Boxborough and Littleton.<\/p> <p>This is the arrow to follow for the ride:<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThis is a re-occuring ride every Sunday beginning in April, with the organized and marked rides of CRW (Charles River Wheelmen). The picture above is from one of last years rides. Don't let the # of RSVPs here fool you, these rides are always well atended usually with over 25 riders of all abilities.<\/p> <p>The distances\u00a0and routes vary every week. We'll have \"No Drop Rule\" so you won't have to worry about getting lost or keeping up. Ride with us if you ride anywhere from 15 to 20 MPH.<\/p> <p>Always bring two spare tubes, and your preferred hydration and nutrition. We don't typically stop for lunch but depending on the ride, there are sometimes options to stop for a bit. Before riding it's good practice to get your bike tuned. Remember to dress for the elements.<\/p> <p>Also CRW organizes a <a href=\"http:\/\/crw.org\/century.php?event=s\">Spring Century<\/a>, a Summer Century called <a href=\"http:\/\/crw.org\/CTTC\/climb2clouds.php\">Climb to the Clouds<\/a>, and a <a href=\"http:\/\/crw.org\/century.php?event=f\">Fall Century<\/a>. All of the Centuries have organized food and water stops. I'm hoping to get a group committed to building up to these Century rides.<\/p>",

Founded by\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/newenglandopenmarkets.com\/interview-sowa-open-market-founder-chris-masci\/\">Chris Masci and NE Open Markets, LLC<\/a>. The Market continues to grow, now filling three parking lots at 460, 500 and 540 Harrison Ave, showcasing vendors from all over New England and beyond. The SoWa Open Market, the SoWa Vintage Market, SoWa Food Truck Court and the SoWa Farmers Market. Together, these five weekly markets make SoWa Sundays!<\/p> <p>SoWa\u00a0is the cultural district in Boston located\u00a0South of\u00a0Washington Street, which is where it gets its name.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/a\/b\/8\/600_386495512.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>SoWa Food Trucks<\/p> <p>\u00a0Sunday there is a fantastic event in the Boston South End. The SoWa Open Market. I will be leading a workshop on the spot to discover secrets of how to photograph festivals and events. Some topics we will cover: How to take action shots, how to cut out clutter, how to photograph food trucks, street scenes, \u00a0people and dogs. Composition is the key.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/4\/3\/6\/600_440837462.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Noticing the details Photo by previous workshop participant Vicky.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In this fun and educational event, you'll discover \u00a0techniques that improve every single photo you take from now on.

As the photographer, you need to hone your skill of isolating key elements and bringing our attention to one thing at a time using color composition, lighting etc. This makes a more powerful image. Then, several images in a sequence can add up to a photo essay that tells the story of the day.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/4\/5\/0\/600_440837488.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Photo by former workshop participant Charlene great use of shallow depth of field and composition.

These skills are perfect for travel photography, and for preparing for the summer ahead here in Boston where there will be special events, parades and block parties nearly every weekend from now on.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/4\/6\/0\/600_440837504.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Photo by former participant Jaimin in the artist market area.

Then the conversation often flows onto other related subjects, sometimes in smaller conversation groups around the table.<\/p> <p>If you have any ideas for meeting topics, please let any of the co-organizers know.

Those who have been in attendance will be put on an advanced track for the session.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nThis weeks session is wall tek, getting over, off and to walls.<\/p> <p><b>What if I've never done anything like Parkour before?\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>This class, Parkour 101, is a introductory level class. We will be focusing more on learning how to move our body, understand our limits and get a solid understanding of how to train safe rather than jumping straight into super-high level flips and jumps.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What if I'm a gymnast\/marine\/stuntman\/etc? I don't want to be bored.<\/b><\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement. It's very common to in the same class have one student working on perfecting their roll, and on the other side of the room have another student practicing very high-level acrobatics. They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/b><\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous. We accept cash or card day of.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Anything else?<\/b><\/p> <p>These jams will be run outdoors, and with existing architecture. While we won't be getting into anything crazy, injuries are to be expected. Scrapes happen. We will have first aid available, but make sure you are thinking clearly and in your limits before training!\u00a0<\/p> <p>I am available to answer all questions, but I hope to see a whole bunch of you out in a few weeks!!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Be sure to check us out on:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\"><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/7\/5\/600_437965461.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

We believe that healing can be channeled through thought to those who need it. This is a very calming experience, whether or not you choose to sit in a healing chair.\u00a0 We encourage you to send healing to your loved ones, our communities, and Mother Earth.<\/p> <p>The Lecture covers a variety of topics ranging from the History of Spiritualism to Inspired Insights. It also includes examples of how Spiritualism is a part of our lives on a daily basis.<\/p> <p>Mediumship, or Spirit Communication, is the part of the service where a medium proves that \"...the existence and personal identity of the individual continue after the change called death.\" The medium might be a member of our church or visiting from another the Spiritualist church in the community. We also have mediums from abroad stop in often. While there is only enough time during a service for a few people to receive messages from their deceased loved ones on the Higher side Side of Life, everyone present benefits by witnessing proof of the continuation of life.<\/p> <p>At the conclusion of the service everyone is invited to our social hour downstairs for coffee and conversation.\ufeff<\/p>",

A book of post-9\/11 Canada, <i>The Ever After of Ashwin Rao<\/i> demonstrates that violent politics are all-too-often homegrown in North America but ignored at our peril.<br\/>\u00a0In 2004, almost 20 years after the fatal bombing of an Air India flight from Vancouver, 2 suspects--finally--are on trial for the crime. Ashwin Rao, an Indian psychologist trained in Canada, comes back to do a \"study of comparative grief,\" interviewing people who lost loved one in the attack. What he neglects to mention is that he, too, had family members who died on the plane. Then, to his delight and fear, he becomes embroiled in the lives of one family caught in the undertow of the tragedy, and privy to their secrets. This surprising emotional connection sparks him to confront his own losses. <i>The Ever After of Ashwin Rao<\/i> imagines the lasting emotional and political consequences of a real-life act of terror, confronting what we might learn to live with and what we can live without.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>This is the regular meetup on Sundays at noon at Brooklyn Boulders in Somerville.\u00a0 Meet by the first table\/bench thing by the entrance.\u00a0 Hopefully we'll get a good variety of climbing interests coming so that everyone can follow their climbing passion!<\/p> <p>(Credit to Francesco Cardiello for the information below):<br\/>BKBS is the gorgeous, new, state-of-the-art climbing gym most convenient to those in the Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville area. Although pricier, it features 60+ feet toproping and lead climbing, a massive 22 x 140 foot bouldering wall (and there's still another upstairs), yoga &amp; fitness classes, a sauna, awesome water fountains that fill your water bottle, a retail store, lounge area, weight room, and a soon to open cafe! There's even a collaborative work space where you can study, work, and climb!<br\/>If you are looking for a partner or just want to get your climb on join us on Wednesdays for a fun time.<\/p> <p>FAQ:<\/p> <p>How do I get there? BKBS is conveniently located within a 10 minute walk of the Porter Square station. Walk down Somerville Avenue and turn right on Properzi way and head all the way down. It is also very bike accessible. If you drive, you can find the lot at 30 Dane St. It is located next to Artisans Asylum.<\/p> <p>Why should I do this meetup? Since BKBS is such a new community (opened in late July 2013) few people have developed regular climbing partners to train and climb with. This is a great opportunity to meet other climbers interested in BKBS. Climbing is an inherently social sport - to top rope and do lead, you need to meet people who are dedicated to climbing. The Wednesday meetup assures you'll meet a partner to regularly climb with. We are looking to expand to other nights in the future.<\/p> <p>What if I haven't climbed before? First off, don't be intimidated. Everyone started somewhere. If you have never belayed before, please make sure to take the Learn the Ropes class. More info can be found here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/<\/a>. If you have a working knowledge of how to belay, you will need to be belay certified before using the walls. Please flag down a BKBS employee and let them know you need to take a belay test. To pass such a test you will need to display how to tie a double figure eight knot with a fisherman's backup, safely belay a climber up a wall, catch them on a fall, and lower them to the ground safely.<\/p> <p>What equipment do I need? You will need at the bare minimum a harness and climbing shoes. Rentals are available. Grigri devices are provided at every station.<\/p> <p>What if I can come, but at a different time? Just let everyone know you want to climb at a different time and use the community to find a partner for those dates \/ times.<\/p> <p>These are the climbing rates:<\/p> <p>ADMISSION (Full day use, you can leave and come back!): Day Pass - $25 (Students $18)<br\/>10 Pack - $200 (Students $169)<\/p> <p>RENTALS: Shoes - $5<br\/>Harness - $5<br\/>Chalk Bag - $2<br\/>Full Gear Kit - $11<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>The race to be Number One has been called America's state religion. We've been trained not only to compete frantically, but to believe in the value of beating people -- and to help our children become winners. Research and experience, however, demonstrate that competition is actually destructive to self-esteem, poisonous to relationships, and counterproductive in terms of achievement -- at work and at school. The result is that everyone ultimately loses in the desperate race to win. If we as humanists are committed to the value of collaboration and community, then it's important to question assumptions about the value (or inevitability) of competition that are sometimes taken on faith even by those who prefer to rely on reason.<\/p> <p>Alfie Kohn is the author of 14 books about education, parenting, and human behavior. These include Punished by Rewards, The Myth of the Spoiled Child, The Brighter Side of Human Nature, and his first book, No Contest: The Case Against Competition. He has been described as the country's leading critic of competition, although he notes that there isn't much competition for that title. Kohn lectures to researchers, parents, teachers, and managers all over the world.

So let's check out this thriller starring Joel Edgerton, Rebecca Hall and Jason Bateman and see what all the fuss is about.<\/p> <p>There is a screening at 2:10 PM in the AMC Loews near Boston Common on Sunday. I plan to be in the lobby of the theater around 1:45 PM with a Meetup sign. Once the group is together and we all have our tickets and snacks, we can head up the escalators and check out the film.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Afterwards, if anybody is interested, we can go over to Back Deck on West Street for food, drinks, and discussion of the movie.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.backdeckboston.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.backdeckboston.com\/<\/a><\/p> <p>See you then.<\/p>",

If we get enough interest (6+) we can have two tables and bring other 18xx games into the mix. I've set the date as the 16th as it's the only day I'm sure I can make it. Early RSVPS are helpful (obviously not required).<\/p> <p>I really want to encourage people to come, including people new to 18xx and\/or GBCC. I'll be there early to teach (and I happen to think 18EU is more newbie - friendly than other 18xx games while still providing a lot of strategic flexibility).<\/p> <p>18xx games are railroad building and stock trading games with common core mechanics but also specific features for each. 18EU follows the history of rails in Europe as players begin with minor regional railroads that merge to form national (and finally international) corporations.<\/p> <p>--------------------------<\/p> <p>About 334 Mass Ave:<\/p> <p>When you arrive, press 999 on the intercom, so security can let you in. \u00a0Sign in with a picture id at security and tell them you're going to level A. \u00a0Take the elevator down to level A.\u00a0The community room is to the right of the laundry room.<\/p> <p>I suggest you take the T, if possible. \u00a0The Green E line Symphony stop is under the building or across the street; you can also exit other Green lines at Hynes. The Orange line Mass Ave stop is a block away. The #39 bus stops at Gainsborough and Huntington. The #1 and BU shuttle buses stop in front of the building.\u00a0<\/p>",

PLEASE look on the website each week for confirmation. THANKS!<\/p> <p><br\/>To get to the Meetup, take the RED LINE stop OUTBOUND TO ALEWIFE, and stop at PORTER SQ. Look down the street. There's Tavern in the Square! If you're driving, you can park on the street for free on Sundays!<\/p> <p>Anyone who loves ASL is welcome to come and be part of the fun! We want to warmly extend an invitation to Deaf people or others fluent\/skilled in the language (CODAs for example) to join our group.<\/p> <p>This is an easy-going, casual, ASL get-together to meet people who enjoy American Sign Language, who want to brush up on their signing skills, and want to learn more ASL by using it as often as possible.<\/p> <p>We strive to have a good time and communicate without using voices. If we need to, we draw or write what we don't know how to sign, and if lots of folks show up, we split up into small groups and mix and mingle, so we can actually see one another clearly, face-to-face and get a good conversation going.<\/p> <p>Don't be afraid or shy if you're not \"perfect\" at ASL, because being \"perfect\" is not the point of this group. No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.<\/p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again. This isn't an ASL class, since none of us are certified ASL teachers, so there's really <i>no<\/i> pressure or expectation--other than that we all use ASL to communicate. We all learn from one another!<\/p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL\/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language<\/i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs<\/i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!<\/p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged<\/i><\/b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating. We have lots of resources that we can suggest for learning ASL from a qualified teacher or authentic source, such as books, online classes, and local classes at various locations near Boston.<\/p> <p>If you can, \"officially\" RSVP, even if the RSVP is \"No,\" so that we know who is definitely going to come.<\/p> <p>It will be great to see folks!<\/p> <p>Erika and Jack<\/p>",

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup.

How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup. Therefore the number of RSVPs reflected here are NOT the total number of men or women registered.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups. Please note that many people opt NOT to RSVP through Meetup for privacy reasons.<\/i><\/b><\/p>",

Let's get together and talk about words and language. What's your favorite or most surprising etymology? Favorite new declaration by the OED that it's an official word now? Do <a href=\"http:\/\/grammar.about.com\/od\/grammarfaq\/f\/verbingfaq.htm\">verbing <\/a>and abusages like 'irregardless' drive you crazy? Who gets to define what's acceptable in language? Should we accept the role of lexicographer as 'reporter of usage', or should some defining sensibilities carry some kind of weight in how we speak and write? Is it really such a big deal so long as people know what one another are talking about, or do we lose something if we do not embrace tradition in language?<\/p> <p>To get us started, here's language historian Anne Curzan on what makes a word real:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/anne_curzan_what_makes_a_word_real\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/anne_curzan_what_makes_a_word_real\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/anne_curzan_what_makes_a_word_real<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>So get out your mental dictionaries and grammar books, and join us in a fun discussion about the intricacies, idiosyncrasies, and evolution of our language.<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there :)<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>NUTSHELL - every week\u00a0day, 12:15ish until 1:45ish, Cumnock Turf Fields\u00a0at Harvard Stadium, games of 4v4 up to 10v10 or larger depending on who shows, bring a white shirt and a dark\/colored shirt (but not a gray one), almost never canceled, read\u00a0below for more details before asking questions that are answered here, and read the comments for today's meetup to see if there is\u00a0anything important\u00a0about today.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\"><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT - Harvard Square is the closest T stop (red line). \u00a0Check Google Maps or other to find fastest way there from wherever you are.<\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY RIDE SHARE - a lot of players in this meetup come by car and are nice enough to offer rides to others. Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

Fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski.\"<\/p> <p>What is\u00a0The Big Lebowski, you say? Well, if you have to ask... not only is it one of the biggest and best cult movies of our time, but more importantly, this Coen Brothers classic is an outrageously insane comedy of bowling, confused identities, naked performance art, porn-obsessed nihilists, a sex offender named Jesus, and some unforgettable musical dream sequences - Oh, and some guy called \"The Dude.\"<\/p> <p>Our annual Big Lebowski Bowling Party has become one of our biggest Summer events! Not only do you get to see this fantastic film on the big screen, but we throw in plenty of pre-show festivities to really tie things together. There will be Lebowski trivia, a costume contest and of course bowling! We've collected a ton of Dude-themed prizes to hand out; so dust off your bathrobes, work on your Walter impressions, and come celebrate this cult sensation! (Just don't pee on our rugs, man.)<\/p> <p>Doesn't get better than this, John<\/p>",
