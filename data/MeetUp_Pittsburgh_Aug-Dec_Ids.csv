Contact MONDO ITALIANO at [masked]/Tel:[masked] The documentary and the Capodarco project will be presented by Film Director Luca Guardabascio. Father Franco Monterubbianesi is the Founder of the Capodarco Community a non-profit organization working since 1966 to promote and defend the dignity of marginalized people especially those wtih mental and physical disability. The organization promotes their social and employment integration.Since 1966 when he was a young priest Father Franco was inspired by a strong belief that he made his only one mission: we should not accept injustice. In a globalized world based on economic power and competitiveness marginalized people are victims of social and cultural exclusion. Father Franco now 83 years old has spent all his life promoting the affirmation of human social and cultural rights of people with disabilities.Today the young generations are the new marginalized people. Capodarco has deeply marked the Italian Welfare State promoting important National Legislation such as on school integration of disabled students or in more recent years on social agriculture. The Italian Law knows as Legge Basaglia that abolished Mental Hospitals was also inspired by the Capodarco example.""Capodarco: prima del futuro"" (Capodarco: Before the Future) is a documentary about the Capodarco Project. Directed by Luca Guardabascio the film involves Capodarco residents and their realities which represent the main aspect of Capodarco\'s ideas not only of the past and of the present but also of the future.

We will then get into as few vehicles as possible to get all people back to Appollo PA (Roaring Run Access) where the paddling will begin.

We will need one person who\'s vehicle is at the takeout in Freeport to go back to Roaring Run Access Point/ Appolo to get the (person who watched boats at the beginning)\'s vehicle. Others are free to leave when their boat are loaded as long as one person watches the remaining boat(s) from the people involved in the end shuttle. If only one other person besides me comes then we can go to Freeport and paddle a section of the Allegheny River out and back with no shuttle. This is also the plan if the river is running extremely high- (flooded) or low. We will pass through the communities of Appolo North Vandergrift Hyde Park Leechburg West Leechburg Schenley and take out in Freeport. On the way we\'ll pass under a walking bridge through wooded areas probably see a few trains running along the river and see the lights of the Allegheny Ludlum Bagdad plant. Sunset: 8:35pmCivil Twilight: 9:05pmNautical Twilight: 9:43pmAstronomical Twilight: 10:25pmMoonrise: 9:18pmMoonset: 7:39amDay length: 14h 20m Source: http://www.sunrisesunset.com/calendar.asp *Technically the full moon occurs on Friday but I do not know what my work schedule will be next month so I am posting this on Saturday to be on the safe side I think the put in at Roaring Run is a Fish and Boat Commission Launch and I believe the takeout at Freeport are not Fish and Boat Commission Ramps and do not require Fish and Boat Commission Stickers. http://fishandboat.com/county.htm I believe a lifejacket and whistle must be on board on all PA waterways. Please bring at least one light source for after sunset. Head lamps and flashlights aregood as are lights made for boats. Expect to use your light source for at least 1.5 hours. The completion time is my best guess (90% chance) that we will be finished loading boats and completing the return shuttle- probably earlier. Depending on the group &amp; current we may finish much sooner. I recommend bringing something to drink or a snack and an extra layer if it is going to be cold. bilge pumps paddle floats and othersafety equipment to get back in you boat are good to bring if you havethem. I don\'t plan to tip but it has happened unexpectedly and I wasglad to have my pump. It is also good to have a cell phone in a dry bagziplock or other water proof container just in case. In the event of rain(not storms) this trip will still go- but you may want a spray skirt to keepyour boat dry. A camera is nice but we may not get too many pictures in the dark- we can try. (I don\'t think we\'ll be in water that is very deep so it should be possible to push your boat to shore standing or get back in on the water if you tip) This trip will run unless there islightening or thunder at launch time (or storms are predicted on the radar) toarrive during the time we will be on the water. A low chance of stormsmay mean shortening the trip- or turning around if we hear thunder when on thewater. If the weather is questionable please call me at[masked] tosee whether the trip is still on. If the river is at flood stage orobviously unsafe due to recent torrential rains- this trip will becancelled or changed to the Allegheny River at Freeport. I will not be able to see the conditions until I arrive around 5:30PM but if you have doubts- please call otherwise a decision will have to be made based on what we see upon arrival.

Yet the future of this industry is the subject of a highly charged debate being aired on the streets in the press and at City Hall. Carriage operators say that horse-drawn carriages should stay because they are a cherished symbol of New York City that bring in tourist dollars. Animal rights activists say the industry should be banned because it s inhumane and unsafe. They believe Hollywood has romanticized horse-drawn carriages and claim that life on congested city streets is anything but romantic for nervous prey animals. As a result of three fatal accidents since 2006 and a bill introduced at City Hall to ban horse-drawn carriages from NYC the plight of the NYC carriage horses is now in the public eye more than ever before. But the public doesn t know much more than what they see on the streets and in the news. Through original footage taken with hidden cameras and interviews with carriage drivers veterinarians accident witnesses animal rights activists politicians tourists residents who live near the horses and people who have rescued NYC carriage horses from slaughter BLINDERS takes viewers behind the scenes to expose the truth behind the tradition,"Vegan Book Club... film edition!

We\'ll share food at five pm show the film at 6 and have a discussion afterwards. No charge! From the film\'s website: ""Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret is a groundbreaking feature-length environmental documentary following intrepid filmmaker Kip Andersen as he uncovers the most destructive industry facing the planet today and investigates why the world s leading environmental organizations are too afraid to talk about it. Animal agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation water consumption and pollution is responsible for more greenhouse gases than the transportation industry and is a primary driver of rainforest destruction species extinction habitat loss topsoil erosion ocean dead zones and virtually every other environmental ill. Yet it goes on almost entirely unchallenged. As Andersen approaches leaders in the environmental movement he increasingly uncovers what appears to be an intentional refusal to discuss the issue of animal agriculture while industry whistleblowers and watchdogs warn him of the risks to his freedom and even his life if he dares to persist.""",Vegan Potluck and Cowspiracy Screening371591,226033357,23883039,extraVEGANza Pgh,Pittsburgh, 1317 E Carson Street,-79.984566,40.429131,food-drink,Vegetarian; Vegan; Animal Rights; Alternative Medicine; ,Raw acai chia falooda vegan nog fermented green tea salad and more...

She's a TV writer and something's come up on her show; she has to stay in Los Angeles. She knows that Neal will be upset with her-Neal is always a little upset with Georgie-but she doesn't expect to him to pack up the kids and go without her. When her husband and the kids leave for the airport Georgie wonders if she's finally done it. If she's ruined everything. That night Georgie discovers a way to communicate with Neal in the past. It's not time travel not exactly but she feels like she's been given an opportunity to fix her marriage before it starts. . . . Is that what she's supposed to do?

On the heels of leaving yet another city Hannah moves back to her hometown of Los Angeles and takes up residence in her best friend Gabby s guestroom. Shortly after getting back to town Hannah goes out to a bar one night with Gabby and meets up with her high school boyfriend Ethan. Just after midnight Gabby asks Hannah if she s ready to go.

But twenty years later Heloise considers it a blessing to be a person who knows how to avoid attention. In the comfortable suburb where she lives she's just a mom the youngish widow with a forgettable job who somehow never misses a soccer game or a school play. In the state capitol she's the redheaded lobbyist with a good cause and a mediocre track record. But in discreet hotel rooms throughout the area she's the woman of your dreams if you can afford her hourly fee. For more than a decade Heloise has believed she is safe. She has created a rigidly compartmentalized life maintaining no real friendships trusting few confidantes. Only now her secret life a life she was forced to build after the legitimate world turned its back on her is under siege. Her once oblivious accountant is asking loaded questions. Her longtime protector is hinting at new mysterious dangers. Her employees can't be trusted. One county over another so-called suburban madam has been found dead in her car a suicide. Or is it? Nothing is as it seems as Heloise faces a midlife crisis with much higher stakes than most will ever know. And then she learns that her son's father might be released from prison which is problematic because he doesn't know he has a son. The killer and former pimp also doesn't realize that he's serving a life sentence because Heloise betrayed him. But he's clearly beginning to suspect that Heloise has been holding something back all these years. With no formal education no real family and no friends Heloise has to remake her life again. Disappearing will be the easy part. She's done it before and she can do it again. A new name and a new place aren't hard to come by if you know the right people.

From Amazon.com: Intersecting overlapping not-quite-what-they-seem lives. Jealousies and betrayals and wounded hearts. A haunting unease that clutches and won t let go. All this and more helps propel Paula Hawkins s addictive debut into a new stratum of the psychological thriller genre. At times I couldn t help but think: Hitchcockian. From the opening line the reader knows what they re in for: She s buried beneath a silver birch tree down towards the old train tracks But Hawkins teases out the mystery with a veteran s finesse. The girl on the train is Rachel who commutes into London and back each day rolling past the backyard of a happy-looking couple she names Jess and Jason. Then one day Rachel sees Jess kissing another man. The day after that Jess goes missing. The story is told from three character s not-to-be-trusted perspectives: Rachel who mourns the loss of her former life with the help of canned gin and tonics; Megan (aka Jess); and Anna Rachel s ex-husband s wife who happens to be Jess/Megan s neighbor. Rachel s voyeuristic yearning for the seemingly idyllic life of Jess and Jason lures her closer and closer to the investigation into Jess/Megan s disappearance and closer to a deeper understanding of who she really is. And who she isn t. This is a book to be devoured. -Neal Thompson Please ask at the host stand for the book club.

(hopefully!) Although this is more or less a presentation by no means is this a lecture. The more interaction the better. As the organizer of this group I wanted to create an atmosphere where people who have the heart to help raise money for the cause(s) they care about most could gather together with organizations in need of financial support in a social environment and share fundraising ideas and / or stories with one another. Being the president of a local branch of a national non profit organization I\'m looking forward to meeting others like myself and sharing what fundraising tools our branch uses. To be completely honest one of the methods we are about to implement is so exciting I can\'t wait to share it with everyone! The cost to our organization to use this method is nothing we can partner with other organizations (in fact the more organizations we partner with the more each organization will earn) and even the volunteers that actively participate in the campaign will earn money too! I know it may be a little hard to believe but there are socially responsible corporations out there that have programs designed to give a portion of their profits back to non profit organizations. You\'ll be surprised and excited about many of the programs and methods that exists! I can\'t wait to share some of them with you all. Please bring paper and pen to take notes.

Nowhere is the situation more desperate than in India where every 30 minutes one farmer deep in debt and unable to provide for his family commits suicide. It\'s an epidemic which has claimed over a quarter million lives. Following a U.S. complaint to the World Trade Organization India had to open its doors to foreign seed companies like the U.S.-based Monsanto. Now only genetically modified (GM) seeds for some major crops are available at the seed shops. The GM seeds are much more expensive; in addition to precious water they need additional fertilizers and insecticides and must be re-purchased every season. Large farms have prospered but the majority of farmers are now struggling to make a living off their land. Ram Krishna a cotton farmer at the epicenter of the suicide crisis region is struggling to keep his land. Manjusha the neighbors\' daughter is determined to overcome village traditions and become a journalist. Ram Krishna\'s plight becomes her first assignment. BITTER SEEDS raises critical questions about the human cost of genetically modified agriculture and the future of how we grow things. Bitter Seeds screens Sunday October 4th at 6 PM at Sanger Lecture Hall which is inside Coolidge Hall. Coolidge Hall is across the road from the Chapel.

Shuffled into the unforgiving bureaucracy of a men s shelter George seems destined to wind up as just another lost soul swallowed up by the system until he meets a gregarious down-and-out ex-jazzman (played by Broadway legend Ben Vereen) who inspires George to reconnect with his estranged daughter (Jena Malone).

Negroes with Guns revives the powerful words and actions of this legendary Black leader and restores him to his central place in the Black struggle for dignity and human rights.    Kathleen Cleaver Former Black Panther    Senior Lecturer and Research Fellow    Emory University School of Law SYNOPSIS: NEGROES WITH GUNS: Rob Williams and Black Power tells the dramatic story of the often-forgotten civil rights leader who urged African Americans to arm themselves against violent racists. In doing so Williams not only challenged the Klan-dominated establishment of his hometown of Monroe North Carolina he alienated the mainstream Civil Rights Movement which advocated peaceful resistance. Robert F. Williams was the forefather of the Black Power movement and broke dramatic new ground by internationalizing the African American struggle. Negroes with Guns is not only an electrifying look at an historically erased leader but also provides a thought-provoking examination of Black radicalism and resistance and serves as a launching pad for the study of Black liberation philosophies. Insightful interviews with historian Clayborne Carson biographer Timothy Tyson Julian Bond and a first person account by Mabel Williams Robert\'s wife bring the story to life.

His debut already includes a handful of elements familiar to fans of subsequent work: a deceptively spare style often branded minimalist ; actor Lee Kang-sheng as the silent and sullen Hsiao-kang; copious amounts of water whether pouring from the sky or bubbling up from a clogged drain; and enough urban anomie to ensure that even the subtle humor in evidence is tinged with pathos. The loosely structured plot involves Hsiao-kang a despondent cram school student who becomes obsessed with young petty thief Ah-tze after Ah-tze smashes the rearview mirror of a taxi driven by Hsiao-kang s father. Hsiao-kang stalks Ah-tze and his buddy Ah-ping as they hang out in the film s iconic arcade (featuring a telling poster of James Dean on the wall) and other locales around Taipei and ultimately takes his revenge. Neon God is a remarkably impressive first film that hints at the promise of its director: a talent confirmed by Tsai s equally stunning second feature Vive L Amour (Golden Lion Venice) and continuing to his most recent film Stray Dogs which ranked high on many best of lists last year. Though showing such diverse influences as the French New Wave Wong Kar-wai s early films and yes Rebel Without a Cause Tsai s film is most remarkable for introducing his startlingly unique vision to world cinema.

Considered the quintessential work of German Expressionist cinema it tells the story of an insane hypnotist (Werner Krauss) who uses a somnambulist (Conrad Veidt) to commit murders. The film features a dark and twisted visual style with sharp-pointed forms oblique and curving lines structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles and shadows and streaks of light painted directly onto the sets. Critic Roger Ebert called it arguably ""the first true horror film"" and film reviewer Danny Peary called it cinema\'s first cult film and a precursor for arthouse films. Considered a classic it helped draw worldwide attention to the artistic merit of German cinema and had a major influence on American films particularly in the genres of horror and film noir.

In 1921 Jimmy Gralton\'s sin was to build a dance hall on a rural crossroads in an Ireland on the brink of Civil War. The Pearse-Connolly Hall was a place where young people could come to learn to argue to dream...but above all to dance and have fun. As the hall grew in popularity its socialist and free-spirited reputation brought it to the attention of the church and politicians who forced Jimmy to flee and the hall to close.

Hollywood Reporter Synopsis (Courtesy of Firelight Media) \'Marcus Garvey: Look For Me In The Whirlwind\' uses a wealth of archival film photographs and documents to uncover the story of this Jamaican immigrant who between 1916 and 1921 built the largest black mass movement in world history. It explores Garvey s dramatic successes and failures before his fall into obscurity. Among the film s most powerful sequences are interviews with people who were part of the Garvey movement decades ago. These interviews communicate the appeal of Garvey s revolutionary ideas to a generation of African Americans and reveal how he invested hundreds and thousands of black men and women with a newfound sense of pride.,Marcus Garvey Film Screens in Honor of His Birthday741891,226250957,783159,Regent Square Theater,Pittsburgh, 1035 S Braddock Ave,-79.894225,40.433416,movies-film,Arthouse; Indie Films; Watching Movies; Documentary Films; Film; Independent Filmmaking; ,Klaus Kinski stars in one of the great haunting visions of the cinema leading a group of conquistadores as they descend into the heart of darkness while exploring the Amazon in search of El Dorado the legendary city of gold.

Carter Buzzfeed ""The film is equal parts exhaustive chronicle of the Panther\'s peak era and a loving paean to the culture of the late \'60s and early \'70s when social change was a big part of the zeitgeist."" -Martin Johnson The Root It s the kind of documentary that s easy to view as distant history except that so many of the issues the Panthers took up (police brutality systemic poverty healthcare feeding children) are sadly not history at all.

SYNOPSIS (Courtesy of theblackpanthers.com) Change was coming to America and the fault lines could no longer be ignored cities were burning Vietnam was exploding and disputes raged over equality and civil rights. A new revolutionary culture was emerging and it sought to drastically transform the system. The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense would for a short time put itself at the vanguard of that change. THE BLACK PANTHERS: VANGUARD OF THE REVOLUTION is the first feature length documentary to explore the Black Panther Party its significance to the broader American culture its cultural and political awakening for black people and the painful lessons wrought when a movement derails. Master documentarian Stanley Nelson goes straight to the source weaving a treasure trove of rare archival footage with the voices of the people who were there: police FBI informants journalists white supporters and detractors and Black Panthers who remained loyal to the party and those who left it. Featuring Kathleen Cleaver Jamal Joseph and many others THE BLACK PANTHERS: VANGUARD OF THE REVOLUTION is an essential history and a vibrant chronicle of this pivotal movement that birthed a new revolutionary culture in America.

Each stands on its own. at 5:45 Aparajito (The Unvanquished) Satyajit Ray had not planned to make a sequel to Pather Panchali but after the film s international success he decided to continue Apu s narrative. Aparajito picks up where the first film leaves off with Apu and his family having moved away from the country to live in the bustling holy city of Varanasi (then known as Benares). As Apu progresses from wide-eyed child to intellectually curious teenager eventually studying in Kolkata we witness his academic and moral education as well as the growing complexity of his relationship with his mother. This tenderly expressive often heart-wrenching film which won three top prizes at the Venice Film Festival including the Golden Lion not only extends but also spiritually deepens the tale of Apu. Part of The Apu Trilogy series. Satyajit Ray || India || 1956 || 109 min. At 8PM Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) By the time Apur Sansar was released Satyajit Ray had directed not only the first two Apu films but also the masterpiece The Music Room and was well on his way to becoming a legend. This extraordinary final chapter brings our protagonist s journey full circle. Apu is now in his early twenties out of college and hoping to live as a writer. Alongside his professional ambitions the film charts his romantic awakening which occurs as the result of a most unlikely turn of events and his eventual fraught fatherhood. Featuring soon to be Ray regulars Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore in star-making performances and demonstrating Ray s ever-more-impressive skills as a crafter of pure cinematic imagery Apur Sansar is a breathtaking conclusion to this monumental trilogy.

We are establishing administrations for common law grand juries in all 3144 counties in the United States of America. By doing this the people will move our courts back to Courts of Justice and take back 100% control of their government. THE DUTY OF THE COMMON LAW GRAND JURY is to right any wrong. If anyone s unalienable rights have been violated or removed without a legal sentence of their peers the grand jury can restore them. And if a dispute shall arise concerning this matter it shall be settled according to the judgment of the grand jurors the sureties of the peace. IN A US SUPREME COURT STUNNING 6 TO 3 DECISION JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA writing for the majority confirmed that the American grand jury is neither part of the judicial executive nor legislative branches of government but instead belongs to the people. It is in effect a fourth branch of government ""governed"" and administered to directly by and on behalf of the American people and its authority emanates from the Bill of Rights and has the power to enforce law and remove people from office. GRAND JURY BACKGROUND When the American colonies separated from England King George retaliated by revoking the charters. Technically the colonies were without any legal authority to operate. However civics (the branch of political philosophy concerned with individual rights) was generally taught and known by the people who asserted their rights and maintained order by applying the common law. The people united in the form of common law grand juries and continued the functioning of government. As the legislatures matured they slowly increased governmental power while simultaneously reducing personal sovereign power. This was done through a combination of passing pro-government legislation and reducing or eliminating education about civics. Today two and a quarter centuries later hardly anyone even knows the meaning of the word ""civics."" Despite the fact that the state and federal constitutions still acknowledge the common law as the ultimate law system people everywhere are conditioned to believe that the statutory law and codes are the only source of law. The only remaining common law term generally known among the public is ""common law marriage."" The common law grand jury is now dormant only because of the public ignorance of its powers that supersede all other government entities including the modern statutorily defined grand jury.

If you ignore the whistle and show up late to the next bar or without a nametag you may not get the special and you may have to pay the cover to get in. You can get nametags at the first 3 bars. 5. You are responsible for your behavior. If you get drunk it is your own fault not our fault and not the bar\'s. Take a cab home.(We reccommend Classy Cab or UBERX I like going home in a Limo). 6. You are also responsible for the people you invite. If you know someone is a nasty or problem drunk do not invite him..her. The pub-crawl is not the place for him/her to display his/her talents. If you cause a problem you will be asked to leave and so will the person who invited you. We have a good reputation.,Halloween Pub Crawl 2015! ALL Mt.

Please note that there will be a tour of the church beginning at 6:15 PM before the 7 PM Mass (which should be about an hour long) which will then be followed by a light reception. As a reminder it is important to recognize that while everyone may have different religious beliefs we should also try to be respectful and welcoming and realize that we can sometimes have a tendency to overlook historical things in our own region. As always it is also fine if you wish to attend on your own with family/friends instead. Pittsburgh Mass Mob is a group that enjoys going to different churches which have historical significance in terms of architecture rich ethnic/cultural tradition etc. Typically 30-80 from the Pittsburgh Mass Mob group visit a different church which is selected each month. Of note is that their are similar Mass Mob groups all across the country where visitors are struck by what they experience with comments such as It s like walking back in history. So please feel free to join the Carlow University Campus Ministry the Sisters of Mercy and the leadership of the Carlow University in a joyous celebration of the Eucharist in the former Saint Agnes Church (1917). This parish was formed in 1868 for the growing Oakland community between downtown and the Strip District to the west and East Liberty to the east. St. Agnes served the parish for 75 years until it was sold to the Sisters of Mercy at Carlow University. St. Agnes church was designed by the famous Pittsburgh architect John Theodore Comes. It is designed in the Lombardy style that was copied from churches in France and Spain. This tapestry brick stone and concrete edifice sits at the top of the long Fifth Avenue descent into Pittsburgh. The stained glass windows designed by Pittsburgh designer George W. Sotter and the richly painted murals painted by Cincinnati native Felix B. Lieftuchter are breathtaking. The high altar side altars communion rail and baptistery are executed in creamy marble with mosaic inlay accents by New York sculptor Henry Schmitt. Look at the unique and detailed fa ade of the church. The central wheel window has a Calvary group sculpted into it! And the tympanum over all three entrance doors is exquisitely detailed. All this work is the hand of Francis (Frank) Aretz. His medium is cast concrete rather than stone! Amazing. Every aspect of this church indicates the fine degree of craftsmanship and artistry offered for a House of God. You will want to get here early and linger over the rich detail that abounds this holy place! For a time it was also the location of the Latin (Tridentine) Mass before the diocese closure. Please note that a tour of the architectural detail of the church will follow the Mass. A reception will also follow the Mass at the back of the church. Did you know that the very first convent of the Sisters of Mercy in the United States was found in Pittsburgh on December 21 1843? And how this would eventually lead to the founding of Carlow University? About the Sisters of Mercy and founding of Carlow University With this visit we'll also learn about the historical and architectural significance of St. Agnes (which began as a parish church in 1917) as well as the founding itself of Carlow University (which was originally Mount Mercy College in 1929) and the pivotal underlying role of the very first Sisters of Mercy who arrived in the U.S. from Ireland in 1843 at the invitation of the Bishop Michael O'Connor of Pittsburgh. The Sisters of Mercy were founded in 1831 in Dublin Ireland by Catherine McAuley a woman who sought through her service to the poor the sick and the uneducated to reveal the mercy of God in our world. Catherine s particular concern for women manifested itself in her efforts to help women to recognize their inherent dignity to become self-directing and self-sustaining. Education was at the heart of this effort as was a desire to meet needs not being addressed by others. When the Sisters of Mercy arrived in Pittsburgh in 1843 their first ministries arose from the needs presented by this burgeoning city education and health care. Saint Mary s Academy and the Mercy Hospital of Pittsburgh (now UPMC Mercy) were established within two years of their arrival. In the late 1920s another need presented itself the lack of baccalaureate level education for the Catholic women of the city. After consultation with the bishop and the heads of the already existing institutions of higher learning the Sisters of Mercy founded Mount Mercy College (now Carlow University) on September 24 1929. Thus with this event we'll be celebrating mass at St. Agnes while also recognizing both the founding of Carlow University and founding of the Sisters of Mercy in the U.S. and all right here in Pittsburgh! As we think back to 1843 and the leader of the first Sisters of Mercy group Mother Frances Warde who remained in Pittsburgh for seven years and then set out to found 100 convents hospitals schools and social service agencies. Her biographer says that no woman has lived to whom the Church in the U.S. owes more than it does her . Though she was only in Pittsburgh for seven years when the city celebrated its bi-centennial the Western Pennsylvania Historical Society named her one of the 10 most influential women in the history of the city. Ample Parking is located at two adjacent lots to the left and right of the church along Fifth Avenue and Robinson Street. One restroom is located in the church vestibule (not ADA compliant). However please note that there is not an ADA entrance available to this church (a few steps enter into the priests sacristy side door). Carlow University http://www.carlow.edu/ To learn more about the history of the Sisters of Mercy please visit http://www.sistersofmercy.org/about-us/our-history/ And here is an interesting article from the Post Gazette discussing the history/chronology of the Sisters of Mercy as well as Mercy Hospital http://www.post-gazette.com/business/businessnews/2006/09/21/UPMC-Mercy-A-chronology/stories/200609210367 Greetings to everyone ... Just to let you know there will be a pre-Mass tour of St. Agnes at 6:15 this Sunday given by our own historian David. Please join us and be sure to bring your cameras for this rare opportunity to experience the beauty and majesty of this church yourself. Be sure to take pictures of the murals behind the altar truly majestic. You can see some of them in the video that I made of St. Agnes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-ZYK-j1JlE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-ZYK-j1JlE There will be a light reception immediately following the Mass in the back of St. Agnes. Since it is a school night they will be closing the church around 8:30 PM and so that is why they have asked us to hold the tour before 7:00 PM. Thank you to those of you that have signed up. If you know of anyone that attended St. Agnes as a child if you could let them know about this opportunity to go to church there again please feel free to pass this information on to them.

""Nabucco"" is Verdi\'s third opera which is considered to have permanently established Verdi\'s reputation as a composer. Verdi commented that ""this is the opera with which my artistic career really begins. And though I had many difficulties to fight against it is certain that Nabucco was born under a lucky star"". This opera follows the plight of the Jews as they are assaulted conquered and subsequently exiled from their homeland by the Babylonian King Nabucco (in English Nebuchadnezzar II). The opera is set in 587 BC where historical events are used as background for a romantic and political plot. The best-known number from the opera is the ""Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves"" Va pensiero sull\'ali dorate / ""Fly thought on golden wings"" a chorus which is regularly given an encore in many opera houses when performed today. What makes ""Nabucco"" LARGER THAN LIFE? The chills you\'ll get when Mark Delavan (who\'s sung previously here in Pittsburgh as Falstaff Rigoletto and Scarpia) portrays the troubled monarch who takes both his daughters to war with him one daughter gentle Fenena is captured by the Hebrews only to be freed by her Hebrew lover (Ismaele nephew of the King of Jerusalem) while the other daughter Abigaille is consumed by ambition frustration (she wants Ismaele) and rage against anything in her way including her father. The epic story of the Jews in exile in Babylon. The impressive and affecting projections that accompany this big traditional production. That most beloved of choruses ""Va pensiero."" The poignant family story of betrayal and reconciliation at the heart of the opera.

This show takes place at the outdoor stage near the corner of Liberty Avenue &amp; Taylor Street at one end of the festival about 3 blocks from the Pittsburgh Dance Center. FYI here is the Little Italy Days entertainment line-up http://littleitalydays.com/2015-entertainment/ Please know it is also OK if you\'d like to RSVP only for the free Little Italy Days portion of this event. The group could meet at 5 PM and check out the rest of the festival until 7 PM or so. But for those that are interested we\'ll also have a chance to dance off some calories as we continue the \'Dance Lesson Wine Session\' series at the Pittsburgh Dance Center located in the heart of Bloomfield near the Little Italy Days festival. And to make this edition that much more fun and special we\'ll also be learning some dances to Italian music with songs from Dean Martin Frank Sinatra Louis Prima and Andrea Bocelli while enjoying Italian wines and pastries! The fun ballroom dance lessons will be suitable for beginners with all levels welcome. The doors will open around 6:00 PM so we\'ll have a bit more time for socializing before the first lesson begins. The dance class is only $10 which also includes complimentary pastries and lite snacks although some of us may not be as hungry after taking in Little Italy Days. As a reminder this event is BYOwine Italian wines suggested! With so many people in the Meetup sometimes it can be challenge meeting/mingling especially for relatively new members when attending other events at busy art galleries outdoor festivals and performances at large venues such as the Benedum. So perhaps a series of fun activities that bring lots of people together would also help with introductions and spotting other members at future events. In terms of the Meetup for the Little Italy Days portion of the event there are several options although everyone is encouraged to arrive as early as possible to enjoy all the festivities including live music and great street food. Please gather at the Pittsburgh Dance Center (4765 Liberty Ave above Starbucks) at 5 PM where you can drop off the wines and then the group can walk around to check out Little Italy Days. We hope to see everyone back at the studio at 6-6:30 PM to enjoy some wine/pastries and then we will get the party started with a Foxtrot class at 7 PM! After the first 45-minute lesson people will have the option to continue dancing until 9:30 PM or simply enjoy some Italian wines snacks good conversation and lots of laughs. And there will even be a second 45-minute class for those that are interested!! This will be a fantastic event bringing people together Meetup groups PDC clients and others from the community that may also stop by after Little Italy Days. In addition to the usual dance lessons people expect (salsa rhumba etc.) just wait until we learn some dances to Italian music with familiar songs from Dean Martin Frank Sinatra Andrea Boccelli Louis Prima etc. while enjoying Italian wines! While Pittsburgh has a vibrant cultural scene including classical and contemporary dance this is our chance to experience being a bit more than spectators while learning more about the art of dance. Unlike a restaurant where people spend most of the time talking with those seated nearby the \'Dance Lesson Wine Lesson\' will be less formal so people should be able to meet many others while enjoying the group dance lesson and sharing pizza/wine. While there are other Meetup groups and organizations in the region that are specifically focused on dance this event is also an opportunity for people to see if they might enjoy taking up dance in a relaxed informal atmosphere. Because some might be more comfortable bringing a friend for the dance lesson guests are certainly welcome. So when you RSVP please indicate if you\'ll bringing one or more friends. This event costs only $10/person please bring cash at the door and is BYOB wine. The $10 includes complimentary pastries and snacks. What a great deal! But to make the wine appreciation session more interesting please feel free to bring either your favorite bottle of wine or something you\'ve never tried before which costs less than $15/bottle. Italian wine is suggested for this event although there will also be local Pennsylvania wineries participating at Little Italy Days for wine tastings/purchases and so you could also bring a bottle back to the dance studio. For those that live close to the larger state stores this might be a chance to check out one of the Chairmen\'s Selection wines. It would be fantastic if this event included a variety of white and red wines representing different regions of Italy for the group to try. And if you don\'t drink that is certainly OK as this event is about having fun bringing people together and learning a little more about ballroom dance. To enhance this event it would be great if those that were interested in arriving a bit earlier on Sunday afternoon August 23 to Little Italy Days could post some comments. Perhaps a group could be organized to check out even more of the festival or having a dinner before the dance lesson. Also please let us know if you have any preferences on the dance lesson (in addition to the dances for Italian music) We hope to see everyone on Sunday August 23!

Please note that there will be a tour of the church immediately following Mass (which is usually less than an hour long) As a reminder it is important to recognize that while everyone may have different religious beliefs we should also try to be respectful and welcoming and realize that we can sometimes have a tendency to overlook historical things in our own region. As always it is also fine if you wish to attend on your own with family/friends instead. Pittsburgh Mass Mob is a group that enjoys going to different churches which have historical significance in terms of architecture rich ethnic/cultural tradition etc. Typically 30-80 from the Pittsburgh Mass Mob group visit a different church which is selected each month. Of note is that their are similar Mass Mob groups all across the country where visitors are struck by what they experience with comments such as It s like walking back in history. Brother John Harvey has graciously invited the Pittsburgh Mass Mob to visit the gorgeous historic Saint Augustine Catholic Church (which is also known as Our Lady of Angels Parish) in the Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh. The church\'s Romanesque style was designed by architect John T. Comes [masked]) for the firm Rutan and Russell. Comes also designed Saint John the Baptist Church also in Lawrenceville for the Beezer Brothers architectural firm. Construction for St. Augustine Church began in September of 1899 and was dedicated on May 21 1901. The beautiful stained glass windows are also wonderful pieces of history. They were imported from Munich Germany. The parish has been operated by the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor Capuchin (OFM Cap) since the 1870s when there was a call for German speaking priests put out by Bishop Domenec early in the history of the Diocese of Pittsburgh. Our Lady of the Angels was established in 1993 as part of the diocese\'s reorganization and revitalization project in part driven by declining populations in various neighborhoods. The parish was formed by the merger of St. Augustine Holy Family St. John the Baptist and St. Mary. Of the four churches St. John the Baptist was sold shortly after the merger. The remaining three churches at first remained open. However after a few years the parish determined that the congregation could not support three church buildings. St. Mary Church closed in November of 2004. Holy Family Church closed on Dec. 28 2008. St. Augustine Church remains open and continues to serve the parish. There will be a tour of the church immediately following Mass. For more information on the history of Saint Augustine Catholic Church please visit http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~njm1/StAugJub3.html We can\'t wait for you to witness the beauty of this exquisite example of German Romanesque Catholic Churches in Pittsburgh! Bring your cameras invite family friends and neighbors to help rediscover another one of Pittsburgh\'s hidden gems that deserves to be a part of our vibrant community once more!

This has been a fun series and I hope to see those of you that have become regulars as well as all of you that have wanted to try but just haven't made it yet! And this time we'll have something else to celebrate which is the birthday of the Pittsburgh Dance Center! So please join us for some fun dance lessons wine conversation door prizes and of course birthday cake! The fun ballroom dance lessons will be suitable for beginners with all levels welcome. The doors will open around 7:00 PM so we'll have a bit more time for socializing before the first lesson begins. The dance class is only $10 which also includes complimentary light food/refreshments. As a reminder this event is BYOwine which has been so popular in the past as guests have a chance to try so many different wines! With so many people in the Meetup sometimes it can be challenge meeting/mingling especially for relatively new members when attending other events at busy art galleries outdoor festivals and performances at large venues such as the Benedum. So perhaps a series of fun activities that bring lots of people together would also help with introductions and spotting other members at future events. After the socializing period we will have the first salsa class lesson around 7:30 PM. After the first 45-minute lesson people will have the option to continue dancing until around 10:30 PM or simply enjoy more wines snacks good conversation and lots of laughs. And there will even be a second 45-minute class for those that are interested!! This will be a fantastic event bringing people together Meetup groups PDC clients and dance enthusiasts. This 'Dance Lesson Wine Session' series has been a lot of fun (for those that may have attended the earlier Meetup events during 2014 and 2015) and so having it this time in celebration of the PDC birthday is sure to be a great time for everyone. While Pittsburgh has a vibrant cultural scene including classical and contemporary dance this is our chance to experience being a bit more than spectators while learning more about the art of dance. Unlike a restaurant where people spend most of the time talking with those seated nearby the 'Dance Lesson Wine Lesson' will be less formal so people should be able to meet many others while enjoying the group dance lesson and sharing wine. While there are other Meetup groups and organizations in the region that are specifically focused on dance this event is also an opportunity for people to see if they might enjoy taking up dance in a relaxed informal atmosphere. Because some might be more comfortable bringing a friend for the dance lesson guests are certainly welcome. So when you RSVP please indicate if you'll bringing one or more friends. This event costs only $10/person please bring cash at the door and is BYOB wine. The $10 includes complimentary snacks and birthday cake. But to make the wine appreciation session more interesting please feel free to bring either your favorite bottle of wine or something you've never tried before with an emphasis on value wines in the $6-$12/bottle range. For those that live close to the larger state stores this might be a chance to check out one of the Chairmen's Selection wines. It would be fantastic if this event included a variety of white and red wines for the group to try. And if you don't drink that is certainly OK as this event is about having fun bringing people together and learning a little more about ballroom dance. Also please let us know if you have any preferences on the dance lesson (salsa swing tango etc.) by posting some comments. We hope to see everyone on Friday October 23!

As a reminder it is important to recognize that while everyone may have different religious beliefs we should also try to be respectful and welcoming and realize that we can sometimes have a tendency to overlook historical things in our own region. As always it is also fine if you wish to attend on your own with family/friends instead. Pittsburgh Mass Mob is a group that enjoys going to different churches which have historical significance in terms of architecture rich ethnic/cultural tradition etc. Typically 30-80 people from the Pittsburgh Mass Mob group visit a different church which is selected each month. Of note is that their are similar Mass Mob groups all across the country where visitors are struck by what they experience with comments such as It s like walking back in history. So please feel free to join the Pittsburgh Mass Mob and Father Terry O'Connor (and son of the late Bob O'Connor beloved Pittsburgh Mayor) who has graciously invited the group to be a part of their Faith Community and help them celebrate their parish's patron saint Saint Therese of Lisieux on October 4 2015 at their 11:00 am Sunday Mass. October 3 1925 the parish of St. Therese of Lisieux was established by Father Joseph D. Hagan. Plans to build a church were halted due to the crash of 1929. After World War II and the revival of the steel plants work once again began in earnest towards the creation of this beautiful church and school. St. Therese of Lisieux School was blessed on August 21 1954. Mass was first celebrated in the basement of this new school until St. Therese of Lisieux Church was finally completed and put into faithful service beginning in 1958. St. Therese of Lisieux Church is a beautiful church with many unique elements that add to the charm of this House of Worship. It contains a unique chapel dedicated to this beloved saint who is called The Little Flower of Jesus . It contains both first and second class relics of this doctor of the Catholic Church made famous in part by her best-selling autobiography The Story of a Soul . It also contains distinct stained glass windows that lovingly tell the stories from both the Old and New Testaments as well as pageants of Pittsburgh scenes honoring the lives of some of the hardworking people that helped make our city what she is today. Just recently St. Therese's church made the news when one of it's bells was repaired and reinstalled. If you would like to see the video honoring this event the link is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGkl-cAqD-Q As you can tell from this video this is truly a fun-loving Faith community! For more information about St. Therese of Lisieux Parish please visit http://www.st-therese.net/ The reason that Father O'Connor and Pittsburgh Mass Mob chose this date is that this is the Sunday when St. Therese of Lisieux's church celebrates the feast day of their patron saint by finishing their nine-day novena to her as well as hosting a procession outside the church in honor of her. We will be able to partake in this joyous celebration a first for Pittsburgh Mass Mob! Please invite family and friends for this special day. You don't want to miss this one!

The musical was nominated for eleven Tony awards winning six including for Best Orchestration and Best Original Score. It ran for 504 performances on Broadway in 2005-2006. ""The Light in the Piazza"" tells the poignant story of Margaret Johnson a wealthy Southern woman and her beautiful daughter Clara as they tour Italy and the Tuscan countryside during the summer of 1953. While sightseeing Clara loses her hat to a sudden gust of wind. As if guided by an unseen hand her hat lands at the feet of Fabrizio Naccarelli a handsome young Florentine man who returns it to Clara. This brief episode charged with coincidence and fate sparks an immediate and intense romance between Clara and Fabrizio. Margaret extremely protective of her daughter attempts to keep Clara and Fabrizio apart as we learn of Clara s secret. Unable to suppress the truth about her daughter Margaret is forced to reconsider not only Clara\'s future but her own deep seated hopes and regrets as well. As Tony Award winner for Best Original Score Adam Guettel s score breaks from the 21st century tradition of pop music on Broadway with unexpected harmonic shifts and extended melodic structures.

This fun evening will start off with an appetizer sampling created by Chef Josh Ross of the newly opened Pan Asian (which is located in the former Tamari space) in Lawrenceville. If you haven't been to Pan Asian check out this great review from City Paper http://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/pan-asian-kitchen/Content?oid=1849831 And the Pan Asian website http://www.panasianpgh.com/ Check out the menu that Chef Josh will create for our Dance Lesson Wine Session event! Tempura sweet potato mango avocado maki with smoked habanero mango puree Tempura jalapeno cream cheese cucumber maki with jalapeno miso Pickled vegetable seaweed salad cucumber maki with truffle soy Roasted edamame salad with sesame miso vinagrette. Chef Josh may change or add to it but this gives you a general idea for pairing wine and so we would recommend an effervescent white spicy or smokey red or sake. This is a light enough selection that you will feel energetic and ready to dance after! The introductory class in tango will begin at 6:30 PM which will be followed by a break so the group may enjoy more food/wine and socializing. The evening will then continue with general dancing including Latin and ballroom mini-lessons depending on the interests of the group. This event is BYOwine and it is suggested you bring one of your favorite wines or perhaps something you've never tried before. And this time we'll have something else to celebrate namely NATIONAL BALLROOM DANCE WEEK taking place during September 18-27 2015. The fun dance lessons will be suitable for beginners with all levels welcome. The doors will open around 6:30 PM so we'll have a bit more time for socializing before the first lesson begins. The dance class is only $15 which also includes complimentary appetizer sampling created by Chef Josh Ross of Pan Asian plus a complimentary 'follow up' beginner dance class voucher for your use after this event. What a great deal!! As a reminder this event is BYOwine which has been so popular in the past as guests have a chance to try so many different wines! Please wear something fun and comfortable such as dressy casual to cocktail wear! With so many people in the Meetup sometimes it can be challenge meeting/mingling especially for relatively new members when attending other events at busy art galleries outdoor festivals and performances at large venues such as the Benedum. So perhaps a series of fun activities that bring lots of people together would also help with introductions and spotting other members at future events. After the first 45-minute lesson people will have the option to continue dancing until around 9:30-10 PM or simply enjoy more wines snacks good conversation and lots of laughs. And there will even be mini-class lessons to some of your favorite beats for those that are interested!! This will be a fantastic event bringing people together Meetup groups PDC clients and dance enthusiasts. This 'Dance Lesson Wine Session' series has been a lot of fun so having it this time in celebration of NATIONAL BALLROOM DANCE WEEK should be a great time for everyone. While Pittsburgh has a vibrant cultural scene including classical and contemporary dance this is our chance to experience being a bit more than spectators while learning more about the art of dance. Unlike a restaurant where people spend most of the time talking with those seated nearby the 'Dance Lesson Wine Lesson' will be less formal so people should be able to meet many others while enjoying the group dance lesson and sharing wine. While there are other Meetup groups and organizations in the region that are specifically focused on dance this event is also an opportunity for people to see if they might enjoy taking up dance in a relaxed informal atmosphere. Because some might be more comfortable bringing a friend for the dance lesson guests are certainly welcome. So when you RSVP please indicate if you'll bringing one or more friends. This event costs only $15/person please bring cash at the door and is BYOB wine. The $15 includes complimentary appetizer sampling created by Executive Chef Josh Ross of Pan plus a complimentary 'follow up' beginner class voucher for your use at PDC after this event. What a great deal!!! But to make the wine appreciation session more interesting please feel free to bring one of your favorite bottles of wine or perhaps something you've never tried before with an emphasis on value wines in the $12/bottle range. With the great appetizer menu prepared by Chef Josh we would also recommend an effervescent white spicy or smokey red or sake. For those that live close to the larger state stores this might be a chance to check out one of the Chairmen's Selection wines. It would be fantastic if this event included a variety of wines for the group to try. And if you don't drink that is certainly OK as this event is about having fun bringing lots of people together and learning a little more about ballroom dance. We hope to see everyone on Sunday September 27!

This film is set in 9th century China (during the Tang Dynasty) and stars actress Shu Qi in the role of Nie Yinniang who has been appointed to slay corrupt government officials by her master Jiaxin a nun who raised her from the age of ten. However when Yinniang displays mercy by failing to kill during her duties Jiaxing punishes her with a ruthless assignment designed to test Yinniang s resolve.

Thus she must confront her parents her memories and her long-repressed feelings in a choice to sacrifice the man she loves or break forever with the sacred way of the righteous assassins. The film is loosely adapted from the late 9th century martial arts story ""Nie Yinniang"" by Pei Xing a core text in Chinese swordsmanship and wuxia fiction. ""The Assassin"" was an official selection in the main competition section at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival where Hou won the award for Best Director.

What started out as a neighborhood street fair is now regarded as one of the top shows in our region. The complete schedule of artists and activities will probably be announced sometime during late Spring or early summer and then we'll plan some specific Meetup opportunities to check out artist booths. For more information on the Shadyside Art Festival festival please visit http://www.artfestival.com/Festivals/Shadyside_The_Art_Festival_on_Walnut_Street_Pittsburgh_Pennsylvania_August.ASPX MEETUP Considerations Since the weekend forecast is looking pretty good we'll arrange Meetup groups for both Saturday and Sunday afternoon. As always it is also fine if people prefer to check out the festival on their own (with family/friends) or in smaller groups. One gathering location is at Brueggers (corner of S. Aiken and Walnut) on Saturday August 29 from 2:30-3 PM and 4:30-5 PM and Sunday August 30 from 3-3:30 PM. We'd also like to give members a few more options. While some may spend only an hour or two at the festival others will stay longer or may want to have lunch or dinner or go shopping along Walnut Street. When you RSVP please indicate if you might also like to consider a lunch/dinner at a local Shadyside restaurant so we may be able to adjust the meeting times. We can also post additional locations/times so members have a chance to meet/mingle depending on when they arrive and how long they decide to stay at the festival. Parking While there is a Pittsburgh Parking Authority garage in Shadyside which charges fairly reasonable rates ($3-$10 depending on how long one stays) the garage may be busy and thus many people visiting Shadyside Arts Festival opt for street parking and then just walk as there are many side streets in this neighborhood. But if you want to try swinging by the garage it is located at 714 Bellefonte Street (a short distance off Walnut Street) or call[masked] or visit their website http://www.pittsburghparking.com/shadyside-garage There is also plenty of public transportation that serves this neighborhood with stops within 2 blocks of the festival (64 71B 71D 75) and 3-5 blocks of the festival (P1 71A 71C 82 86) Stay tuned for updates!,Shadyside Arts Festival during August 29-301318900,224389313,4708992,Frick Art & Historical Center,Pittsburgh, 7227 Reynolds Street,-79.90229,40.446594,arts-culture,Watching Movies; Live Music; Performing Arts; Culture; Theater; ," Please join us under the stars with incredible jazz by the acclaimed musical ensemble Opek led by Pittsburgh jazz saxophonist Ben Opie who will perform a tribute to the music of Pittsburgh native pianist and longtime Duke Ellington collaborator Billy Strayhorn.

Performances October 9 18 2015 at the Andrew Carnegie Free Library &amp; Music Hall Carnegie PA Iolanthe was first produced in London at the &lt;/a&gt;Savoy Theatre in 1882. The Savoy Theatre was also the the first theatre in the world to be lit entirely by electricity and Iolanthe was the first show to open at the theatre after it was electrified. At the time they wrote Iolanthe both Gilbert and Sullivan were in their peak creative years and Iolanthe their seventh work together drew the best from both composer and author. About ""Iolanthe"" A beautiful maiden falls in love with a shepherd boy and wishes to marry him. Her Guardian the Lord Chancellor of the House of Lords refuses to permit it for he wishes for her to marry a Peer of the House. But this tale is just beginning for the shepherd boy is Strephon half fairy/half mortal son of the Fairy Iolanthe a friend of the Fairy Queen. It s NOT a good idea to anger the Fairy Queen! Fairies and Shepherds Politicians and Soldiers and a musical Masterpiece that delights one and all! Iolanthe is a fairy who married a human and bore a son. That\'s bad. When caught she was banished and family abandoned. As the opera opens she is pardoned. Her son Strephon plans to marry Phyllis a ward of the Lord High Chancellor of England (who cares for orphans as part of his official duties). Problem: Everyone in the House of Lords has fallen in love with Phyllis. Permission to marry her is denied so Strephon calls on the fairies for help. They get him into Parliament and ensure that any act he supports passes. The Lords are thrown into disarray by this short-circuit of power politics and by competition over Phyllis. Finally the Chancellor decides to marry her himself. Iolanthe reveals herself as the Chancellor\'s long-lost wife and is condemned to death again. How can Iolanthe\'s execution be stopped? How can Strephon and Phyllis get back together? How can the Lords be rid of the pestiferous Strephon and his infallible legislation? How can a happy ending be found? And if you attend on opening night (October 9) and you ll also be invited to join the cast and crew for a special post-performance reception!

""Nabucco"" is Verdi\'s third opera which is considered to have permanently established Verdi\'s reputation as a composer. Verdi commented that ""this is the opera with which my artistic career really begins. And though I had many difficulties to fight against it is certain that Nabucco was born under a lucky star"". This opera follows the plight of the Jews as they are assaulted conquered and subsequently exiled from their homeland by the Babylonian King Nabucco (in English Nebuchadnezzar II). The opera is set in 587 BC where historical events are used as background for a romantic and political plot. The best-known number from the opera is the ""Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves"" Va pensiero sull\'ali dorate / ""Fly thought on golden wings"" a chorus which is regularly given an encore in many opera houses when performed today. What makes ""Nabucco"" LARGER THAN LIFE? The chills you\'ll get when Mark Delavan (who\'s sung previously here in Pittsburgh as Falstaff Rigoletto and Scarpia) portrays the troubled monarch who takes both his daughters to war with him one daughter gentle Fenena is captured by the Hebrews only to be freed by her Hebrew lover (Ismaele nephew of the King of Jerusalem) while the other daughter Abigaille is consumed by ambition frustration (she wants Ismaele) and rage against anything in her way including her father. The epic story of the Jews in exile in Babylon. The impressive and affecting projections that accompany this big traditional production. That most beloved of choruses ""Va pensiero."" The poignant family story of betrayal and reconciliation at the heart of the opera.

As a reminder it is important to recognize that while everyone may have different religious beliefs we should also try to be respectful and welcoming and realize that we can sometimes have a tendency to overlook historical things in our own region. As always it is also fine if you wish to attend on your own with family/friends instead. Pittsburgh Mass Mob is a group that enjoys going to different churches which have historical significance in terms of architecture rich ethnic/cultural tradition etc. Typically 30-80 people from the Pittsburgh Mass Mob group visit a different church which is selected each month. Of note is that their are similar Mass Mob groups all across the country where visitors are struck by what they experience with comments such as It s like walking back in history. So please feel free to join the Pittsburgh Mass Mob and Father James Gretz who has graciously invited us to his gorgeous All Saints Church appropriately on November 1 on All Saints Day! All Saints parish was founded in 1902 to serve the Catholic community of Etna. The first pastor was appointed in April 1902 and work began on a new church in the summer of 1902 on Wilson St. This first church a frame building was dedicated on August 3 1902. Due to the growth of the congregation the church building quickly became inadequate to meet the needs of the parish. Rather than tear down the church however the parish moved it to another part of its property and built a new church on the site of the old church. The new church was designed by the famous architect John T. Com s http://johntcomes.com/ and groundbreaking began in September 1914 and the finished church was dedicated on December 19 1915. So this church is approaching its historic 100th Anniversary while the parish continues to serve the needs of the Etna community. On September 17 2004 flooding in Etna caused by tropical storm Ivan damaged the church. The flood waters damaged the floor and wiring of the building. The church was closed for six months for repair. During this time Mass was celebrated in the parish activities building. The church reopened on March 19 2005. This church is truly gorgeous from its stunning stained glass windows to even the structure of the building itself. You feel that you have somehow wandered into a charming European village when you see this church. It is amazing.

Check out these great articles about the concert http://triblive.com/aande/music/9021807-74/fuse-music-says#axzz3ncFIKlkF http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music/2015/10/04/2Do-this-week-Oct-4-10-Cultural-events-around-Pittsburgh/stories/201510040058 All tickets are $30 advance ($35 door) and include general admission to the 6:30 PM concert as well as a happy hour beginning at 5 PM. Because everyone has different work schedules and commuting distances to downtown we\'ll plan to meet around 6 PM although others in the group can certainly arrive even earlier to enjoy more of the happy hour. Please note that if the weather is nice we should be able to meet for the pre-concert happy hour in the beautiful Heinz Hall outdoor garden courtyard which has beautifully illuminated water sculptures and a unique view of downtown at night. This event may sell out and so don\'t wait too long to buy your tickets. TICKETS All tickets are $25 and include general admission to the happy hour and concert.

We have a talking stick and we share our feelings experiences and thoughts about a chosen topic for that month. When a person has an emotional release they are supported and given more energy though the joy of the drums. We also drum just for fun! This is a place for healing joy and growth. This month our topic is releasing and transcending judgement. We'll open with a brief meditation then alternate between drumming and discussion based on materials provided at the circle. We wil have plenty of drums though you're welcome to bring one if you have it and want to. We also provide fold up chairs but if this doesn't suit your physical needs you may wish to bring a cushion or like modifier. This circle is about you and what you need. Do you need to express yourself on the drum? Do you need to speak? Do you need to be supported but would rather do so without speaking? Are you looking for a loving accepting community? Do you want energy work? Do you want to hear other people express the same struggles you have so you don t feel alone? This is the place for you to do what you need to do. This is a safe place to open up say the things you normally suppress and be supported. You have two practitioners right there to support you if you need us. We've changed the cost of the circle. By eliminating the discounts we offered we are now able to provide the circle to all people for $10 each if they pre-pay or $15 at the door.

Estimated value of the class is $50The topic is ""Shadow Work and Transforming Personality"". Basically I gave this workshop at an event this past weekend and it went so well we decided to squeeze another one in here in Pittsburgh this year. The event combines Jungaian psychology and shamanic work. We will open with sacred space setting a focus point for our work then proceed to discussing what shadow work is why and how a person can do it and what it\'s history is. We will also discuss what the personality is and how doing shadow work can transform it. The discussion parts will be relatively brief as we will be focusing on the next part which includes four shamanic journeys into the different mental emotional physical and spiritual bodies to actually meet the shadow aspects of our nature and start the transformation process. You will be given the techniques resources and even a sample of grounding essential oils to take home so you can continue this work on your own. Folding chairs provided but if you\'d like something more comfortable to sit or lay on you are welcome to bring it.

We share this information with you because it is a metaphysics event in Pittsburgh that you may enjoy attending. Here the details about the event: Sound Bath with Brooke Smokelin Sound Baths are often referred to as horizontal concerts because everyone lies down on a yoga mat to enjoy the music and receive the vibrational healing. In this relaxed position and state of mind the transcendent sonic experience begins with the pure tones and overtones of quartz crystal singing bowls creating a magnificent matrix of vibration to recalibrate the human energy system into a powerful place of resonance. Every cell of you and all the water within you begins to vibrate and eventually comes into harmony with everything around you- other people a sense of place a feeling of One-ness induced restored and supported by sound. Add to this the blissfulness of a flute singing a song of truth and lightness so bright and clear you will be elevated into a new way of seeing and being. We often begin with the Spirit Drums and end with group free-form toning. It's quite magnificent! I hope you'll join us in the music.... Just relax enjoy the sound bath and receive.

This is Rebekah (http://rebekahgambleholisticpractitioner.com). One effort Sparkle and I are making for our communities this year is something we\'re calling ""Open Discussion."" This is a donation based event we\'re going to bring you once or twice a month. Basically I will be available in the shop during an hour to an hour and a half one evening a month in order to take questions and have an open discussion on a pre-chosen topic for that time period. Sparkle and I have both noticed discussions on when it\'s better to use herbs or essential oils going on around us so we decided that should be one of our topics this month. I will bring a bunch of dried herbs supplements essences and the like and she and I will both bring oils to this event. I am a qualified herbalist and holistic practitioner and Sparkle just so happens to have gone to school at Aroma Apothecary a school for aromatherapy. So you\'ve got two good and qualified people on your hands and lots of fun stuff to play with this month. Which herbs do what? What\'s the difference between an infusion and a decoction and how do I know when to make each? How do I make and use each? How much of an essential oil should I use for which purpose? How can I tell the quality of herbs teas and oils? How does aromatherapy work?We can answer questions like these and many many more. If we can answer your questions we will. If we don\'t know the answer I\'ll point you in the direction you need to go either towards a practitioner or towards a book.

She will also be available by appointment[masked]-3104. Maya Rose has worked and recorded with various artists and musicians throughout the world. Deeply dedicated to SACRED SOUND she activates the memory of paradise in our hearts and the Earth through her celestial voice. Her voice helps activate our DNA our multidimensional selves and leads us into a journey from pristine oceans to endless dimensions in parallel realities and endless multiverses. During her presentations listeners perceive the presence of many angels nature spirits ascended masters and sometimes ...the smell of roses. Besides deep emotional and spiritual healing sometimes spontaneous physical healings happen as well when she sings. Maya connects our hearts to the heart of the Earth and the heart of Heaven with all that is contained in the endless ocean of Love. In her songs and paintings Maya brings forth a language of Light which she has been speaking since childhood. This is a combination of words in Sanskrit Asian languages Hebrew Indian indigenous and star languages. Maya was born in Germany at the age of 16 saw the vision of a mountain village in Mexico where she would meet part of her soul family. After giving birth to 3 children she traveled with two of her children through South America from Peru to Mexico arriving at the Mexican border on her 33th birthday the 26th of July 1992. Later she was guided to Tepoztlan where she has lived for the last 16 years. When she arrived in Tepoztlan she recognized it as the place she had dreamt about and painted at the age of 16. This was a time for raising her children going deep inside working with different musicians painting dreaming creating holding and balancing the energy in this very particular place.Apart from singing for people over the years she has felt a call from Earth to travel and sing in certain places. Rocks mountains rivers oceans... In order to anchor love frequencies and cleanse memories of pain war etc. in certain areas. This is sound acupuncture for Mother Earth. Maya has recently been traveling in South America following some kind of Earth emergency call starting at the top of Machu Picchu in December 2014 and from there to many other different places. Sometimes it can be a little extreme traveling for 3 days by bus just to sing a song in the middle of nowhere. Now again she feels the call to travel this time north serving through her gifts to raise and anchor the vibration of the love wave from the infinite ocean of love.Maya does sound healing group work or one on one. She sings a special song for each person with lying of hands where she is guided. Her voice creates amazing vortexes of pure love. She aligns people s chakras opening them up and bringing their soul back into balance.783 Route 908 Ext.

This is the perfect class for people who are new to journeying and want to see if it's for them or to prepare a participant for future journeying work. I will open the class with a brief history and cultural lesson and brief introduction to journey work and shamanic work. You'll get an idea of where this practice comes from how it's come to be what it is in modern usage in America and the sorts of journeys that many people use. We'll go over the journeys that we will be doing at the event which include: 1. Journeying to meet a power animal or helper. You will need this for all of your journey work from here on out. 2. Journeying for shadow work (also called inner child work or integrative psychology work). This is a chance to meet the darker nature of the self and how this came to be to see what you need to work on healing and integrating. 3. Journeying to upper world for guidance. After the introduction we will get to the journeys. I will use different tools for each journey so you can get an idea of what these feel like. After each journey there will be some quiet time to write down your experience and then we will have the opportunity to share our experiences if you would like. We will also cover some of the pitfalls of journeying and some of it's dangers and how to avoid these. You will need to bring a notebook or something to write on and writing materials so that you can document your experiences for later reference. I will provide water tea and coffee in the lobby but snacks you are welcome to bring. There is also a middle eastern restaurant across the street that is pretty amazing if you want to catch lunch afterwards. There are chairs and a few couches in the office space and one person is also welcome to use the massage table (if you can manage not to go to sleep on it!) but if you have special needs you may want to bring something to ensure you're accommodated properly. The event is $30 pre-registered (send payments to [masked] through pay pal) or $35 at the door. We have limited space for these events so I do encourage you to pre-register. For those of you who are curious as to my qualifications and background in shamanic work here they are: -Training in six traditions both from traditional indigenous people and from modern PhDs. The traditional teachings were done in more of an apprenticeship type work rather than in a classroom and this training has happened in four countries. -All the markers of a shamanic path in childhood as well as the experiences that went with it. -Education in this type of work at three universities and an academy run by practitioners. -Active membership at the Society for Shamanic Practitioners. I'm also qualified in transpersonal psychology which I studied at two universities and one practitioner-run academy. I am currently working towards a PhD and am considering starting a new apprenticeship in medicine work next year.

We all know that with the recent school shooting in Oregon there have been renewed calls for so called ""common sense"" gun control but what do those calling for ""common sense"" measures really mean when they say that? Well both President Obama and Democratic Candidate Hillary Clinton have suggested we mirror Australia\'s gun buy back program. The problem is what neither of them will tell you is that Australia\'s buy back program was not optional IT WAS MANDATORY! So they called it a gun buy back program but make no bones about it it was confiscation! Truth is your right to protect yourself and your family (from criminals OR a tyrannical government) has never been in more peril and that\'s why groups like F.O.A.C. and people like Kim Stolfer are so important.

Hope you had a good one. While I have been ""thinking"" about many issues over the past several months I did not get down to putting it on paper for you. Let\'s get together and discuss them in person. One of the topics is about how our minds are so good at justifying almost everything that we do. I have been watching myself do this all summer and also seeing it in my adolescent children. Only when time passes and we see the outcomes of our choices do we get to reflect. Even then many of us we tend to look for or attribute other circumstances for the results. Please come and share how you handle this extremely important aspect that can impact our life so much.

One person no pets. *****Although not required I'd like to see something unusual in your portraits. Perhaps a different point of view an unusual setting interesting props unique processing creative manipulation an image that tells a story or..... whatever you can think of to make your images stand out from the rest. Although all images in these Flickr groups are not outstanding examples there are many good ones and they may give you an idea of how to pose your portraits: https://www.flickr.com/groups/portraitsthattellastory/pool/ https://www.flickr.com/groups/1835990@N24/pool/ https://www.flickr.com/groups/portraitbyinvite/pool/ Of course there must be millions of portrait shots on Flickr those groups might spark your creativity.***** Each member may submit one or two images. Each should be significantly different (not 2 shots of the same person) and each will be judged separately. NOTE-less than a week left to enter October's Contest: HANDS (see upcoming themes at the end of this announcement) Please check contest rules if you have not already done so: http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-photo-safari/messages/boards/thread/32726552 A reminder that the theme basic rules and special instructions (if any) will appear on the contest album's cover image or its comments when the contest opens. The photo album will open at 3:15 a.m. on the 1st of the month. Photos submitted after midnight on the last day of the month will not be eligible. If you post a photo and change your mind you may delete it and replace it with a different photo before the deadline. If more than 2 photos are submitted the first 2 will be judged; the 3rd will not. Each month's theme can be interpreted literally figuratively abstractly or in any reasonable unreasonable traditional non-traditional serious humorous or imaginative way. If you are interpreting the topic in an obscure way that some people may not understand be sure to leave a caption or comment to explain your thought process. Criteria for judging: Photo quality and composition Interpretation of the theme Creativity Each month s judge will be the previous month s contest winner (to be announced.) ________ FUTURE THEMES: I may add suggestions for some topics. You are free to use them or not. However if something is marked with SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS those must be followed. December: Blur - Special Instructions: Not Bokeh. This is for accidental or intentional blur. Accidental blur might be the result of camera shake or even an accidental snap. The result may look terrible but in some instances may create an interesting effect. Intentional blur might achieve an impressionistic ambience. There are many kinds of blur: lens blur motion blur panning/zooming blur filter blur (Vaseline hairspray stockings cling wrap etc.) each lending its own look and characteristics. You can also create blur though enhancement software. Blur offers many opportunities for producing extraordinary images and which blur to use will depend on your own preferences. Apart from strictly aesthetic reasons consider what kind of mood each technique lends the image with regard to the chosen subject and a message that you want to communicate. For example blur patterns produced by panning support the illusion of motion as well as recording time in a single frame. Lens blur will suggest ambiguity and mystery. Hairspray may add a romantic feel to a photograph. Look at the subject matter lighting colors shapes and textures and decide upon the emotions you wish to convey in your image. Blur can be an effective way of achieving this. Note the winner of the December contest will judge the February Contest instead of January's which will be judged by member's votes. (see below.) January 2016: Your Best Shots of 2015 Special Instructions: Post 4 images that you consider your best images of 2015. All of your images should be of different subjects. All 4 will be judged together as a group plus one individual image will be chosen from all posted images. You must post 4. Winners must be paid members by the end of the contest on 1/31/16. You must either add a title and/or number your images 1 through 4. For this contest the winners will be chosen by our members not by the judge of the previous contest. (The Dec winner will judge the Feb contest.) Voting instructions will be announced once the contest ends (on Feb 1st.) For this contest you must vote to win (but not for your own images.) Every member (whether participating in the contest or not) will be able to submit one ballot. BONUS: Two Prizes of one-year free membership. Two winners will not have to pay dues the next time they come due!

If you post a photo and change your mind you may delete it and replace it with a different photo before the deadline. If more than 2 photos are submitted the first 2 will be judged; the 3rd will not. Each month's theme can be interpreted literally figuratively abstractly or in any reasonable unreasonable traditional non-traditional serious humorous or imaginative way. If you are interpreting the topic in an obscure way that some people may not understand be sure to leave a caption or comment to explain your thought process. Criteria for judging: Photo quality and composition Interpretation of the theme Creativity Each month s judge will be the previous month s contest winner (to be announced.) ________ FUTURE THEMES: I may add suggestions for some topics. You are free to use them or not. However if something is marked with SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS those must be followed. November: Portrait Special Instructions: Portraits should be of one individual only. December: Blur - Special Instructions: Not Bokeh. This is for accidental or intentional blur. Accidental blur might be the result of camera shake or even an accidental snap. The result may look terrible but in some instances may create an interesting effect. Intentional blur might achieve an impressionistic ambience. There are many kinds of blur: lens blur motion blur panning/zooming blur filter blur (Vaseline hairspray stockings cling wrap etc.) each lending its own look and characteristics. You can also create blur though enhancement software. Blur offers many opportunities for producing extraordinary images and which blur to use will depend on your own preferences. Apart from strictly aesthetic reasons consider what kind of mood each technique lends the image with regard to the chosen subject and a message that you want to communicate. For example blur patterns produced by panning support the illusion of motion as well as recording time in a single frame. Lens blur will suggest ambiguity and mystery. Hairspray may add a romantic feel to a photograph. Look at the subject matter lighting colors shapes and textures and decide upon the emotions you wish to convey in your image. Blur can be an effective way of achieving this. January 2016: Your Best Shots of 2015 Special Instructions: Post 4 images that you consider your best images of 2015. All 4 will be judged together as a group plus one individual image will be chosen. You must post 4. You must either add a title and/or number your images 1 through 4. For this contest the winners will be chosen by our members not by the judge of the previous contest. (The Dec winner will judge the Feb contest.) Voting instructions will be announced once the contest ends (on Feb 1st.) For this contest you must vote to win (but not for your own images.)

Carrie Furnace's entrance seems to be near the Rankin Bridge so if you get lost ask someone how to get to the bridge. If you are coming from the south Bob's Autotorium (1408 River Rd Whitaker 15120) is on the other side of the Mon near the Rankin Bridge. For those without GPS: Exit at Swissvale (exit 77 from I-376E). Keep left to take ramp toward Edgewood/Braddock/Kennywood. Merge onto Monongahela Ave. Turn Right onto S Braddock Ave which becomes Kenmawr. Slight left onto Ridge Ave. There should be signs to follow in that area if not sooner.

Time got away from me and by the time I thought about it it was too late ( that and my bad habit of procrastinating). Anyway November is here and good Fall get together is in order. I would like to return to a few of the original concepts of Pints and Prints. Besides being an opportunity to mix good conversation with good food and good friends Pints and Prints was a chance to get feed back on your images. This is especially good for newer members who are not used to presenting their work to other people. I would like everyone attending to please bring at least two images that they would like feed back on. They could be two different images or they could be the same image processed differently. After we eat and talk a little each person will present their work to the group for discussion. We will keep all comments constructive and fair. This will help members to see something in their work that they may have overlooked and improve the quality of their work.

It's great to have a ton of people at ANY event but we have people leaving early because there are too many people there. Unfortunately it's always impossible to gauge how many people are actually going to show up despite how many people do or do not RSVP. Therefore I have no reason to cap the amount of people that can attend because there's no guarantee everyone who already RSVP'd is actually going to be there. If we have too many people we'll either have something else to do in the deep outfield or find a way to run a mini tournament so everyone gets good playing time. I'm all about making this the most fun it can be and understand the challenges we have with too many people. The new rules definitely worked well and I think we'll keep the bases closer together so we have more scoring in the games. We've been playing on the actual field lately so make sure you prepare with clothing you can slide on the dirt with. I'd advise not wearing jeans or all black as it has been very hot for the games lately.

Join us at the Junction Hollow Soccer Field. To get there type 100 Boundary St Pittsburgh PA into your GPS and once on Boundary St go under the railroad track overpass and you\'ll soon see the parking lot for the field. Big Ball is more fun than it looks. Check out the details below. No spikes or cleats are permitted for this game. Come join us for this unique but fun game! This game got quite popular last year and was requested as our Meetup of the week for 7 straight weeks. The name of the game is Big Ball. I created this game during my junior year at IUP. The best way to describe the game is that it\'s a mix between Soccer and Ultimate Frisbee but we use a ball that\'s about 45"" in diameter. We played it every week for 2 years on the practice soccer field. There is no physical contact with other players permitted but you can use the ball however you want. Any part of your body can touch the ball and there\'s no height limit on the goals. Also NO CLEATS OR SPIKES ALLOWED! To see a video of this game in action from 3 years ago check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deBQzfRsBg0 We will be playing this game at Junction Hollow Field off of Second Avenue a bit past the Hot Metal Bridge. Here are some more details &amp; rules. Field size we need is about 60 - 70 yards based on how many players we get (best games are at least 7 vs 7) There are 3 lines that matter in the game...the goal line on each side and the line at the center of the field. There are no out of bounds lines on the sides of the field. Players can dribble roll kick throw or carry the ball for 3 steps The goals are 12 feet wide and there is no height limit on the goal. The game relies heavily on defense. There are also no regulations for goalies or a goalie box. This means your goalie can play mid field if he wants or you can even have 3 goalies...they can even piggyback on each other to be ""taller"" if they want. You just lose those additional players in the field Both teams start the game and after each goal at mid-field. The team that wins the coin toss or just got scored on start with the ball. As soon as anything crosses mid-field (the ball OR one of your players that\'s getting a running start) the other team is allowed to cross the line and start playing defense. As mentioned above there is no physical contact with other players but you can use the ball however you want. If you\'re in the process of taking your 3 steps you can plow people over with the ball. If someone is charging you you can kick the ball at them you can hit people with the ball...I just prefer you don\'t aim for the head. If you do actually blatantly contact someone you get a warning and a 2 minute penalty. Second offense in the same game gets you ejected from the game. This only happened once in 2 years of playing as the ball does a good enough job of not getting players TOO close to each other... The ball is built like an exercise ball but it\'s VERY heavy. I would strongly advise players not try to punch the ball while it\'s in the air hit it with one arm or kick it with your feet as it could easily result in an injury or twisting of the body. On that note it\'s easiest to ""kick"" the ball with your knees or thigh hit it with two hands punching close together or hit with the forearms while hands are clenched at the fists. We sometimes have players get into a ""scrum"" around the ball and it doesn\'t move for a while. If that happens and the ball doesn\'t move for 3 - 5 seconds we\'ll have a jump ball from where the ""scrum"" took place. Games are normally played until 11 and we switch sides of the field when one team scores 6. We usually take a little half-time break at that point too. We have had many girls play the sport and they loved it. A few of them even had trouble picking the ball up but they still loved the game. Some of them were actually our most die-hard players. We normally start every game kicking and throwing the ball in a circle to get everyone warmed up for how big and heavy the ball actually is The game is actually the most fun in the rain because of our most important rule... NO CLEATS OR SPIKES OF ANY KIND! All players must wear tennis shoes or some other kind of non-grip shoe so they don\'t have any advantage in the dirt or grass. That\'s the way we\'ve always played and I feel that makes everyone very even when it comes to maneuverability on the field. You can only imagine what some rain puddles and slick grass add to a game where no one has traction. Good times.

I just got a new version of wiffle ball in the mail called Blitzball. The ball is plastic like a wiffle ball but does not have holes in it like a wiffle ball. Instead it basically looks like a golf ball but with flat sides instead of dimples. Supposedly this ball can go up to 200 ft which is way more than any wiffle ball I've seen. I'm heading to Dick's today to buy some supplies so we have enough bats balls and other equipment in case anything breaks. I have 3 Blitzballs and a Blitzball bat which is a plastic version of a wooden bat. Seems pretty solid.

During our game on July 25th we had a random group of guys in Pittsburgh join us that were in town celebrating a Bachelor party so we ended up having 31 people playing kickball at one point. I know there were some people who got stuck in some major traffic and also who were out of town on vacation so hopefully we can have a good turnout for this upcoming game. The new rules definitely worked well and the new challenge was the distance between bases set at 60'. We got to play on the actual field and had gorgeous weather all day (the heat was a bit intense at times). For those that stuck around all day we ended up playing 3 full games of kickball.

Join us at the Junction Hollow Soccer Field. To get there type 100 Boundary St Pittsburgh PA into your GPS and once on Boundary St go under the railroad track overpass and you\'ll soon see the parking lot for the field. Big Ball is more fun than it looks. Check out the details below. No spikes or cleats are permitted for this game. Come join us for this unique but fun game! This game got quite popular last year and was requested as our Meetup of the week for 7 straight weeks. The name of the game is Big Ball. I created this game during my junior year at IUP. The best way to describe the game is that it\'s a mix between Soccer and Ultimate Frisbee but we use a ball that\'s about 45"" in diameter. We played it every week for 2 years on the practice soccer field. There is no physical contact with other players permitted but you can use the ball however you want. Any part of your body can touch the ball and there\'s no height limit on the goals. Also NO CLEATS OR SPIKES ALLOWED! To see a video of this game in action from 3 years ago check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deBQzfRsBg0 We will be playing this game at Junction Hollow Field off of Second Avenue a bit past the Hot Metal Bridge. Here are some more details &amp; rules. Field size we need is about 60 - 70 yards based on how many players we get (best games are at least 7 vs 7) There are 3 lines that matter in the game...the goal line on each side and the line at the center of the field. There are no out of bounds lines on the sides of the field. Players can dribble roll kick throw or carry the ball for 3 steps The goals are 12 feet wide and there is no height limit on the goal. The game relies heavily on defense. There are also no regulations for goalies or a goalie box. This means your goalie can play mid field if he wants or you can even have 3 goalies...they can even piggyback on each other to be ""taller"" if they want. You just lose those additional players in the field Both teams start the game and after each goal at mid-field. The team that wins the coin toss or just got scored on start with the ball. As soon as anything crosses mid-field (the ball OR one of your players that\'s getting a running start) the other team is allowed to cross the line and start playing defense. As mentioned above there is no physical contact with other players but you can use the ball however you want. If you\'re in the process of taking your 3 steps you can plow people over with the ball. If someone is charging you you can kick the ball at them you can hit people with the ball...I just prefer you don\'t aim for the head. If you do actually blatantly contact someone you get a warning and a 2 minute penalty. Second offense in the same game gets you ejected from the game. This only happened once in 2 years of playing as the ball does a good enough job of not getting players TOO close to each other... The ball is built like an exercise ball but it\'s VERY heavy. I would strongly advise players not try to punch the ball while it\'s in the air hit it with one arm or kick it with your feet as it could easily result in an injury or twisting of the body. On that note it\'s easiest to ""kick"" the ball with your knees or thigh hit it with two hands punching close together or hit with the forearms while hands are clenched at the fists. We sometimes have players get into a ""scrum"" around the ball and it doesn\'t move for a while. If that happens and the ball doesn\'t move for 3 - 5 seconds we\'ll have a jump ball from where the ""scrum"" took place. Games are normally played until 11 and we switch sides of the field when one team scores 6. We usually take a little half-time break at that point too. We have had many girls play the sport and they loved it. A few of them even had trouble picking the ball up but they still loved the game. Some of them were actually our most die-hard players. We normally start every game kicking and throwing the ball in a circle to get everyone warmed up for how big and heavy the ball actually is The game is actually the most fun in the rain because of our most important rule... NO CLEATS OR SPIKES OF ANY KIND! All players must wear tennis shoes or some other kind of non-grip shoe so they don\'t have any advantage in the dirt or grass. That\'s the way we\'ve always played and I feel that makes everyone very even when it comes to maneuverability on the field. You can only imagine what some rain puddles and slick grass add to a game where no one has traction. Good times. Join us on Thursday September 3rd at Junction Hollow Field in Squirrel Hill for a game of Big Ball. Just show up to the park to play and bring some friends. Don\'t forget the number one rule...No SPIKES!",Big Ball - Junction Hollow Field1530362,226717550,16905892,Butcher and The Rye,Pittsburgh, 212 6th Street,-80.002068,40.442333,sports-recreation,New In Town; Nightlife; Social Networking; Sports and Recreation; Social; Fun Times; Adventure; Pittsburgh area; ,I know there hasn't been any events for a while and I'm hoping to change that.

Of course we'll visit the Rachel Carson Homestead and Glen's Custard but we'll also stop at a few lesser known places like the PPG plant. Just like this description this hike will be a bit shorter than usual (3.3 miles a little under 2 hours if you don't stay for lunch) so yinz can get home for the Steelers game! If you're not in a hurry stick around and grab some pumpkin pie custard at Glen's or some Pumpking beer and a warm bowl of soup at Ladle's. As always we hike rain shine or cold so be sure to bring the appropriate gear. This hike will be entirely on sidewalk (no city steps or dirt trails) so if you can handle pushing uphill it would be stroller-friendly. Although we're meeting at Glen' s please do not park in their lot. There is on-street parking on Porter Street (the side street next to Glen's) above and below Pittsburgh Street and in the neighborhood nearby. We look forward to seeing you on Sunday! PS.

The reasons were two fold. First to me an image has no meaning if it is only seen on a phone tablet or computer screen. Photos are meant to be hung on a wall and admired properly. Second there is hardly any better feeling for a photographer than to have his/her work hung in a gallery. last year that attempt fell through (I blame the Post Office). This year it is coming together. Pamela Russell has offered her Gallery space for this show. This is what I need from the members: I want you to email me two of your best images a first choice and a second choice. Send it to [masked]. The file should be no larger than 5x7 but at 300dpi. The gallery has space for about 50-75 images. If every member sends in an image then I will have to edit some but if fewer members send in images then you may get both images in.Conditions for the show: There are no limitations on subject matter. This is a Fine Art group so nudes are acceptable. B&amp;W or Color is fine. The only limitations are on frame size. All images MUST be mounted matted and framed. Frame size is not to exceed 16x20. All frames MUST be black metal and matts MUST be white. I have set those conditions because of continuity. This is a group show and I want the images to speak for themselves not the frames.The show opens Oct 30th. Prints will need to be delivered to Pamela's Gallery no later than Oct 26th. There are very talented photographers in this group so let's make this a fantastic show,New Anouncement : Gallery Show Open to All Members1730736,dxthtdytmbdc,1423688,Sharon Community Presbyterian Church,Moon Township, 522 Carnot Road,-80.220627,40.513222,parents-family,Moms; Playdates; Babies; New Moms; Toddlers; Babywearing; First-Time Pregnant Moms; Preschoolers; Postpartum Support Group; Breastfeeding Moms; Support Groups for New Moms; ,The Storkbites meeting is from 11 AM until 1 PM at the Sharon Community Presbyterian Church at 522 Carnot Road in Moon Township.

The former Saint Agnes Parish church is the location of this month\'s Pittsburgh Mass Mob. This parish was formed in 1868 for the growing Oakland community between downtown and the Strip District to the west and East Liberty to the east. This church was dedicated to service in January 1917 and served the parish for 75 years until is was suppressed by the Diocese of Pittsburgh and sold to the Sisters of Mercy at Carlow University. The church was designed by my favorite Pittsburgh architect John Theodore Comes. It is designed in the Lombardy style that was copied from churches in France and Spain. This tapestry brick stone and concrete edifice sits at the top of the long Fifth Avenue descent into Pittsburgh. For a time is was the location of the Latin (Tridentine) Mass before the diocese closure. The stained glass windows designed by Pittsburgh designer George W. Sotter and the richly painted murals painted by Cincinnati native Felix B. Lieftuchter are breathtaking. The high altar side altars communion rail and baptistery are executed in creamy marble with mosaic inlay accents by New York sculptor Henry Schmitt. Look at the unique and detailed fa ade of the church. The central wheel window has a Calvary group sculpted into it! And the tympanum over all three entrance doors is exquisitely detailed. All this work is the hand of Francis (Frank) Aretz. His medium is cast concrete rather than stone! Amazing. Every aspect of this church indicates the fine degree of craftsmanship and artistry offered for a House of God. You will want to get here early and linger over the rich detail that abounds this holy place! A tour of the architectural detail of the church will follow the Mass. A reception will follow the Mass at the back of the church. Ample parking is located at two adjacent lots to the left and right of the church along Fifth Avenue and Robinson Street. One restroom is located in the church vestibule (not ADA compliant). No ADA entrance is available to this church (a few steps enter into the priests sacristy side door). ***Greetings to everyone Just to let you know there will be a pre-Mass tour of St. Agnes at 6:15 this Sunday given by our own historian David. Please join us and be sure to bring your cameras for this rare opportunity to experience the beauty and majesty of this church yourself. Be sure to take pictures of the murals behind the altar truly majestic. You can see some of them in the video that I made of St. Agnes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-ZYK-j1JlE There will be a light reception immediately following the Mass in the back of St. Agnes. Since it is a school night they will be closing the church around 8:30 and so that is why they have asked us to hold the tour before 7:00. Thank you to those of you that have signed up. If you know of anyone that attended St. Agnes as a child if you could let them know about this opportunity to go to church there again please feel free to pass this information on to them.

The church\'s Romanesque style was designed by architect John T. Comes [masked]) for the firm Rutan and Russell. Comes also designed Saint John the Baptist Church also in Lawrenceville for the Beezer Brothers architectural firm. Construction for St. Augustine Church began in September of 1899 and was dedicated on May 21 1901. The beautiful stained glass windows are also wonderful pieces of history. They were imported from Munich Germany. The parish has been operated by the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor Capuchin (OFM Cap) since the 1870s when there was a call for German speaking priests put out by Bishop Domenec early in the history of the Diocese of Pittsburgh. There will be a tour of the church immediately following Mass. We can\'t wait for you to witness the beauty of this exquisite example of German Romanesque Catholic Churches in Pittsburgh! Bring your cameras invite family friends and neighbors to help rediscover another one of Pittsburgh\'s hidden gems that deserves to be a part of our vibrant community once more!

His first book The First Modern Jew: Spinoza and the History of an Image traces the shifting image of the seventeenth-century Dutch Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza in modern Jewish culture. It was co-winner of the 2012 American Academy for Jewish Research\'s Salo Wittmayer Baron Prize and a finalist for the 2012 National Jewish Book Award in History. Professor Schwartz is currently working on a new research project a genealogy of the ghetto that traces its evolution as a word concept metaphor and place in both Jewish history and beyond Jewish contexts as such. His research interests include Jewish historical consciousness early modern and modern Jewish identities and Jewish intellectuals. The term ghetto is among the most fraught and freighted in the vocabulary of Jewish culture and history. Indeed it has not only featured prominently in virtually all the major developments of modern Jewish history from emancipation to antisemitism from urbanization to suburbanization and from mass migration to mass murder. The ghetto has been fundamental to the very definition and constitution of Jewish modernity. For all this explosion of ghetto-talk the term has arguably become central to the collective history and identity of only one other people beyond Jews namely African Americans. Ultimately the story of the term s migration from Jewish to black concerns more than simply the changing nuance of a particular word. The transference of the ghetto was a semantic as much as a socioeconomic historical development and indeed was understood as such.

During the day when the battle reenactment is not going on the reenactors will be in their camps and will be more than willing to answer questions about the role they play and the period they are demonstrating. In addition to that we will have a children\'s area where period games will be taught and the children can do crafts. The museum will also be open to all attendees. Guides will be available to talk to you about some of the artifacts in the museum and there will be some artists on site to discuss their art. On Saturday we will also be having wargaming demonstrations of the Battle of Bushy Run. There will also be a dedication of the Byerly Trail at 12:30. On Sunday at 12:30 there will be a presentation in the Stone Room on Rangers from the period. The event runs from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day. Cost is $5.

But in the cases in question the probabilities of guilt or culpability are apparently very high high enough to meet the relevant standard of evidence. This problem is known as the \'proof paradox\'. An oft-expressed position is that legal verdicts should be based on \'specific\' rather than \'general\' evidence of guilt. But despite considerable academic debate it remains unclear whether a position along these lines can be defended and if so whether the problem with general evidence is ultimately moral or epistemic in character. We argue that all other things being equal moral considerations should not influence the import of legal evidence. Moreover the most promising epistemic distinction between specific and general evidence does not warrant downgrading the latter in a legal trial. Finally we argue that in the problem cases the probabilistic inferences are after all wanting. We explain this in terms of \'meta-uncertainty\' and suggest a rethinking of the roles for and relationship between specific and general evidence.

This is a donation based event we\'re going to bring you once or twice a month. Basically I will be available in the shop during an hour to an hour and a half one evening a month in order to take questions and have an open discussion on a pre-chosen topic for that time period. We wanted to do something different and maybe a little new age-y and talk about rocks and such. I\'m going to bring my stones and show you how they are used in my practice for mediation journeying and healing work including the stones I used in my successful recovery from several feminine disorders. I will also share with you how some of these rocks were used in ancient medicine and healing practices and how some are used today. A friend of mine Dan happens to be a rock person and is going to bring some of his favorites to talk about too. Joyce has many varieties of some of these stones in shop for sale if you would like to take them home (and she\'s incredibly reasonable so I often buy stones here). This is going to be as interactive as you want it to be; you will have the ability to work with these stones if you choose to but nothing will be forced on you in the least. If we can answer your questions we will. If we don\'t know the answer I\'ll point you in the direction you need to go either towards a practitioner or towards a book. This event is being offered without charge in the interest of building a healthy community but if you\'d like to support my work and the shop donations are happily accepted.

Tickets for the free event are available here. David Greene host of NPR\'s Morning EditionCREDIT DAVID GILKEYIn collaboration with NPR Member stations NPR Presents: Family Matters is a live national events series that connects regular people with financial experts for invaluable conversations around money. Led by NPR Morning Edition host David Greene and Business correspondents Yuki Noguchi and Sonari Glinton these live (and lively) events are driven by an audience ready to talk strategy: from accumulating debt and amassing wealth; to saving for college home ownership retirement and even fitting in a midlife extravagance or two. In Pittsburgh Greene and Noguchi will be joined on stage by personal finance experts Louis Barajas founder and chief wealth and business manager at LAB Financial Life Solutions and Saundra Davis a U.S. Navy Veteran and financial coach who works alongside community-based organizations that empower low income Americans with tools to build and grow assets. Together they will leave audience members with greater confidence in their financial futures. The public can follow and participate in these conversations with #NPRFamilyMatters. NPR Business Reporter Yuki NoguchiThrough reporting projects that have taken them to the living rooms banks and offices where people are making big decisions about money Greene and Noguchi each have unique perspectives on the specific pressures families face today. Greene has been hosting Family Matters events in communities across the country since 2013. In the Morning Edition series Family Matters: The Money Squeeze he joined three families to explore the financial challenges of the ""sandwich generation those balancing elder-care costs college-bound kids and post-employment retirement plans. Noguchi regularly reports on workplace issues from abusive working environments to idiosyncratic cubicle culture and national stories that strongly affect working Americans such as the housing market meltdown and wage disputes.

About The Panelists David Greene Co-Host Morning Edition @NPRGreene David Greene co-hosts NPR s #1 newsmagazine Morning Edition alongside Renee Montagne and Steve Inskeep. David has interviewed everyone from presidents to pop stars but he believes that everyone whether famous or not has a compelling story to tell it just takes listening. David has brought home human interest stories from places like North Dakota as Americans grapple with the issue of same-sex marriage and Crimea where uneasiness around geopolitical unrest and national identity is perennial and complex. Prior to stepping into the host chair David spent two years abroad as an NPR international correspondent based in Moscow. During the Arab Spring David spent a month reporting from Libya as NATO bombs fell on Tripoli for which he was honored with the Daniel Schorr Journalism Prize. David also spent four years covering the G.W. Bush administration; a position that led him to five continents to NPR s spacious booth in the basement of the West Wing and aboard Air Force One as President Bush first surveyed the devastation from Hurricane Katrina and afterward met with affected New Orleans residents. David reported deeply on Hillary Clinton s 2008 presidential campaign and after President Obama took office spent three months driving across America documenting how the recession was affecting the lives of regular Americans. David was a reporter for the Baltimore Sun for nearly seven years before he joined NPR in 2005. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard with a degree in government. Yuki Noguchi NPR Business Desk Correspondent in Washington D.C. @YukiNoguchi As NPR Business correspondent Yuki Noguchi regularly reports on workplace issues from abusive working environments to idiosyncratic cubicle culture and national stories that strongly affect working Americans such as the housing market meltdown and wage disputes.

She s similarly synthesized other evolving workplace dynamics such as Zappos holocratic employee structure Amazon s inclusion of peer reviews in staff evaluations and a 2015 federal law requiring public companies to disclose ratios comparing their CEO s compensation to their workers median pay. Since joining NPR in 2008 Noguchi has reported deeply on business and economic news and in recent years has covered the housing market meltdown unemployment during the Great Recession and the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami in Japan.

All films are co-presented by Silk Screen. A live poetry reading by Persian Pittsburgh will be at 7:30. The movie starts at 8:00 pm.Based on Satrapi s graphic novel about her life in pre and post-revolutionary Iran and then in Europe. The film traces Satrapi s growth from child to rebellious punk-loving teenager in Iran. In the background are the growing tensions of the political climate in Iran in the 70s and 80s with members of her liberal-leaning family detained and then executed and the background of the disastrous Iran/Iraq war. The film was co-winner of the Jury Prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. However it has drawn complaints from the Iranian government and was initially banned in Lebanon after some clerics found it to be offensive to Iran and Islam. On 7 October 2011 the film was shown on the Tunisian private television station Nessma. A day later a demonstration formed and marched on the station. Nabil Karoui the owner of Nessma TV faced trial in Tunis on charges of violating sacred values and disturbing the public order . He was found guilty and ordered to pay a fine of 2400 dinars ($1700; 1000) a much more lenient punishment than predicted. A live poetry reading by Persian Pittsburgh will precede the screening.,Free screening of the movie Persepolis banned in Iran1756412,224352068,20771402,Jam on Walnut,Pittsburgh, Corner of Filbert St. and Walnut Street,-79.932976,40.451439,socializing,Musicians; Singles; Watching Movies; Live Music; Nightlife; Language & Culture; Social; Outdoors; Fun Times; Adventure; Artists; Volunteering; Writing; Performing Arts; Theater; Fun and Free; ,90 RSVP\'s (excluding duplicates) between 7 meetups!

This is a donation based event we\'re going to bring you once or twice a month. Basically I will be available in the shop during an hour to an hour and a half one evening a month in order to take questions and have an open discussion on a pre-chosen topic for that time period. We\'re going to do a dream work discussion this time. What are the layers of dreaming? How can you increase or decrease your dreaming? What is lucid dreaming and how can you do it? How can you remember your dreams? What does a dream mean? What can you do for nightmares? How can you use dreaming to change your reality? Feel free to bring a dream if you want to. :-) If we can answer your questions we will. If we don\'t know the answer I\'ll point you in the direction you need to go either towards a practitioner or towards a book. This event is being offered without charge in the interest of building a healthy community but if you\'d like to support my work and the shop donations of $5 are happily accepted and split between me and the shop.

Dave Speer president and co-founder of MellonHead Labs will speak about: Water quality issues facing Pittsburgh and the nation how CMU is involved and water and environmental programs how these programs function and are supported/funded and the future of water quality monitoring technology and IoT (internet of things).

This is Rebekah (http://rebekahgambleholisticpractitioner.com). One effort Sparkle and I are making for our communities this year is something we\'re calling ""Open Discussion."" This is a donation based event we\'re going to bring you once or twice a month. Basically I will be available in the shop during an hour to an hour and a half one evening a month in order to take questions and have an open discussion on a pre-chosen topic for that time period. Sparkle and I have both noticed discussions on when it\'s better to use herbs or essential oils going on around us so we decided that should be one of our topics this month. I will bring a bunch of dried herbs supplements essences and the like and she and I will both bring oils to this event. I am a qualified herbalist and holistic practitioner and Sparkle just so happens to have gone to school at Aroma Apothecary a school for aromatherapy. So you\'ve got two good and qualified people on your hands and lots of fun stuff to play with this month. Which herbs do what? What\'s the difference between an infusion and a decoction and how do I know when to make each? How do I make and use each? How much of an essential oil should I use for which purpose? How can I tell the quality of herbs teas and oils? How does aromatherapy work?We can answer questions like these and many many more. If we can answer your questions we will. If we don\'t know the answer I\'ll point you in the direction you need to go either towards a practitioner or towards a book. This event is being offered without charge in the interest of building a healthy community but if you\'d like to support my work and the shop donations are happily accepted. Look for a new topic and a new conversation in September!",Open Discussion: Herbs and Oils1756412,225987319,21508182,Rum Runners,Pittsburgh, 3385 Babcock Blvd,-80.021797,40.536888,socializing,Musicians; Singles; Watching Movies; Live Music; Nightlife; Language & Culture; Social; Outdoors; Fun Times; Adventure; Artists; Volunteering; Writing; Performing Arts; Theater; Fun and Free; ,We had a GREAT turn out at Rum runners last season so we\'re hoping for another one this Sunday enjoying food and drink specials with a ton of TV\'s and a great atmosphere.

October 3 1925 the parish of St. Therese of Lisieux was established by Father Joseph D. Hagan. Plans to build a church were halted due to the crash of 1929. After World War II and the revival of the steel plants work once again began in earnest towards the creation of this beautiful church and school. St. Therese of Lisieux School was blessed on August 21 1954. Mass was first celebrated in the basement of this new school until St. Therese of Lisieux Church was finally completed and put into faithful service beginning in 1958. St. Therese of Lisieux Church is a beautiful church with many unique elements that add to the charm of this House of Worship. It contains a unique chapel dedicated to this beloved saint who is called The Little Flower of Jesus . It contains both first and second class relics of this doctor of the Catholic Church made famous in part by her best-selling autobiography The Story of a Soul . It also contains distinct stained glass windows that lovingly tell the stories from both the Old and New Testaments as well as pageants of Pittsburgh scenes honoring the lives of some of the hardworking people that helped make our city what she is today. Just recently St. Therese\'s church made the news when one of it\'s bells was repaired and reinstalled. If you would like to see the video honoring this event the link is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGkl-cAqD-Q As you can tell from this video this is truly a fun-loving Faith community! The reason that Father and I chose this date is that this is the Sunday when St. Therese of Lisieux\'s church celebrates the feast day of their patron saint by finishing their nine-day novena to her as well as hosting a procession outside the church in honor of her. We will be able to partake in this joyous celebration a first for Pittsburgh Mass Mob! Please invite family and friends for this special day. You don\'t want to miss this one!

In the beginning of May this year I was walking with my dog in the woods and saw some very interesting and beautiful flower petals and flowers scattered throughout the forest floor. Due to a very dense understory I couldn t see where the flowers where coming from. I felt pretty ignorant being I m in the woods a lot and I ve never seen this before. The tree in question is the Tulip Tree aka Yellow Poplar and is the tallest hardwood in PA. I ve learned a lot since then mostly thanks to the great little book Trees of Pennsylvania (on the shelf at B&amp;N for about $12) and a lot of help from Google images. FYI there is an App called LeafSnap for anyone interested.In Frick Park a large percentage of the trees in Trees of PA can be found. These are trees that are found throughout the state but would not normally be found in one location. Numerous species are not native but have escaped into the forests. I ve put together a hike around Frick Park to ID a lot of different trees. I figured I would do this next spring but I ran into Bill on Sunday at the Steelers meetup and he s making me do it this Saturday! Bill has recently returned to the burgh after spending a couple of decades in Portland . Though some trees have lost their leaves the colors are maxing out about now. The hike should take 3 - 3.5 hrs and is dog friendly.,Tree Identification Hike @ Frick Park1756412,sdlwflytnbgb,21116272,Arcade Comedy Theater,Pittsburgh, 811 Liberty Aveune 15222,0,0,socializing,Musicians; Singles; Watching Movies; Live Music; Nightlife; Language & Culture; Social; Outdoors; Fun Times; Adventure; Artists; Volunteering; Writing; Performing Arts; Theater; Fun and Free; ,Catch some fresh cutting edge improv comedy at our weekly showcase.

Dr. Timothy Pearce Assistant Curator &amp; Head Section of Mollusks Carnegie Museum of Natural History. ""Wily Land Snails of Pennsylvania: Where Do They Live and Which Are Rare?""A local scientist\'s work is dramatically increasing what we know about Pennsylvania\'s 129 land snail species. For the Pennsylvania Land Snail Atlas Project Dr. Timothy Pearce collected 17472 records of Pennsylvania land snails from modern field work and museum specimens documenting thousands of new county records. Many minute species are now known to be widespread although they previously seemed to be rare. Dr. Pearce assistant curator and head of the section of mollusks at Carnegie Museum of Natural History will discuss his work in ""Wily Land Snails of Pennsylvania: Where Do They Live and Which Are Rare?"" at Caf Scientifique. Dr. Pearce gained an important historical perspective on ecology while working toward a master\'s degree in snail paleontology at University of California at Berkeley then he continued studying snail ecology for a PhD at University of Michigan. During a year-long post-doctoral study in Madagascar he helped find more than 600 undescribed land snail species. During his first curator job at the Delaware Museum he was awarded that institution\'s first National Science Foundation grant. His current research at Carnegie Museum of Natural History ecological snail studies in the northeastern and northwestern regions of the United States and in Colombia South America.

The cultural festival will follow at 3:30 p.m. in the Commons Room of the Cathedral of Learning 4200 Fifth Ave. Oakland.

The ceremony will commence with the singing of the United States and the Republic of Korea s national anthems. Speakers will include University of Pittsburgh The Classroom\'s ceiling featuring two wooden phoenixes forming the symbolic pearl of wisdom.The Classroom\'s ceiling featuring two wooden phoenixes forming the symbolic pearl of wisdom.Chancellor Emeritus and the Chair of the University s Institute of Politics Mark A. Nordenberg as well as Ahn Ho-Young the national ambassador of the Republic of Korea to the United States and E. Maxine Bruhns director of Pitt s Nationality Rooms and Intercultural Exchange Programs. Following formal remarks the Korean Heritage Classroom Committee a group of local Korean-American citizens who oversaw the classroom s funding efforts will present a specially made ceremonial key to Nordenberg. The key presentation symbolizes the committee gifting the classroom to the University of Pittsburgh. The cultural festival will feature performances by Korean-American talent as well as entertainers from abroad. Notable performers will include the Maryland-based Korean Performing Arts Academy of America the Korean Pittsburgh Women s Chorus the Young Brothers Tae Kwon Do Academy and the internationally acclaimed Korean Children s Choir from South Korea. Authentic Korean food and crafts will be available and Pitt s Quo Vadis Guides Nationality Room student tour guides with extensive knowledge of each room will offer tours of the Korean Heritage Classroom to attendees. The Korean Heritage Classroom stands as a tribute to the culture and history of what are now North and South Korea said Bruhns who has overseen the construction of 11 Nationality Rooms since becoming director in June 1965. For nearly 90 years the University of Pittsburgh s Nationality and Heritage Classrooms have recognized the diverse group cultures that came together to make Pittsburgh and the United States of America great places to live learn and work. We welcome our latest addition celebrating both their history and our future together. The Korean Heritage Classroom s design keeps with Pitt s longstanding requirement that all Nationality Rooms represent a time period prior to 1787 the year of Finely carved woodwork crafted by artisans who specialize in traditional Korean architecture.Finely carved woodwork crafted by artisans who specialize in traditional Korean architecture.the University s founding and the signing of the U.S. Constitution. The design concept was inspired by the Myeongnyundang translated as Hall of Enlightenment the main lecture hall of South Korea s Sungkyunkwan University. Founded in 1398 Sungkyunkwan served as Korea s royal academy and was the region s foremost institution of higher education for nearly two centuries. Today the lecture hall continues to be used for special ceremonial events and is recognized throughout Asia as a prominent historical monument. Like the Hall of Enlightenment the Korean Heritage Classroom depicts three connected rooms with two oak columns forming a symbolic boundary. The center room is longer with a lofty ceiling. Sungkyunkwan officials used the center room for ceremonies lectures rituals and other important public events. The two smaller adjoining rooms were used for faculty research and private meetings. The ceiling of the central room is adorned with a pair of wooden phoenixes inspired by the royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. All windows are covered with a specially produced paper product made of mulberry tree fibers. Desks are made of hard oak and have seating for groups of two or three students. There are two doors: a front door that leads to the Cathedral of Learning s third-floor corridor and a symbolic back door for aesthetic purposes that faces Heinz Memorial Chapel. In the Hall of Enlightenment the back door would have led to the Sungkyunkwan s courtyard. The Korean Heritage Classroom will be the first of Pitt s Nationality Rooms to be equipped with state-of-the-art technology. Devices include an 85-inch Samsung 3D monitor along with Wi-Fi connection and four centrally placed speakers. Such technology will be standard in the construction of future Nationality and Heritage Classrooms. The Korean Heritage Classroom s dedication is the culmination of more than eight years of work by Pitt administrators citizens donors government officials and Classroom Wall DecorationClassroom Wall Decorationsupporters in both the United States and South Korea. Following official approval by then-Chancellor Nordenberg in the fall of 2007 a seven-year international fundraising campaign raised more than $850000 in donations. The classroom s building materials were procured and crafted in various regions of South Korea and shipped to Pittsburgh during the spring of 2015. Throughout the summer Korean artisans and craftsmen who specialize in traditional Korean architecture assembled the materials within room 304 of the Cathedral of Learning. Construction continued throughout the fall semester and was completed in late October. Established in 1926 by then-Chancellor John Bowman Pitt s Nationality Rooms are representative of and pay tribute to the cultural groups that settled Allegheny County. The classrooms are located on the first and third floors of the Cathedral of Learning and are used as functioning classrooms. Pitt s Nationality Rooms are maintained and supported through a partnership between the local populations of these cultural groups and the University of Pittsburgh. ### 11/2/15/amm/klf/jm,Pitt Korean Festival1756412,dpxfhlytlbxb,995195,Brookline Library ,Pittsburgh, 708-710 Brookline Blvd.,-80.02137,40.394427,socializing,Musicians; Singles; Watching Movies; Live Music; Nightlife; Language & Culture; Social; Outdoors; Fun Times; Adventure; Artists; Volunteering; Writing; Performing Arts; Theater; Fun and Free; ,"Board games are provided feel free to bring your favorites.

Carey (John Wentworth Professor Department of Government Dartmouth College)Date: Wednesday September 9 2015Time: 4:00 p.m.Location: 332 Cathedral of LearningWhat difference does it make if the state makes people vote? The question is central to normative debatesabout the rights and duties of citizens in a democracy and to contemporary policy debates in a variety ofcountries over what actions states should take to encourage electoral participation. By focusing on a rarecase of abolishing compulsory voting in Venezuela this study shows that not forcing people to voteyields a more unequal distribution of income. The evidence supports Arend Lijphart s claim advanced inhis 1996 presidential address to the American Political Science Association that compulsory voting canoffset class bias in turnout and in turn contribute to the equality of influence.Refreshments will be provided.For more information contact: Anibal P rez-Li n at [masked] orLuz Amanda Hank at [masked]Sponsored by the Center for Latin American Studies and the Department of Political Science at theUniversity of Pittsburgh.

Gretz has graciously invited us to Pittsburgh Mass Mob his gorgeous All Saints Church appropriately on November 1 on All Saints Day! All Saints parish was founded in 1902 to serve the Catholic community of Etna. The first pastor was appointed in April 1902 and work began on a new church in the summer of 1902 on Wilson St. This first church a frame building was dedicated on August 3 1902. Due to the growth of the congregation the church building quickly became inadequate to meet the needs of the parish. Rather than tear down the church however the parish moved it to another part of its property and built a new church on the site of the old church. Groundbreaking began in September 1914 and the finished church was dedicated on December 19 1915. This church continues to serve the pastoral needs of Etna Catholics. On September 17 2004 flooding in Etna caused by tropical storm Ivan damaged the church. The flood waters damaged the floor and wiring of the building. The church was closed for six months for repair. During this time Mass was celebrated in the parish activities building. The church reopened on March 19 2005. This church is truly gorgeous from its stunning stained glass windows to even the structure of the building itself.. you feel that you have somehow wandered into a charming European village when you see this church It is amazing.,Pittsburgh Mass Mob XVI at the gorgeous All Saints in Etna PA!1756412,226739385,1154790,First United Methodist Church,Pittsburgh, 5401 Centre Avenue,-79.938581,40.455928,socializing,Musicians; Singles; Watching Movies; Live Music; Nightlife; Language & Culture; Social; Outdoors; Fun Times; Adventure; Artists; Volunteering; Writing; Performing Arts; Theater; Fun and Free; ,All are welcome to attend a free Community Thanksgiving Dinner.

Her voice and writing have drawn comparisons to female musicians such as Corinne Bailey Rae Regina Spektor Norah Jones and Fiona Apple but her percussive piano-playing and soaring vocals give homage to her African upbringing. Leaving her career as a publicist in 2008 Ike has since played well over 1000 shows and has had the opportunity to share the stage and open for Jeffrey Gaines Cody Chestnutt Denison Whitmer Deas Vail Butterfly Boucher Serena Ryder Tyrone Wells Najee Allen Toussaint Seth Glier and Ken Whitely &amp; The Levy Sisters to name a few. She has been named WYEP s Artist of the Year (2013) Pittsburgh City Paper s Independent Artist of the Year on countless past occasions and performed in many established venues both locally and nationally. Ike s path has consistently taken an \'anywhere-for-anyone\' approach playing for intimate audiences in coffeehouse universities house concerts churches and small theater settings. A write-up on NPR\'s ""All Things Considered"" says ""The depth of subjects she tackles in her poetic lyrics are perfectly complemented by a unique blend of neo-soul with just the right dash of pop... a truly compelling act to watch in person with the ability to create an intimate setting in locations big and small.""

A Walk a Mile in Her Shoes Event is a playful opportunity for men to raise awareness in their community about the serious causes effects and remediations to men\'s sexualized violence against women. There is an old saying: ""You can\'t really understand another person\'s experience until you\'ve walked a mile in their shoes."" Walk a Mile in Her Shoes asks men to literally walk one mile in women\'s high-heeled shoes. It\'s not easy walking in these shoes but it\'s fun and it gets the community to talk about something that\'s really difficult to talk about: gender relations and men\'s sexualized violence against women. Pittsburgh is joining in with a ""Walk"" in Bloomfield. The walk will take you through the main drag from one end of Bloomfield to the other.

SHARED EXPERIENCES DRAW PEOPLE TOGETHER. SHARE A BOOK. SHARE AN EXPERIENCE. Shared experiences draw people together. That is why Pitt Public Health is continuing the One Book One Community (OBOC) program for a seventh year. Everyone in the school community is invited to join together in reading and discussing: Dreamland: The True Tale of America s Opiate Epidemic by Sam Quinones. ABOUT THE BOOK In fascinating detail Sam Quinones chronicles how over the past 15 years enterprising sugar cane farmers in a small county on the west coast of Mexico created a unique distribution system that brought black tar herointhe cheapest most addictive form of the opiate 2 to 3 times purer than its white powder cousinto the veins of people across the United States. Communities where heroin had never been seen beforefrom Charlotte NC and Huntington WVA to Salt Lake City and Portland ORwere overrun with it. Local police and residents were stunned. How could heroin long considered a drug found only in the dense urban environments along the East Coast and trafficked into the United States by enormous Colombian drug cartels be so incredibly ubiquitous in the American heartland? Who was bringing it here and perhaps more importantly why were so many townspeople suddenly eager for the comparatively cheap high it offered? With the same dramatic drive of El Narco and Methland Sam Quinones weaves together two classic tales of American capitalism: The stories of young men in Mexico independent of the drug cartels in search of their own American Dream via the fast and enormous profits of trafficking cheap black-tar heroin to America\'s rural and suburban addicts; and that of Purdue Pharma in Stamford Connecticut determined to corner the market on pain with its new and expensive miracle drug Oxycontin; extremely addictive in its own right. Quinones illuminates just how these two stories fit together as cause and effect: hooked on costly Oxycontin American addicts were lured to much cheaper black tar heroin and its powerful and dangerous long-lasting high. Embroiled alongside the suppliers and buyers are DEA agents local small-town sheriffs and the US attorney from eastern Virginia whose case against Purdue Pharma and Oxycontin made him an enemy of the Bush-era Justice Department ultimately stalling and destroying his career in public service. Dreamland is a scathing and incendiary account of drug culture and addiction spreading to every part of the American landscape.{excerpt from book synopsis from Amazon.com} WHERE TO GET THE BOOK Books can be purchased at a 10% discount at the University Bookstore on Fifth by showing your Pitt ID The book is also available from Pitt\'s Hillman Library and from the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh both as a traditional book and as an e-book download for Kindle Overdrive and EPUB format.

Every month we suggest a topic - some are clear cut like spooky tales for Halloween or books adapted to the cinema; others are a little more open to interpretation. This is one of the latter. It is always the case that you choose the title and you share your thoughts with a fellowship of readers who share your interest in literature. At its simplest you read a book and you come and share it with us. Show and Tell-style. Easy. BYOB: Long Distance Dedications is a chance to read a title of either your choosing or a person of your choice. Read a book with a friend or family member who lives afar from our Someplace Special. If you like and it is an option invite your partner to share in the experience - via Skype or FaceTime. This can be a great opportunity to share your book club experience with someone you love - an out-of-state friend or a long-distance love affair a sibling or parent across the country a military spouse deployed abroad. Choose well friend... we\'re reading for two. The title selection can be anything - classic or contemporary literature non-fiction biographies... so long as both you and your loved one share in the experience. And if this little twist doesn\'t appeal to you... it\'s always cool to arrive stag your friendly neighborhood book club is always your best Plus One. Cheers!

Finding Margo Losing Gus draws its inspiration from the work of bestselling author John Green whose Young Adult novels portray teens struggling to make sense out of life and answer the big questions from learning to empathize to dealing with tragedy loss and the realities of life. Green s best known novel The Fault in Our Stars deals with sixteen-year-old cancer survivors confronting their own mortality and attempting to love and support each other with the little time they have left. Geeksdanz s production jumps into the space between Green s four novels to explore both the similarities between characters and the diversity of relationships with particular focus on the un-romanticized reality of so-called romantic relationships and the idea that being there to support your partner in everyday problems is sometimes more important than physical attraction.

A handwritten document from the Blessed Saint Leibowitz that read: pound pastrami can kraut six bagels bring home for Emma. Winner of the 1961 Hugo Award for Best Novel A Canticle for Leibowitz is a chilling and provocative look at a post-apocalyptic future. Beginning with the discoveries of a society of cloistered monks dedicated to the study and preservation of relics of the blessed Saint Isaac Leibowitz the story spans centuries following the progression of civilization from the remains of nuclear devastation to the rediscovery of scientific knowledge and inevitable repeat of past mistakes. At once serious funny tragic violent touching and barbaric it s a powerful and enduring work of modern speculative fiction that will stay with you long after you close the book.

It\'s not so much that we want you to get stuffed with the worst worst but rather pick a sampling of your best worst reads.

However if you want to stay with the classics or a short stories collection so be it. Or if you want to celebrate the holidays with a nod to your heritage or family or food. Fine.

Armada is due to be released July 14th. From Amazon: Zack Lightman has spent his life dreaming. Dreaming that the real world could be a little more like the countless science-fiction books movies and videogames he s spent his life consuming. Dreaming that one day some fantastic world-altering event will shatter the monotony of his humdrum existence and whisk him off on some grand space-faring adventure. But hey there s nothing wrong with a little escapism right? After all Zack tells himself he knows the difference between fantasy and reality. He knows that here in the real world aimless teenage gamers with anger issues don t get chosen to save the universe. And then he sees the flying saucer. Even stranger the alien ship he s staring at is straight out of the videogame he plays every night a hugely popular online flight simulator called Armada in which gamers just happen to be protecting the earth from alien invaders. No Zack hasn t lost his mind. As impossible as it seems what he s seeing is all too real. And his skills as well as those of millions of gamers across the world are going to be needed to save the earth from what s about to befall it. It s Zack s chance at last to play the hero. But even through the terror and exhilaration he can t help thinking back to all those science-fiction stories he grew up with and wondering: Doesn t something about this scenario seem a little familiar? At once gleefully embracing and brilliantly subverting science-fiction conventions as only Ernest Cline could Armada is a rollicking surprising thriller a classic coming of age adventure and an alien invasion tale like nothing you ve ever read before one whose every page is infused with the pop-culture savvy that has helped make Ready Player One a phenomenon.,Armada by Ernest Cline1769932,225436968,3814592,AMC Loews Waterfront 22,West Homestead, 300 Waterfront Drive West,-79.918976,40.407063,literature-writing,Coffee; Dining Out; Book Club; Social; Fiction; Fun Times; Reading; FUN FUN FUN; Pubs and Bars; Exploring New Restaurants; Adventures in Dining; , The plan is to see The Martian at the Waterfront and find a place to talk about the movie and book afterward (reading the book is optional).

Now the seven books of nonfiction that appeared between 1968 and 2003 have been brought together into one thrilling collection. Slouching Towards Bethlehem captures the counterculture of the sixties its mood and lifestyle as symbolized by California Joan Baez Haight-Ashbury. The White Album covers the revolutionary politics and the ""contemporary wasteland"" of the late sixties and early seventies in pieces on the Manson family the Black Panthers and Hollywood. Salvador is a riveting look at the social and political landscape of civil war. Miami exposes the secret role this largely Latin city played in the Cold War from the Bay of Pigs through Watergate. In After Henry Didion reports on the Reagans Patty Hearst and the Central Park jogger case. The eight essays in Political Fictions -on censorship in the media Gingrich Clinton Starr and ""compassionate conservatism"" among others-show us how we got to the political scene of today. And in Where I Was From Didion shows that California was never the land of the golden dream.

It seems a bit more dark than the choices from previous years and I thought that would be fun. It also seems to be a relatively short read. Synopsis (abridged from Amazon): Visitors call seldom at Blackwood House. Taking tea at the scene of a multiple poisoning with a suspected murderess as one\'s host is a perilous business. For a start the talk tends to turn to arsenic. ""It happened in this very room and we still have our dinner in here every night"" explains Uncle Julian continually rehearsing the details of the fatal family meal. ""My sister made these this morning"" says Merricat politely proffering a plate of rum cakes fresh from the poisoner\'s kitchen. We Have Always Lived in the Castle is full of a macabre and sinister humor and Merricat herself its amiable narrator is one of the great unhinged heroines of literature. Merricat has developed an idiosyncratic system of rules and protective magic burying talismanic objects beneath the family estate nailing them to trees ritually revisiting them. But when a stranger arrives he disturbs the sisters\' careful habits installing himself at the head of the family table unearthing Merricat\'s treasures. Unable to drive him away by either polite or occult means Merricat adopts more desperate methods. Jackson\'s novel emerges less as a study in eccentricity and more as a powerful critique of the anxious ruthless processes involved in the maintenance of normality itself. ""Poor strangers"" says Merricat contentedly at last studying trespassers from the darkness behind the barricaded Blackwood windows. ""They have so much to be afraid of.""

The church\'s Romanesque style was designed by architect John T. Comes [masked]) for the firm Rutan and Russell. Comes also designed Saint John the Baptist Church also in Lawrenceville for the Beezer Brothers architectural firm. Construction for St. Augustine Church began in September of 1899 and was dedicated on May 21 1901. The beautiful stained glass windows are also wonderful pieces of history. They were imported from Munich Germany. The parish has been operated by the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor Capuchin (OFM Cap) since the 1870s when there was a call for German speaking priests put out by Bishop Domenec early in the history of the Diocese of Pittsburgh. There will be a tour of the church immediately following Mass. We can\'t wait for you to witness the beauty of this exquisite example of German Romanesque Catholic Churches in Pittsburgh! Bring your cameras invite family friends and neighbors to help rediscover another one of Pittsburgh\'s hidden gems that deserves to be a part of our vibrant community once more!

Please join us as we continue the \'Dance Lesson Wine Session\' series at the Pittsburgh Dance Center located in the heart of Bloomfield. This fun evening will start off with an appetizer sampling created by Chef Josh Ross of the newly opened Pan Asian (which is located in the former Tamari space) in Lawrenceville. If you haven\'t been to Pan Asian check out this great review from City Paper http://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/pan-asian-kitchen/Content?oid=1849831 And the Pan Asian website http://www.panasianpgh.com/ Check out the menu that Chef Josh will create for our Dance Lesson Wine Session event! Tempura sweet potato mango avocado maki with smoked habanero mango puree Tempura jalapeno cream cheese cucumber maki with jalapeno miso Pickled vegetable seaweed salad cucumber maki with truffle soy Roasted edamame salad with sesame miso vinagrette Chef Josh may change or add to it but this gives you a general idea for pairing wine and so we would recommend an effervescent white spicy or smokey red or sake. This is a light enough selection that you will feel energetic and ready to dance after! The introductory class in tango will begin at 6:30 PM which will be followed by a break so the group may enjoy more food/wine and socializing. The evening will then continue with general dancing including Latin and ballroom mini-lessons depending on the interests of the group. This event is BYOwine and it is suggested you bring one of your favorite wines or perhaps something you\'ve never tried before. And this time we\'ll have something else to celebrate namely NATIONAL BALLROOM DANCE WEEK taking place during September 18-27 2015. The fun dance lessons will be suitable for beginners with all levels welcome. The doors will open around 6:30 PM so we\'ll have a bit more time for socializing before the first lesson begins. The dance class is only $15 which also includes complimentary appetizer sampling created by Chef Josh Ross of Pan Asian plus a complimentary \'follow up\' beginner dance class voucher for your use after this event. What a great deal!! As a reminder this event is BYOwine which has been so popular in the past as guests have a chance to try so many different wines! Please wear something fun and comfortable such as dressy casual to cocktail wear! With so many people in the Meetup sometimes it can be challenge meeting/mingling especially for relatively new members when attending other events at busy art galleries outdoor festivals and performances at large venues such as the Benedum. So perhaps a series of fun activities that bring lots of people together would also help with introductions and spotting other members at future events. After the first 45-minute lesson people will have the option to continue dancing until around 9:30-10 PM or simply enjoy more wines snacks good conversation and lots of laughs. And there will even be mini-class lessons to some of your favorite beats for those that are interested!! This will be a fantastic event bringing people together Meetup groups PDC clients and dance enthusiasts. This \'Dance Lesson Wine Session\' series has been a lot of fun so having it this time in celebration of NATIONAL BALLROOM DANCE WEEK should be a great time for everyone. While Pittsburgh has a vibrant cultural scene including classical and contemporary dance this is our chance to experience being a bit more than spectators while learning more about the art of dance. Unlike a restaurant where people spend most of the time talking with those seated nearby the \'Dance Lesson Wine Lesson\' will be less formal so people should be able to meet many others while enjoying the group dance lesson and sharing wine. While there are other Meetup groups and organizations in the region that are specifically focused on dance this event is also an opportunity for people to see if they might enjoy taking up dance in a relaxed informal atmosphere. Because some might be more comfortable bringing a friend for the dance lesson guests are certainly welcome. So when you RSVP please indicate if you\'ll bringing one or more friends. This event costs only $15/person please bring cash at the door and is BYOB wine. The $15 includes complimentary appetizer sampling created by Executive Chef Josh Ross of Pan plus a complimentary \'follow up\' beginner class voucher for your use at PDC after this event. What a great deal!!! But to make the wine appreciation session more interesting please feel free to bring one of your favorite bottles of wine or perhaps something you\'ve never tried before with an emphasis on value wines in the $12/bottle range. With the great appetizer menu prepared by Chef Josh we would also recommend an effervescent white spicy or smokey red or sake. For those that live close to the larger state stores this might be a chance to check out one of the Chairmen\'s Selection wines. It would be fantastic if this event included a variety of wines for the group to try. And if you don\'t drink that is certainly OK as this event is about having fun bringing lots of people together and learning a little more about ballroom dance. We hope to see everyone on Sunday September 27!

If you ignore the whistle and show up late to the next bar or without a nametag you may not get the special and you may have to pay the cover to get in. You can get nametags at the first 3 bars. 5. You are responsible for your behavior. If you get drunk it is your own fault not our fault and not the bar\'s. Take a cab home.(We reccommend Classy Cab or UBERX I like going home in a Limo). 6. You are also responsible for the people you invite. If you know someone is a nasty or problem drunk do not invite him..her. The pub-crawl is not the place for him/her to display his/her talents. If you cause a problem you will be asked to leave and so will the person who invited you. We have a good reputation.,Halloween Pub Crawl 2015! ALL Mt.

The format is mostly the same: one of us does a guided meditation we have a brief break if needed and then the other does a complementary meditation. The whole event takes about an hour. We have some folding chairs a couch and some cushions to sit on but feel free to bring a mat or something to sit on if you have special needs to ensure they are accommodated. Tea coffee and water are available at the event in the lobby. I am excited to welcome Bob Lardin to be my guest at this month s event. Robert W Lardin Jr. is a former Catholic Deacon and a retired systems analyst. He is currently active at Allegheny General Hospital in the Holistic Medicine program where he practices Reiki. Bob is a certified hypnotherapist a Knight s Templar Reiki Master and is certified in Quantum touch. He enjoys working with all sorts of conditions and situations in the hospital as well as teaching his methods when the opportunity arises. Bob teaches hypnosis Reiki and meditation in his spare time and spends lots of time practicing. I will open the event with a meditation on connecting to the sky and earth energies. We will work on feeling the upward and downward flow of energy in the body which is the foundation for energy work shamanic journeying and many other practices. You will start to notice different aspects of this energy flow during the meditation which has the goal of helping your overall awareness of your field and it s energetic anatomy. After a break following this first meditation you will draw on these flows and this ground work as Bob assists you with a meditation that has roots in the Templar form of Reiki. This second meditation will use oils. Bob will then demonstrate the different forms of energy he works with in Reiki and Quantum Touch and show you how to use these different energies in your meditation practice to heal and create change. The event is $10 pre-registered or $15 at the door. You may send pre-registration or pre-payments to [masked] through paypal.

It has a lot of great things to offer. However when I talk with people about it there are a number of misconceptions. I'd like to dispel some based on what I've learned using kanban for the last 3 years. I'm hoping folks in the audience will share their experiences as well - kanban practitioners are encouraged to attend! Michael's Bio:I started out in engineering back in the mid 90s programming aircraft engine models. I quickly learned I like to build cool stuff but I also like to be lazy. With software I can do both! So in 99 I made the switch and became a software developer. Along the way I realized it isn t all about heads-down coding - the overall process is important. My agile journey began in the early 00s when I picked up some engineering practices from XP. Then I had to lead teams so I learned Scrum. I ve since introduced Scrum to a number of clients. Scrum worked well but it didn t always feel like the right fit. I learned about lean and kanban and transitioned a team to ScrumBan and eventually full kanban. I ve played multiple roles on my journey - developer tester project manager program manager and architect. And I truly enjoy all of them (well maybe not testing so much) because they all get me to my desired end state - building cool stuff.,Kanban: Rumors Myths and Legends by Michael Carpenter1792120,224128785,1685281,Matrix Solutions LLC,Pittsburgh, 901 Pennsylvania Avenue,-80.018265,40.455486,tech,Ruby; Software Development; Extreme Programming; Scrum; Agile Project Management; Test Driven Development; Kanban; Lean Startup; Software QA and Testing; Test Automation; ,Release Planning is Core to Scaling Agile.

For our Star Wars fans we have 3 Imperial Assault events and 2 X-Wing events. Both X-Wing events will have prize support as well as at least one of the Imperial Assault events. Note We continue to receive new event submissions and will be posting RPGA events in the coming weeks so remember to check the registration site for updates.

The #1 suggestion each and every year was the need to have a dealers room at GASPcon and we are delivering on that request. We were able to add-on the enclosed space beside our main hall which we will utilize for both our vendors and demo games. This gives us over 12000 sq ft of space for this purpose. In addition to the dealer the Pennsylvania Coin Operated Gaming Hall of Fame and Museum will be attending this year and will have 2 games available for free play all weekend including the classic dungeon explorer Gauntlet! If you are interested in being a vendor or have a game in development you wish to highlight please check out the following link for our vendor packet. https://dl.dropboxuse...

Artemis isn t an official Star Trek game but it is the Star Trek game you ve always dreamed of. PC Gamer Overall Artemis: Spaceship Bridge Simulator is ridiculously good fun. -Wired Magazine This is such an amazingly simple idea that I can t believe nobody has thought of it until now. Escapist Magazine This is LARPing for science fiction fans with the exception that everything you want to work actually does. You re not pretending to throw spells you re actually telling Engineering to send more power to the shields during a tense standoff.

Tournament please just go through our Join Page: http://PittsburghTennisLeague.com/join *********************** How does the PittsburghTennis Tournament Work? Every Match Counts *NEW* for 2015 Tennis Tournament Basic Concept Our tournaments are a single elimination format with a consolation bracket. Meaning you are guaranteed at least 2 matches. This tournament format will not be played at a single location over a weekend instead players are given 7 to 10 days to play each round\'s match. Our tournaments will be mixed gender unless we have particularly strong female enrollment in a city. The tournaments will be singles based until we receive enough response to open it up for doubles. Players will be grouped in brackets with players no greater than .5 of their current TLN League Rating. Meaning Skilled - 3.0 players will be matched with other 3.0 players and at most with Competitive - 3.5 level players. Competitive - 3.5 level players could be grouped with Advanced - 4.0 players but will not have Elite 4.5 level players in their bracket. Our Guarantee We need at least 6 players to make a tournament bracket. If we can NOT reach this criteria then we will refund your entry fee and give you the next tournament for no cost. Our hope is to run multiple skill level brackets for each tournament. We are NOT going to show early enrollment for the tournaments. Also the 7-day money back guarantee expires as soon as the tournament starts. Tournaments will not allow for late enrollment. Leveling All tournament players will need to have played 4 league/season or tennis ladder legacy matches before they can enter into a tournament. Players will be entered into the tournament that associates with their TLN\'s Player Rating. If a player wants to participate in a second draw at a rating higher than their Player Rating they will be allowed too. Your Schedule and Availability These tournaments will be kicked off on Thursday\'s giving the first round opponents two weekends to play the first match and then each following round will have a full week to play the match. Players need to be local for at least the first 3 weeks after kickoff. Players with 1-week work trips or week long vacations during the first 3 weeks shouldn\'t participate in the tournament. Seedings The PittsburghTennis staff will seed 25% of the participants based veteran status (Most number of matches played in their career) with the program. If we have 8 players enrolled we\'ll seed the top 2 players 16 players the top 4 players. The rest of the players will be randomly entered into the draw. Consolation Bracket We will run a consolation bracket for the players who lost their first match. Seedings for the consolation bracket will be randomly selected by the PittsburghTennis staff. The winner of the consolation bracket will receive a $25 Tennis Warehouse Gift Card. Where to Play? Because the seeding of the tournament is mainly randomize the higher seed will NOT have home court preference. The league strongly suggests you meet half-way to cut the commute in half for both players. We provide an extensive list of tennis courts that have user submitted ratings. If two players need guidance they can certainly email our staff for suggestions. Playing Format The preferred playing format for tournaments should be 2 sets with a 3rd set tie-breaker or 2 out of 3 sets. If the two players can\'t agree the default format will be the 2 sets with a 3rd set tie-breaker. In NYC we will accept 10 game pro set results mainly due to court availability. Target Audience This will be our most competitive format. The target audience is for the player who are good sports and love to play competitive matches. Prize Pool The prize pool will be based upon enrollment in each bracket. A tournament can have multiple brackets. The tournament prize structure is based around our partner Tennis Warehouse (TW). 6 to 10 players: $50 TW Gift Card for the winner* $25 TW GC for Finalist $25 TW GC for Consolation bracket winner11 to 16: $100 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy $50 TW GC for Finalist $25 TW GC for Consolation winner17 to 24: $150 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy $50 TW GC for Finalist $25 TW GC for 3rd &amp; 4th place $50 TW GC for Consolation winner25+: $200 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy $100 TW GC for Finalist $25 TW GC for 3rd and 4th place $50 TW GC for Consolation winner All tournament champions will be receive an entry into the End of the Year National Tourneys at the champions discounted rate.

Because of this PLEASE be certain that you think you can attend before signing up otherwise he will get stuck with the tickets that are held for us and will not be willing to do this again. In other words: No MAYBE\'s should sign up at all. If you are not CERTAIN you can attend please don\'t sign up now. I\'m hoping and my goal is to be able to provide our group with special future events like this again and that is totally dependant on how this first time event goes. Thank-You for cooperation in this matter. Also prices are as follows: ALL TICKETS ARE $10.00 FOR EVERYONE! We will pay cash at the door for them.

Sandra Bullock &amp; Billy Bob Thornton in \'Our Brand Is Crisis\' The thrust of Our Brand Is Crisis is built around an early 2000\'s Bolivian presidential election that pits Bullock\'s ragged underdog Pedro Castillo (played by Joaquim De Almeida) versus Thornton\'s first place candidate. Castillo is so far behind in the polls that it\'s a joke he\'s still running but backing longshots is Jane\'s specialty and she always works best when the gloves are off. The cutthroat political tactics of the real world have been watered down for this fictionalized version but it\'s still entertaining to see both sides waging constitutional war on each other.

You can expect to see: Firing projectiles and knowing where to fire from. Teaching your player how to turn around. Adding random to make the game realistic and interesting. Introduction to simple multiplayer. Deploy to different platforms. - PREPARATION - Download Unity3D Personal Edition. It's free and full featured. Be sure to check out the system requirements. It would be helpful to have a PNG editor like Paint .NET or Gimp or even Photoshop if you have it. It is recommended that you have Visual Studio 2013 or higher. We will be using the Visual Studio Tools for Unity to tie the two together. If you are using VS 2015 you can get the tools from Visual Studio's gaming site. If you are using VS 2013 you can get the tools through the Visual Studio Extensions Manager. You can find the current progress of the game we have been walking through available on github at: https://github.com/swhook52/AdventuresOfFirstName - NOTE - This is a hands on lab.

It is often a requirement for the development process to include unit testing of code when developing it and Team Foundation Server can be configured to ensure unit tests have been created and run successfully prior to checking in the code. User Interface testing however is typically left to the end of the development cycle and performed manually by human testers following scripts to enter data click buttons and interrupt results. This type of testing is of course limited to the availability and skills of those performing the tests and can be tedious and error prone. Fortunately when implementing an ASP.NET MVC solution there is a way to automate the UI testing so tests can be run frequently repeatedly and consistently to identify defects and prevent regression errors. In this article I ll use TestStack s Seleno framework to demonstrate how automated UI testing can be implemented and incorporated into a project.

Welcome GDI PGH and thanks Mosaix! Dynamic Business Rule Validation Across the Web Development Stack with Stefan Vantchev Whether you are a seasoned web developer or relatively new to the game I m sure you will agree that most software applications must continue to change over time along with the changes in the business requirements that the software is to support. In some applications these changes manifest from changes in laws or government regulations or maybe just from an aggressive new marketing strategy that requires the application to now support new sales strategies. In all instances the software applications we build must support these changes in business rules by setting new validation rules that must be evaluated through all layers. With increasing expectations of instantaneous response times we should be providing front end validation but we can t forget the importance of securing our APIs and of course the database. In this discussion we ll talk about the tools we use to support dynamic business rule validation through AngularJS C# using Fluent Validators and SQL server. We are also very interested to know how others have tackled this issue in their applications so that we can all learn some new techniques together. About Stefan Vantchev Stefan Vantchev has been designing and developing software for over 14 years. His architectural and development background ranges from embedded software to enterprise-level SaaS and desktop applications to data-visualization solutions for a plethora of industries. Stefan has extensive experience with most of the iterations of the .Net framework with most recent interests including AngularJS WebAPI NoSql Dependency Injection and code modularization.

Whether you are looking for work or looking for people you can find more information about them at http://www.oxfordsolutionsinc.com Abstract The actor model is an approach to designing concurrent systems that has been around since the early 70's but is gaining more popularity today. Being a message-based approach the actor model fits nicely when building out transactional or multi-step workflow process systems. Message-driven actor systems take a lot of the complexity away and allow you to create small classes (actors) that handle very specific tasks. These actors are coordinated via the passing of immutable messages which allows your system to scale out if needed. In this talk we ll look at a popular .NET actor system Akka.NET and through several simple examples show you how to get started building scalable message-driven solutions.

Basically I will be available in the shop during an hour to an hour and a half one evening a month in order to take questions and have an open discussion on a pre-chosen topic for that time period. We wanted to do something different and maybe a little new age-y and talk about rocks and such. I\'m going to bring my stones and show you how they are used in my practice for mediation journeying and healing work including the stones I used in my successful recovery from several feminine disorders. I will also share with you how some of these rocks were used in ancient medicine and healing practices and how some are used today. A friend of mine Dan happens to be a rock person and is going to bring some of his favorites to talk about too. Joyce has many varieties of some of these stones in shop for sale if you would like to take them home (and she\'s incredibly reasonable so I often buy stones here). This is going to be as interactive as you want it to be; you will have the ability to work with these stones if you choose to but nothing will be forced on you in the least. If we can answer your questions we will. If we don\'t know the answer I\'ll point you in the direction you need to go either towards a practitioner or towards a book. This event is being offered without charge in the interest of building a healthy community but if you\'d like to support my work and the shop donations are happily accepted.

Our guest speaker is Doug Raible. Doug is an investor who has experience in wholesaling rehabbing and buy and holds. He is also involved in the financial planning field. Here\'s a message from Doug himself: ""We will be discussing the benefits of financial planning and how you can use certain financial strategies to compliment your real estate ventures. Whether you are an agent contractor business owner or landlord this is an important conversation to have. When you add debt through real estate (good debt) who in your family would inherit that responsibility if something happened to you? You pay a lot of taxes whether it\'s to the state feds sales tax or capital gains tax. Wouldn\'t you like to be invested in something that\'s tax free? As a business owner no one is matching contributions to an 401K or providing employee benefits so it becomes necessary for you to do that yourself. Let me help you find out how."" ""This is coming from a fellow real estate professional and business owner. I will be revealing my secrets on how I mix the real estate world and finance world to my advantage!""

You should bring a computer - this is a hands on lab! I have provided software and walk-throughs for Windows Mac and Linux machines (Be sure to read the README.md files - they look best via the web). 2. If you can clone a branch of my github repo prior to the event you will have a huge head start. See instructions under Appendix A. Beware that this branch is being modified frequently and I will send an email to all RSVP'd members when it is ready for prime time. 3. If you cannot clone my github repo prior to the event don't worry! I will have USB flash drives with all of the information to pass around at the event. 4. If you plan to compete in the competition please check out the competition folder. The password dumps for this will be pushed out live at the beginning of the event. Feel free to click around on the branch and let me know of anything broken. It has undergone a fair amount of remodeling over time and I'm sure there is more than one typo and broken link laying around. Be careful to stay on the branch as I have not yet merged the branch into master and you will encounter unexpected problems. Appendix A - How to clone a github branch1. Install git (instructions). 2. Run the following command in the directory where you'd like the lab materials (This works on Mac Windows (via the Git Shell) and Linux): mkdir SCIS_Password_Lab ; cd SCIS_Password_Lab ; git clone -b Password-Cracking_[masked] single-branch https://github.com/JonZeolla/Presentation_Materials ; cd Presentation_Materials 3.

If you ignore the whistle and show up late to the next bar or without a nametag you may not get the special and you may have to pay the cover to get in. You can get nametags at the first 3 bars. 5.

You are also responsible for the people you invite. If you know someone is a nasty or problem drunk do not invite him..her. The pub-crawl is not the place for him/her to display his/her talents. If you cause a problem you will be asked to leave and so will the person who invited you. We have a good reputation.,Halloween Pub Crawl 2015! ALL Mt.

The details of the crime are slow to surface as Geraldine Coutts is traumatized and reluctant to relive or reveal what happened either to the police or to her husband Bazil and thirteen-year-old son Joe. In one day Joe\'s life is irrevocably transformed. He tries to heal his mother but she will not leave her bed and slips into an abyss of solitude. Increasingly alone Joe finds himself thrust prematurely into an adult world for which he is ill prepared. While his father who is a tribal judge endeavors to wrest justice from a situation that defies his efforts Joe becomes frustrated with the official investigation and sets out with his trusted friends Cappy Zack and Angus to get some answers of his own. Their quest takes them first to the Round House a sacred space and place of worship for the Ojibwe. And this is only the beginning... The Round House won the National Book Award for fiction. One of the most revered novelists of our time Louise Erdrich has produced a work that is riveting and suspenseful. The Round House is a page-turning masterpiece of literary fiction at once a powerful coming-of-age story a mystery and a tender moving novel of family history and culture.,_The Round House_ by Louise Erdrich7946662,224824151,8383092,Schenley Park Cafe,Pittsburgh, 101 Panther Hollow Road,-79.946861,40.438229,literature-writing,Classic Books; Book Club; Literature; Reading; Readers; Books and Drinks; Coffee & Books; ,"From Goodreads:""Sherman Alexie is one of our most gifted and accomplished storytellers and a treasured writer of huge national stature.

In spare poetic prose he portrays a soaring spirit of hope that triumphs over heartbreak trauma and insurmountable struggles. A timely must-read. Library Journal Starred Review beautifully written and morally challenging The Atlantic Monthly Best Books of 2012 A dreamy postapocalyptic love letter to things of beauty big and small: a twitching trout a can of Sprite empathy sex decency and a good dog Gillian Flynn author of Gone Girl Beautifully narrated . . . a book that will surprise you. . . . Hig is a charmer a man of his word with a wicked sense of humor and an acute sense of survival. His eyes are open to the world as only a poet s can be observing and absorbing any beauty left in the aftermath of the world s tragedy. . . . The author shocks readers with unexpected bursts of action-packed scenes that keep the book moving at a suspenseful pace a book that rests easily on shelves with Dean Koontz Jack London or Hemingway. The Missourian The prose bears an obvious debt to manly sentence-smiths like McCarthy Hemingway and Jack London but it also has lyrical descriptions of landscape and nature reminiscent of James Dickey s poetry it s always exhilarating (and quite rare) to see a journalist forgo familiar ground for the uncharted territory of fiction and make such a brilliant success of it. John Seabrook The New Yorker Heller s voice is extraordinary and his narrator s toughness seems to hide a beautiful and aching restlessness. One of those books that makes you happy for literature. Junot D az The Wall Street Journal The Dog Stars is simply superb an emotive and powerful novel in a refreshingly original style breath-taking. SFBOOK.COM Decisively strikes at the ever-arching desire to know what makes us human . Gruff tormented and inspirational Heller has the astonishing ability to make you laugh cringe and feel ridiculously vulnerable throughout the novel One of the most powerful reads in years. Playboy this novel perhaps the world s most poetic survival guide reads as if Billy Collins had novelized one of George Romero s zombie flicks. From start to finish Heller carries the reader aloft on graceful prose intense action and deeply felt emotion.

Unburdened by the material necessities of the more fortunate the denizens of Cannery Row discover rewards unknown in more traditional society. Henry the painter sorts through junk lots for pieces of wood to incorporate into the boat he is building while the girls from Dora Flood s bordello venture out now and then to enjoy a bit of sunshine. Lee Chong stocks his grocery with almost anything a man could want and Doc a young marine biologist who ministers to sick puppies and unhappy souls unexpectedly finds true love. Cannery Row is just a few blocks long but the story it harbors is suffused with warmth understanding and a great fund of human values. ***NB: written in 1945 so not exactly a modern portrayal of women but still worth reading.,Cannery Row by John Steinbeck9759622,225207168, No venue,,,,,,community-environment,Environment; New Urbanism; Farmers Market; Green Living; Sustainable Energy; Sustainability; Eco-Conscious; Green Building; Energy Efficiency; Natural Organic Living; Environmental Awareness; Going Green; Sustainable Development; Green Home Design & Living & Landscaping; Sustainable Architecture Art & Interior Design; ,"The Oct. 1 Biophilia: Pittsburgh meeting will feature Dr. Joylette Portlock president of Communitopia who will introduce the discussion topic ""Climate Change and the Power of a Positive Message.""

Nature provides many emotional spiritual and health benefits to residents of cities. Biophilia argues that we have co-evolved with nature and that we have a deep need to affiliate with the natural world. But how can that connection to nature happen in in an increasingly urbanized world? And what are the other ways that cities can co-exist with nurture and care for nature both local and global? Timothy Beatley will argue that we need to shift towards a vision of biophilic cities and will describe some of the things that emerging leaders and partner cities are doing in this arena. Timothy Beatley has taught in the Department of Urban and Environmental Planning School of Architecture at the University of Virginia for the last 28 years. He is the author or co-author of more than fifteen books on these subjects including Green Urbanism: Learning from European Cities (recently translated into Chinese) Native to Nowhere: Sustaining Home and Community in a Global Age andBiophilic Cities: Integrating Nature Into Urban Design and Planning.

In this presentation ecologist Dr. Johnson will discuss her recently completed dissertation research in Baltimore Md. and the development of the West Baltimore Wildflower Project a collaborative long-term vacant lot restoration experiment using native meadow seed mixes.

Perhaps more than any other natural history subjects birds help connect people with nature and ornithology has a long history of contribution by citizen scientists. In 2013 Mulvihill brought the Smithsonian Institution\'s Neighborhood Nestwatch project to Pittsburgh. He and his crew study the impacts of urbanization on a selection of common songbird species northern cardinal American robin song sparrow black-capped or Carolina chickadee gray catbird northern mockingbird Carolina wren and house wren through annual summer visits to nearly 150 backyards in the Greater Pittsburgh area including the backyard bird habitat of Phipps\' executive director Richard V. Piacentini. Mulvihill will talk about this and the National Aviary\'s other research and conservation projects. Robert S. Mulvihill is a native Pittsburgher who has been an active member of the birding and bird conservation community for more than thirty years. He received a B.S. in Education from the University of Pittsburgh and an M.S. in Biology from Indiana University of Pennsylvania.

Our Dues have tripled it now costs NO MONEY!!! to go on crawls. Our Old dues= 0 $ so 0 x 3 = 0$ Remember we are doing this for the hell of it!!! Occasionally we do a CHARITY BAR CRAWL any donation is okay including not donating you cheap bastard ;-) 3. It is good to tip; it is not so good to assume you know the best place to put the bills. 4. If you ignore the whistle and show up late to the next bar or without a nametag you may not get the special and you may have to pay the cover to get in. You can get nametags at the first 3 bars. 5. You are responsible for your behavior. If you get drunk it is your own fault not our fault and not the bar's. Take a cab home.(We reccommend Classy Cab or UBERX I like going home in a Limo). 6. You are also responsible for the people you invite. If you know someone is a nasty or problem drunk do not invite him..her. The pub-crawl is not the place for him/her to display his/her talents. If you cause a problem you will be asked to leave and so will the person who invited you. We have a good reputation.,Halloween Pub Crawl 2015! ALL Mt.

The MEETUP you have all been waiting for! Well maybe not but it should still be a fantastic time. The old coke mine/railroad/Turnpike town of Irwin opens it's main thoroughfare to artists musicians and spectators. The town offers abundant opportunities for unique and interesting compositions. There are Victorian homes alongside older brick structures eerie but safe alleyways plenty of churches people and music... ah music. The date on the following website is wrong. It is on Thursday August 20th. http://irwinborough.org/art-and-jazz-night.php The Norwin Art League has graciously and enthusiastically offered their building (right in the middle of all of the action) as our meeting point. For anyone who would like to come earlier (bands start at 5:00) and peruse a bit there are a number of great restaurants in town and a few within a 5min. ride that I could recommend. Also I am proposing grabbing an adult beverage or two after our sketching at 8:30.There is no shortage of watering holes. I tried to look at bus info... but all that I can tell anyone is that PAT and Westmoreland Transit have routes that come through Irwin but I'm not sure of the times. Irwin Main St. and Pennsylvania Ave would be the ideal stop. Any bus traveling from Pittsburgh to Latrobe Mt. Pleasant and/or Greensburg should pass by that stop.

Fantastic meetup we had on Friday night we had gamers actively playing games until nearly 2:00 AM! Plus I think we had at least 15 people show up plus we got to give Karl a nice sendoff as he departs for his new life adventure in Maine. Due to the large number of people who showed up we generally had three groups going at the same time. Opening the evening we had a games of Troyes Cabo and I got to teach one of my new games New York 1901. Then played a little filler game called Dead Man's Draw a little pirate themed card game that was a blast to play while waiting for my dinner to arrive. All three groups finished their first game roughly around the same time and we decided break ranks and change group members. We then broke out one of our groups favorite games Roll for the Galaxy while I taught Ticket to Ride a couple of new players and I think the last game that was played was Murano. For the final three games of the night my group played an epic game of Trajan which saw the lead change hands consistently throughout the entire game with the winner being decided in a tie breaker. The other two groups played one of my all-time favorite games Five Tribes w/expansion and the last group played a four player game of Castles of Burgundy. I am making it my goal this week to get my new game La Granja to the table but will be bringing some of my other favorites like King of New York Francis Drake Five Tribes and Concordia with me. If you were interested in teaching a game please bring it along I'm sure you'll find someone that would like to play with you. Just a note if you can't make it at start time people come and go throughout the night so stop by anytime you can make it. You might have to wait a little bit for the next game to start but you could always order some food or have some coffee and dessert while you wait. I won't be able to support nearly as many meetups as Karl but I will still try to continue my biweekly Friday Night under the Lights event. If anyone else is interested in hosting meet ups for the Western PA Gaming group please email me and we can examine other dates and venues to host these events.

Great turnout for last week's Friday Night under the Lights! We did have a little setback in that King's informed us that they are no longer open 24 hours any longer and would be shutting down at 11:00 PM on Fridays. This is a bit of a disappointment since most of our meetup had been going to around 2:00 AM or so. We are going to start the investigation process to see if we can find a suitable place to accommodate the group that stays open a few hours longer. Due to the large crowd we immediately broke up into two groups and played: Above and Below and The Builders. a After those games broke up one group kept up the deckbuilder theme and played Ascension while the other group played a six player game of Mission: Red Planet. With only an hour remaining until closing we split up again and played Codenames and Roll for the Galaxy. 11:00 PM came way too soon but we all had a great time. This week's theme is: Cult of the New bring that new acquisition disorder game that you have purchased but haven't gotten onto the table yet. Maybe someone in the group has played it before and can show you how to play or you can read up on the rules and teach it yourself to the group. My game that I will be instructing this week is: Champions of Midgard this is a viking themed worker placement game similar to one of my favorites Lord of Waterdeep. Please r.s.v.p. early so I have an idea on how many people or coming and what games to bring along. You can always cancel your r.s.v.p. if you have a change of plans. See you on Friday!

Another great meetup last Friday night! The evening started off with a kind of an Indiana Jones explorer type of theme. We played a quick game of Escape: the curse of the temple which is a quick ten minute dice chucker coop where we got slaughtered! Then the group sat down for a five player game of the Relic Runners that had the players exploring temples for different types of ancient relics and trying to score the most points. After Relic Runners we pulled out of my collection one of my new games called Stockpile this game also plays five players and it's a stock market trading game with unique mechanic where each player has a certain piece of insider information. Fast Eddie cornered the market with the electric company stock which managed to split once and increase its value substantially and wound up winning the game by about 30000 dollars. After finishing Stockpile we had a some players leave and some new new players join in the fun. Eddie introduced us to a game called Cabo. After trailing most of the game I had thought I had pulled out a remarkable upset victory until Eddie pulls manages to hit this obscure rule where if you score exactly 100 points your score is halved back to 50 points and he ended up winning the game. Fun little card game that I might have to pick up for the family to play. I still have a couple of new games that I haven't manage to play yet that I would like to get on the table to include: New York 1901 La Granja and King of New York. I am also looking to get Francis Drake or Concordia back to the table soon but open to play most games. If you were interested in teaching a game please bring it along I'm sure you'll find someone that would like to play with you. Just a note if you can't make it at start time people come and go throughout the night so stop by anytime you can make it. You might have to wait a little bit for the next game to start but you could always order some food or have some coffee and dessert while you wait.

So as to avoid confusing folks I am not you usual host Russ! Nope it's your friendly neighborhood Redbeard stepping in to do the hosting in his stead for this one night. He is needed elsewhere. We hope to return your regularly scheduled Russ to you very soon. We had a great meetup of 9 or 10 guests the last Friday night that we played where our feature game was that classic American theme-heavy style game Cosmic Encounter (FFG) where folks invaded neighboring worlds of the other galactic empires and establish a greater number of colonies on opposing homeworlds than their opponents did. Victory went to Russ in one game and another table had game that came right down to the wire between Coleman Matt Wilson and a newcomer Jay. Entirely my fault for not knowing who to give the laurels to on that table. Folks eventually broke out into a game of Viticulture which is a European style game with deep strategies. While that was happening another table tackled games like Roll for the Galaxy Coup Colossal Arena and Neuroshima Hex! So it seems keeping plans light and loose is likely the way to go for this meetup. Feel very welcome to come out and bring games that interest you. Chances are you will find some folks will be talked into playing it easily enough. Feel very welcome to make your first visit if you have been watching us from afar. The restaurant will be happy to sell you food there is no admission. There are plenty of folks who are happy to teach games to newcomers no experience required. We want to make more gamers! We have games We know where to find more games. People are tougher to come by and we hope to be a welcoming and friendly face to any who show up. As for an Idea of what games will be handy I can bring: Cabo Pairs Pinochle Machi Koro Legendary: Marvel Deckbuilding Shadows over Camelot Cloud 9 To Court The King Hanabi Pandemic with its On The Brink expansion Condottiere and Pickomino to name a few. But bring your games! No harm to my ego if we play what you bring instead. I want to see you guys! Drop in. We go until the last person gets sick of hanging around.

We all know how hard it is to meet a group of strangers for the first time and it can be a bit intimidating for most people. However we try and make it as accommodating as possible for our new members. We meet in very public places and you are free to come and go as you please. We also try and find games that meet your interests and your skill levels. I would have to say that most people that come once come back again. I think instead of a focus game this week it is going to be a focused theme. This week\'s theme is going to be Deckbuilding Cardgames! This is a great genre and one that we haven\'t brought out too much in our meetups. I will bring the following games with me: Dominion w/Intrique expansion Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin Other popular games include: Ascension Eminent Domain I also plan on having some new expansions for some of my favorite games with me this week as well. Please take a look at my Board Game Geek collection list and if there is anything you want me to bring alone please feel free to drop it in the comments below.

Another great meetup last Friday night were we played our feature game and built a better dystopia in Euphoria! What a game we had five gamers squaring off to gain the most authority and exert their influence on the new world. There were about three of us that had a chance to win the game in the last round but Redbeard pulled off an exciting double move to win the game in a tie breaker! Interesting little worker placement game with a neat bumping mechanic. After that game broke we played a game of 7 Wonders that Mathew won impressively by building a science dynasty! It seems like there was a lot of people traveling last week so hopefully this meetup will be a little better attended so we can get some more games on the tables. This week's feature game will be the space themed classic Cosmic Encounters! Redbeard or Mathew will have to bring their copies since I personally don't own it. Other games that I will bring along with me are... Five Tribes Castles of Mad King Ludwig Viticulture with Tuscany Expansion Francis Drake Dominion Concordia Plus many more brought by our members...

We had another nice turnout and a great game night last week. We got to playtest 3 Little Words a fun word game that got a lot of great feedback. Then we played the drafting game Between Two Cities. The group split into two afterward with one group playing Roll for the Galaxy and Istanbul while the other group played Caverna. I""ll bring some lighter and some heavier games again this week and encourage others to do the same. There have been requests for Tzolkin and Power Grid so I\'ll review the rules for those (and hope to teach better than I did with Caverna if they hit the table- sorry guys!). Also if anyone wants to do a small game of Through the Ages (or if anyone in the group knows it) let me know!

Another great meetup last Friday night that unfortunately I had to miss but Redbeard graciously filled in for me as host. It looks like they played several games of No Thanks! and Dixit. After a few more people arrived they broke into several groups and played Legendary: Marvel Deckbuilder while the other table played Timeline: Discoveries. The final games of the night were a new group favorite Roll For the Galaxy Splendor and several games of Machi Koro. This weeks featured new games will include: Stockpile New York 1901 La Granja and King of New York. Most members of the meetup bring a bag of games with them so it is not unusual to have between 20-40 games on hand for the evening.

Let\'s plan a meetup to discuss where we want this to go; I\'ve heard some say that they are more interested in a lecture format and others say that they\'d like a mix of lecture and coding. I propose that we spent a little time talking about the subsequent 4 or so meetups. Let\'s make it quick - I\'ll bring some pizza and drinks and we\'ll plan for an hour but I\'m happy to let it go long. I\'m suggesting this date Monday 21 September because I\'ve got some travel coming up and I\'d like avoid letting this idle too long. If you\'d like to attend but that date doesn\'t work for you sound off; if we can get a better showing with a different date then I\'ll do my best to accommodate. We\'ll do this at my office at 121 North Main Street Greensburg in the Park Building. It\'s a brick federal-style building with a large parking lot across the street (free parking after 5:00). Head up the steps to the front door the elevator is down the hallway on the left take it to the 3rd floor head right out of the elevator.

Given the breadth of the group\'s comfort level with Java I\'m going to try an introduction to Java through advanced Java talk; I\'ll start out with ""Hello world"" and finish with Function Programming in Java 8. I\'ll spend some time on best practices most of which are applicable to other languages. Then we\'ll rip apart some code from some poor innocent coder who was foolish enough to use a public Git repository. ;) We\'ll look at real code in Eclipse and talk about the Java lifecycle. I\'ll try to keep the lecture to &lt; 45 minutes so we\'ll have plenty of time for Q and A afterwards. I\'m very experienced with Java in very computationally intensive applications and Bob (if we\'re lucky enough to have him join us) spent a large part of his career with Java in distributed environments starting with close to Java 1.0.0 so we\'ll have a pool of Java grok from which to draw (and you can watch Bob and I fight over indention style). Same place same time. I think that we figured out that 15 is probably the limit at my shop so I\'ll limit to that but I can make other arrangements if there is more interest. Even if you have no interest in Java please try to attend so we can talk about other group-related subjects before we dive in. We\'ll let you leave early.

Dear Friend On August 6 2015 Beaver County resident Art Bell was killed by a motorist while commuting on his bicycle on PA Bike Route A to his workplace. You are most cordially invited to participate in a Memorial Bike Ride and/or Ghost Bike Dedication on Saturday September 12 2015. Family friends fellow cyclists community leaders and the media are all welcome to participate in this dedicatory event. For cyclists the ride begins at 10:00 a.m. at 6000 Woodlawn Rd Aliquippa PA 15001 which is adjacent to the Beaver County Jail. The road ride will traverse approximately 10-miles which includes 5-miles of Bike PA Route A a 55 mph marked highway that is for experienced cyclists only. Police escort and traffic control is provided by local law enforcement. There is also a provision for family members who wish to participate in a short segment of the ride. The Ride with GPS Route map and cue sheet can be found here. For non-cyclist\'s who wish to attend the Ghost Bike Dedication for Arthur Bell please arrive at 632 Cherry Alley South Heights PA 15081 (GPS: [masked] [masked]) around 10:45 a.m. A white painted ""Ghost Bike"" is placed at the collision site as a dignified and somber monument to the victim. The bike serves as a reminder of the avoidable tragedy that occurred on an otherwise anonymous road while conveying a quiet statement in support of cyclists right to safe travel. Arthur Bell is the third fatality in the last 25 months along the Ohio River Trail corridor of PA Bike PA Route A. The community is joining together to honor the memory of Arthur Bell 54 (May 4 1961 - August 6 2015) Taylor Banks 23 (March 24 1991 - October 31 2014) and Emily Jancart 17 (September 7 1995 - July 21 2013). The locations of the deaths are shown on the map below. The Ohio River Trail Council (ORTC) seeks compassion and support to initiate a change in culture that fosters mutual respect among all people who share the road. The roadway design and speeds of PA Route 51 are not compatible with a State Bike Route A designation with speeds often in excess of 65 mph and limited shoulders. See photo below. We call on Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Secretary Cindy Adams Dunn PennDOT Secretary Leslie Richards PennDOT District 11 Executive Dan Cessna and the Pedalcycle &amp; Pedestrian Advisory Committee to expeditiously implement safety improvements along Bike PA Route A from Coraopolis to Monaca Pa. including but not limited to the lowering of speed limits installation of additional share the road signage markings and sharrows. In addition the ORTC respectfully requests the prioritization and funding of the Ohio River Trail Project that parallels this hazardous area of Bike PA Route A which will result in a safer and alternate bikeway. The Ohio River Trail initiative was established in 2009 and progresses at a glacial pace while we incur a cyclist death every eight months. Please join us to show your support to the families of the deceased cyclists and for improved cycling infrastructure. Forwarding this email to your friends and family and sharing on Facebook and other social media is permitted. An Ohio River Trail Council Memorial Ride T-Shirt can be purchased to support the effort to make Bike PA Route A safer for cyclist. Click here to order t-shirt.

Coderetreat? What's that?Coderetreat is a day-long intensive practice event focused on the fundamentals of software development and design.The unique coderetreat format (which eliminates the pressure of 'getting things done' and focuses on practicing basic principles of good design) has proven to be a highly effective (and fun) means of skill improvement. This isn't your ordinary coderetreat: this is the Global Day of Coderetreat!For 32 hours on November 14th coderetreats will be held all over the world as part of the Global Day of Coderetreat.

This year the Global Day of Coderetreat is supporting CoderDojo a worldwide volunteer-driven movement of programming clubs for young people. Over 110 cities are participating! We have a bunch of special things planned. It is going to be a lot of fun! There's some stuff you should bring with youYou need to bring a laptop with the development tools you require to write code using your chosen programming languages. We also recommend you come with a version control system like Git installed. You may also bring an extra keyboard and mouse (to make it easier to pair program). Lunch will be provided.

If you ask a CEO an open-source developer and a computer science professor you\'ll get very different answers. We\'ll take a guided tour of the history of ethical thought and apply it to software development in order to understand how others have defined it and perhaps help to develop your own ethical framework. Along the way we\'ll answer questions such as: What would Nietzsche say about malware developers? How are contracting companies like Moses? Would Kant write closed-source software?

His analysis applies Fiedler\'s method of spectral clustering to the two-way graph of institutional investment holdings as reported in quarterly filings submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. An exhaustive download of these XML-formatted reports is first transformed into a 15000 x 8000 array of ""who owns what"". This matrix is then computationally factored into roughly block-diagonal form where each block represents a niche of equities and the institutions that hold them.

The former Saint Agnes Parish church is the location of this month's Pittsburgh Mass Mob. This parish was formed in 1868 for the growing Oakland community between downtown and the Strip District to the west and East Liberty to the east. This church was dedicated to service in January 1917 and served the parish for 75 years until is was suppressed by the Diocese of Pittsburgh and sold to the Sisters of Mercy at Carlow University. The church was designed by my favorite Pittsburgh architect John Theodore Comes [masked]). It is designed in the Lombardy style that was copied from churches in France and Spain. This tapestry brick stone and concrete edifice sits at the top of the long Fifth Avenue descent into Pittsburgh. For a time is was the location of the Latin (Tridentine) Mass before the diocese closure. The stained glass windows designed by Pittsburgh designer George W. Sotter [masked]) and the richly painted murals painted by Cincinnati native Felix B. Lieftuchter [masked]?) are breathtaking. The high altar side altars communion rail and baptistery are executed in creamy marble with mosaic inlay accents by New York sculptor Henry Schmitt [masked]). Look at the unique and detailed fa ade of the church. The central wheel window has a Calvary group sculpted into it! And the tympanum over all three entrance doors is exquisitely detailed. All this work is the hand of Francis (Frank) Aretz [masked]). His medium is cast concrete rather than stone! Amazing. Every aspect of this church indicates the fine degree of craftsmanship and artistry offered for a House of God. You will want to get here early and linger over the rich detail that abounds this holy place! A tour of the architectural detail of the church will follow the Mass. A reception will follow the Mass at the back of the church. Ample parking is located at two adjacent lots to the left and right of the church along Fifth Avenue and Robinson Street. One restroom is located in the church vestibule (not ADA compliant). No ADA entrance is available to this church (a few steps enter into the priests sacristy side door).,PITTSBURGH MASS MOB XIV14957372,221461720,23727242,Our Lady of the Angels Parish,Lawrenceville Pittsburgh, 225 37th Street,-79.963943,40.465851,religion-beliefs,Catholic; Christian Social; Catholic Singles; Catholic Formation; Catholic Spirtuality; Catholic Young Adults; Young Married Catholics; Catholic prayer and spirituality; Catholic Social; Catholic Professionals; Catholic Social Networking; Catholic Fellowship; Catholic Young Professionals; Catholic Friends; ,Brother John Harvey has graciously allowed the Pittsburgh Mass Mob to visit our gorgeous historic Saint Augustine Catholic Church in the Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh . The church's Romanesque style was designed by architect John T. Comes [masked]) for the firm Rutan and Russell. Comes also designed Saint John the Baptist Church also in Lawrenceville for the Beezer Brothers architectural firm. Construction for St. Augustine Church began in September of 1899 and was dedicated on May 21 1901. The beautiful stained glass windows are also wonderful pieces of history. They were imported from Munich Germany. The parish has been operated by the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor Capuchin (OFM Cap) since the 1870s when there was a call for German speaking priests put out by Bishop Domenec early in the history of the Diocese of Pittsburgh. There will be a tour of the church immediately following Mass. We can't wait for you to witness the beauty of this exquisite example of German Romanesque Catholic Churches in Pittsburgh! Bring your cameras invite family friends and neighbors to help rediscover another one of Pittsburgh's hidden gems that deserves to be a part of our vibrant community once more! You will not be disappointed! We will be welcoming people outside in front of the church. We will have a space for our group to sit in. Please be sure to introduce yourself so that we can give you a name tag.,PITTSBURGH MASS MOB XIII14957372,224753510,24038997,St. Therese of Lisieux Church,Munhall, 1 Saint Therese Ct.,-79.901573,40.387962,religion-beliefs,Catholic; Christian Social; Catholic Singles; Catholic Formation; Catholic Spirtuality; Catholic Young Adults; Young Married Catholics; Catholic prayer and spirituality; Catholic Social; Catholic Professionals; Catholic Social Networking; Catholic Fellowship; Catholic Young Professionals; Catholic Friends; ,Father O'Connor has graciously allowed us to be a part of their Faith Community and help them celebrate their parish's patron saint Saint Therese of Lisieux on October 4 2015 at their 11:00 am Sunday Mass. October 3 1925 the parish of St. Therese of Lisieux was established by Father Joseph D. Hagan. Plans to build a church were halted due to the crash of 1929. After World War II and the revival of the steel plants work once again began in earnest towards the creation of this beautiful church and school. St. Therese of Lisieux School was blessed on August 21 1954. Mass was first celebrated in the basement of this new school until St. Therese of Lisieux Church was finally completed and put into faithful service beginning in 1958. St. Therese of Lisieux Church is a beautiful church with many unique elements that add to the charm of this House of Worship. It contains a unique chapel dedicated to this beloved saint who is called The Little Flower of Jesus . It contains both first and second class relics of this doctor of the Catholic Church made famous in part by her best-selling autobiography The Story of a Soul . It also contains distinct stained glass windows that lovingly tell the stories from both the Old and New Testaments as well as pageants of Pittsburgh scenes honoring the lives of some of the hardworking people that helped make our city what she is today. Just recently St. Therese's church made the news when one of it's bells was repaired and reinstalled. If you would like to see the video honoring this event the link is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGkl-cAqD-Q As you can tell from this video this is truly a fun-loving Faith community! The reason that Father and I chose this date is that this is the Sunday when St. Therese of Lisieux's church celebrates the feast day of their patron saint by finishing their nine-day novena to her as well as hosting a procession outside the church in honor of her. We will be able to partake in this joyous celebration a first for Pittsburgh Mass Mob! Please invite family and friends for this special day. You don't want to miss this one! Elizabeth and your Pittsburgh Mass Mob team ps here is a preview Youtube video of the St. Therese of Lisieux church...enjoy!

Gretz has graciously invited us to Pittsburgh Mass Mob his gorgeous All Saints Church appropriately on November 1 on All Saints Day! All Saints parish was founded in 1902 to serve the Catholic community of Etna. The first pastor was appointed in April 1902 and work began on a new church in the summer of 1902 on Wilson St. This first church a frame building was dedicated on August 3 1902. Due to the growth of the congregation the church building quickly became inadequate to meet the needs of the parish. Rather than tear down the church however the parish moved it to another part of its property and built a new church on the site of the old church. Groundbreaking began in September 1914 and the finished church was dedicated on December 19 1915. This church continues to serve the pastoral needs of Etna Catholics. On September 17 2004 flooding in Etna caused by tropical storm Ivan damaged the church. The flood waters damaged the floor and wiring of the building. The church was closed for six months for repair. During this time Mass was celebrated in the parish activities building. The church reopened on March 19 2005. This church is truly gorgeous from its stunning stained glass windows to even the structure of the building itself.. you feel that you have somehow wandered into a charming European village when you see this church It is amazing. I will be giving more details in the future but mark your calenders today for this exciting opportunity to experience another one of Pittsburgh's historic jewels.,Pittsburgh Mass Mob XVI15074182,225066518,16628452,North Park Boathouse,Allison Park, 10301 Pearce Mill Road,-80.005898,40.605122,parents-family,Moms; Expat Indian; New In Town; Stay-at-Home Moms; Playdates; Working Moms; Social; Babies; Kids; Toddlers; Indian Culture; Couples Night Out; Young Married Couples; ,Families are welcome.

A few meeting ago one of our members mentioned a certain Liberian general during the discussion. Namely Joshua Milton Blahyi or as he is known by another name. I didn\'t know anything about him but the discussion caused me to do some research and its a very fascinating case which would be interesting to discuss. This particular General killed many people during the Liberian civil war in the most horrific and brutal ways you can image in your nightmares. And then he claims he met Jesus repented and is now preaching the gospel all over Liberia as a free man. This brings up an interesting discussion. Something which skeptics often claim as a reason they cannot believe in Jesus. ""How can someone like Hitler repent at the end of his life and go to heaven even though he murdered millions of people?"" Is this fair? Is this justice? Well here is an example where something similar actually happened. I think we will have a very lively discussion about this. First we will watch parts of the following movie in order to become familiar with what happened Disclaimer: Dont Worry I will make sure we don\'t watch any graphic parts although there may be graphic descriptions of what happened there won\'t be any graphic imagery. Its very important to understand how horrific this was to truly appreciate why this redemption is so controversial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLySFPGG7hQ And then we will discuss his case what if this happened in the case of Hitler and other topics related to this. We will use the Bible as our guide and our inherent God given sense of justice.

Our Club is officially 1 years old! Thank you for coming and for the support! What we will do during this meeting Beginning with this meeting we will be starting something new. We will begin watching Theist Vs. Atheist debates of the most famous philosophers and apologists of today and discussing afterwards. Most of these debates are very long. Usually around 2 hours. We will split the debates up into approximately 4 sections and it will take 4 meeting to get through each debate. This will all lead up to the talk by Ravi Zacharias in October at CMU and Pitt which we will attend as a club. The topic Since we have been talking about free will and the problem of evil during the past few meetings we will continue the topic by seeing how two famous philosophers William Lane Craig and Sam Harris handle the question of ""Is God Good?"" Below is a link to the video we will watch. Watch until approximately 30 minutes. This is what we will cover during the meeting. I still need to figure out a proper stopping place such that both speakers had a turn before we discuss. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwcZNWd3iSo The Rules http://ukranians2.wix.com/pgh-apologetics-club#!meetup-group/cwzz We had some problems during past meetings because people failed to follow the rules. People got offended. Remember these are challenging topics. Why don\'t you discuss religion and politics at the dinner table? Because it causes WW3 among your family members. This is a club where we discuss those topics and try to be civil about it. People have different opinions and the only way we will get anywhere is if we respect each other and give each other a fair hearing and DO NOT talk over someone else while they are speaking. Everyone has the same amount of time to speak and no talking over other people. These are the main rules. Lets have fun and learn something together!

The former Saint Agnes Parish church is the location of this month's Pittsburgh Mass Mob. This parish was formed in 1868 for the growing Oakland community between downtown and the Strip District to the west and East Liberty to the east. This church was dedicated to service in January 1917 and served the parish for 75 years until is was suppressed by the Diocese of Pittsburgh and sold to the Sisters of Mercy at Carlow University. The church was designed by my favorite Pittsburgh architect John Theodore Comes. It is designed in the Lombardy style that was copied from churches in France and Spain. This tapestry brick stone and concrete edifice sits at the top of the long Fifth Avenue descent into Pittsburgh. For a time is was the location of the Latin (Tridentine) Mass before the diocese closure. The stained glass windows designed by Pittsburgh designer George W. Sotter and the richly painted murals painted by Cincinnati native Felix B. Lieftuchter are breathtaking. The high altar side altars communion rail and baptistery are executed in creamy marble with mosaic inlay accents by New York sculptor Henry Schmitt. Look at the unique and detailed fa ade of the church. The central wheel window has a Calvary group sculpted into it! And the tympanum over all three entrance doors is exquisitely detailed. All this work is the hand of Francis (Frank) Aretz. His medium is cast concrete rather than stone! Amazing. Every aspect of this church indicates the fine degree of craftsmanship and artistry offered for a House of God. You will want to get here early and linger over the rich detail that abounds this holy place! A tour of the architectural detail of the church will follow the Mass. A reception will follow the Mass at the back of the church. Ample parking is located at two adjacent lots to the left and right of the church along Fifth Avenue and Robinson Street. One restroom is located in the church vestibule (not ADA compliant). No ADA entrance is available to this church (a few steps enter into the priests sacristy side door). ***Greetings to everyone Just to let you know there will be a pre-Mass tour of St. Agnes at 6:15 this Sunday given by our own historian David. Please join us and be sure to bring your cameras for this rare opportunity to experience the beauty and majesty of this church yourself. Be sure to take pictures of the murals behind the altar truly majestic. You can see some of them in the video that I made of St. Agnes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-ZYK-j1JlE There will be a light reception immediately following the Mass in the back of St. Agnes. Since it is a school night they will be closing the church around 8:30 and so that is why they have asked us to hold the tour before 7:00. Thank you to those of you that have signed up. If you know of anyone that attended St. Agnes as a child if you could let them know about this opportunity to go to church there again please feel free to pass this information on to them. Have a wonderful day everyone God bless and happy Mass Mobbing Elizabeth and your Pittsburgh Mass Mob team,Pittsburgh Mass Mob XIV at St. Agnes Center of Carlow University16377642,226491696,22446562,Sparkledragon\'s Magical Emporium,Pittsburgh, 2120 Broadway Ave,-80.03021,40.40442,socializing,Singles; Dining Out; New In Town; Nightlife; Live Music; Social; Fun Times; 20\'s & 30\'s Social; Dancing; Pittsburgh area; 30s and 40s; Cool People; Exercise; Cool Bars; pittsburgh singles; ,"This workshop will give you the introductory basics for doing shadow work a type of psychological transformative work that combines shamanic practice and the psychology Jung developed.

If you ignore the whistle and show up late to the next bar or without a nametag you may not get the special and you may have to pay the cover to get in. You can get nametags at the first 3 bars. 5.

You are also responsible for the people you invite. If you know someone is a nasty or problem drunk do not invite him..her. The pub-crawl is not the place for him/her to display his/her talents.

Gretz has graciously invited us to Pittsburgh Mass Mob his gorgeous All Saints Church appropriately on November 1 on All Saints Day! All Saints parish was founded in 1902 to serve the Catholic community of Etna. The first pastor was appointed in April 1902 and work began on a new church in the summer of 1902 on Wilson St. This first church a frame building was dedicated on August 3 1902. Due to the growth of the congregation the church building quickly became inadequate to meet the needs of the parish. Rather than tear down the church however the parish moved it to another part of its property and built a new church on the site of the old church. Groundbreaking began in September 1914 and the finished church was dedicated on December 19 1915. This church continues to serve the pastoral needs of Etna Catholics. On September 17 2004 flooding in Etna caused by tropical storm Ivan damaged the church. The flood waters damaged the floor and wiring of the building. The church was closed for six months for repair. During this time Mass was celebrated in the parish activities building. The church reopened on March 19 2005. This church is truly gorgeous from its stunning stained glass windows to even the structure of the building itself.. you feel that you have somehow wandered into a charming European village when you see this church It is amazing.,Pittsburgh Mass Mob XVI at the gorgeous All Saints in Etna PA!16377642,226370685,20158732,East End Cooperative Ministry ,Pittsburgh, 6140 Station Street (Penn Circle North) East Liberty,-79.997467,40.438339,socializing,Singles; Dining Out; New In Town; Nightlife; Live Music; Social; Fun Times; 20\'s & 30\'s Social; Dancing; Pittsburgh area; 30s and 40s; Cool People; Exercise; Cool Bars; pittsburgh singles; ,"HALF-PRICE TICKETS still remaining regular price $25.00.

The church's Romanesque style was designed by architect John T. Comes [masked]) for the firm Rutan and Russell. Comes also designed Saint John the Baptist Church also in Lawrenceville for the Beezer Brothers architectural firm. Construction for St. Augustine Church began in September of 1899 and was dedicated on May 21 1901. The beautiful stained glass windows are also wonderful pieces of history. They were imported from Munich Germany. The parish has been operated by the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor Capuchin (OFM Cap) since the 1870s when there was a call for German speaking priests put out by Bishop Domenec early in the history of the Diocese of Pittsburgh. There will be a tour of the church immediately following Mass. We can't wait for you to witness the beauty of this exquisite example of German Romanesque Catholic Churches in Pittsburgh!

Russell JD CG CGL One record says her maiden name was Rankin. Another says it was Pugh. A third says it was Gentry. One record says she was born in Texas; others say she was born in Mississippi. Clearly the evidence we ve gathered in our reasonably exhaustive research is conflicting. Now what? A key element of the Genealogical Proof Standard (GPS) is that we resolve conflicts among evidence items relating to our research question since we can t reach a credible conclusion if conflicting evidence isn t resolved. Sounds good . . . but like so many things that sound good it s easier said than done. What exactly are we supposed to do when we encounter conflicting evidence? What standards are we to follow? In other words how do we do what the GPS tells us to do? This workshop will review the basic types of evidence conflicts and the methods and tips and tricks to use to resolve them.

There an apple tree bearing fruit of magical properties looms over a garden filled with herbs and edible flowers that possess the power to affect in curious ways anyone who eats them. For nearly a decade 34-year-old Claire Waverley at peace with her family inheritance has lived in the house alone embracing the spirit of the grandmother who raised her ruing her mother's unfortunate destiny and seemingly unconcerned about the fate of her rebellious sister Sydney who freed herself long ago from their small town's constraints. Using her grandmother's mystical culinary traditions Claire has built a successful catering business and a carefully controlled utterly predictable life upon the family's peculiar gift for making life-altering delicacies: lilac jelly to engender humility for instance or rose geranium wine to call up fond memories. Garden Spells reveals what happens when Sydney returns to Bascom with her young daughter turning Claire's routine existence upside down. With Sydney's homecoming the magic that the quiet caterer has measured into recipes to shape the thoughts and moods of others begins to influence Claire's own emotions in terrifying and delightful ways. As the sisters reconnect and learn to support one another each finds romance where she least expects it while Sydney's child Bay discovers both the safe home she has longed for and her own surprising gifts. With the help of their elderly cousin Evanelle endowed with her own uncanny skills the Waverley women redeem the past embrace the present and take a joyful leap into the future.,August Book Club: Garden Spells by Sarah Addison Allen16942182,222510459, No venue,,,,,,socializing,Fitness; Wine; Dining Out; New In Town; Nightlife; Women\'s Social; Cocktails; Fun Times; Dancing; Exploring New Restaurants; Books and Drinks; Pets; ,It is recommended to purchase tickets 4-6 weeks in advance.

Thanks again to Dameon for bringing this to our attention! The John Hermann Jr. Memorial Art Museum is currently featuring an exhibit of paintings by Mary Ethel McAuley. McAuley was a young woman living in Berlin during the First World War. She was a correspondent for a Pittsburgh newspaper and painted her observations of life in war-torn Berlin. The museum exhibit highlights these paintings. Visit the museum\'s website here Read this article from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for more about the paintings and McAuley\'s life A free download of Germany in War Time is available from Project Gutenberg. Click here to download it. (N.B. I haven\'t tried the download myself yet.) We will have a guided tour of the exhibit and the regular collection which should take no more than an hour. Our guide will be Paul Cusick museum board member (and also mayor of Bellevue). Admission is free. Then we\'ll head to a local restaurant for late lunch/early dinner. More details to follow. Just wanted to get this announcement up. Go ahead and RSVP! Jeannine aka pghwelshgirl ===================================================== OCTOBER 19 UPDATE Sorry to not add this info sooner but my laptop was out of commission for several days. For our post-museum meal we\'ll head up the street to Joe\'s Rusty Nail at 560 Lincoln Avenue. Here\'s their menu. IMPORTANT!! The voice mail at the Rusty Nail says that they do not take credit or debit cards. Payment is by cash or check only. They do have an ATM but it is probably the kind that charges a fee. Best plan: just bring cash. The good news is the menu prices look reasonable and Paul Cusick tells me the portions are generous. I will be at the museum about 1:15 pm so that we can start our tour at 1:30 pm. ,Germany in War Time - What an American Girl Saw and Heard18288294,223814159,23953556,Harris Theater,Pittsburgh, 809 Liberty Ave,-79.998611,40.442883,literature-writing,Poetry; Watching Movies; Book Club; Museum; History; Intellectual Discussion; Reading; Novel Reading; International Travel; Historic Buildings; Historic Locations and People; local history; World War I; English & British culture/history/literature; ,Good news! I\'ve still been checking upcoming films at local theaters. As I\'d hoped Pittsburgh Filmmakers has scheduled Testament of Youth for the first week in August. Timing isn\'t ideal as it\'s only a week after our visit to Soldiers &amp; Sailors. But c\'est la guerre! Also these schedules are always subject to change. I don\'t think Filmmakers will pull it but they could possibly reschedule for later in August if an earlier film is held over. If that happens I\'ll update the details here ASAP. I\'ve scheduled this for Saturday August 1. Showtimes have not been announced yet so the 8:00 pm time is tentative. According to the Filmmakers website admission to the Harris is $8.00. Here\'s the link to Pittsburgh Filmmakers description of the film. And here (again!) is the film\'s website which includes the trailer. Although there are events at Heinz Hall Benedum and Theater Square that evening the Pirates are out of town. Parking shouldn\'t be too challenging.Here\'s a map of downtown garages For now I\'m scheduling this for the film only. I may add on an optional drink-before nearby once the showtime is known. Thanks! Jeannine ===================================================== JULY 30 UPDATE Basically same info as in comment below: I looked for a bar/restaurant near the Harris but didn\'t see one on the maps that looked close enough. So for those who\'d like to meet to socialize a bit before the film I\'ll be at Crazy Mocha\'s just a few doors away from the Harris Theater starting at 6 pm: 801 Liberty AvenuePittsburgh PA If you\'re interested drop in when you can. I\'ll have Meetup signs up at our tables. We\'ll walk over to the Harris at 7 pm. If you\'re just going to the film please meet us in the lobby by 7:10 pm. For all info re: the film the Harris and parking see the links above. Not too late to RSVP - or bring a friend!. I am following up this announcement with an email. My cell phone for calls/messages/texts is[masked]-6848. See every one Saturday! Jeannine,"FINALLY!

I was just reading about this book and thinking it would be interesting to our group when Dameon posted in the Discussion Forums about this event: La Roche College archivist Elizabeth Williams-Herrman is doing a lecture on Pittsburgh\'s role in WW1 for the Squirrel Hill Historical Society. Her book is called Pittsburgh in WW1: Arsenal of the Allies. According to their website meetings of the Squirrel Hill Historical Society are FREE. They meet at the Church of the Redeemer on Forbes Avenue near the Squirrel Hill business district. We\'ll meet there at 7:15 pm to get assembled and seated for the 7:30 pm lecture. I will confirm all of this and provide more details in the next few days. In the meantime go ahead and RSVP. Click the link for the calendar of the Squirrel Hill Historical Society. Scroll down the page to find this event. You can find the book on amazon.com There is also a partial-text Google Books version if you\'d like a preview. Jeannine ================================================= AUGUST 31 UPDATE Just confirming/clarifying the information in the original announcement. Sorry it took me longer than anticipated. The Squirrel Hill Historical Society confirms that the event is free. They do not ask for donations but do have a voluntary donation box on the desk. We do not need to RSVP to them as well - your Meetup RSVP is all you need. They tell me that they usually have 50 to 70 people. To prevent getting lost in the crowd do try to arrive by 7:15 pm. Parking in the church lot is quite limited. There may be parking available in the adjacent St. Edmund\'s lot. Best bet is to park on adjacent streets - Forbes Avenue or Darlington Road or up the street on Murray Avenue. If you\'re parking in a kiosk zone I believe parking is free after 6 pm. The back door of the church is their entrance. This is the entrance closer to Darlington Road. They will have signs posted. The meeting room is the main one on the first floor. Their speakers usually present for 1 to 1-1/2 hours. They allow Q&amp;A afterwards. Also they let people mill around and talk as long as they want as there is no time limit to the room. Elizabeth Williams-Herrman has also responded to me and says she will have her book for sale that night. The price is $20. If people are up for it we meet afterwards at the Squirrel Hill Cafe just up the street on Forbes Avenue. As always I will send a reminder email which will include my cell phone number and any last-minute details.,Lecture - Sq Hill Historical Society - Pittsburgh in WW1: Arsenal of the Allies18289411,rzgmklytmbbc,24072727,Stewart Avenue Lutheran Church,Pittsburgh, 2810 Brownsville Road,-79.977417,40.383015,religion-beliefs,Bible Study; Christian Ministry; Christian Social; Spirituality; Prayer; Christian; God; Jesus Christ; Knowing God More Intimately; Church; Bible; Bible Study and Fellowship; Prayer & Bible Studies; ,"We meet at Stewart Avenue Lutheran Church every Sunday at 5:00pm.

Vista motel has been slowly deteriorating on an isolated roadside and its proprietor John Henley is not faring much better. Since his wife left him and their nine year-old son Ted John has drifted into despondency leaving Ted to fend for himself. With no parental or adult supervision to guide him the young Ted s darker impulses begin to emerge leading him to explore a growing fascination with death. This fascination blossoms into a bizarre and dangerous method for roping in the occasional passing motorists for an unplanned overnight stop at the motel. When a mysterious drifter is forced to take up residency at the Mt. Vista for several days he and Ted forge a unique friendship that sends the boy down a dangerous path. The Boy comes from the SpectreVision producing team of Daniel Noah Josh C. Waller and Elijah Wood.

The Pub &amp; Pizza has a great meeting room upstairs packed with tables. We will have table service and the full food &amp; beer menu. Support our hosts by buying food &amp; beer! Nuff said. Now then to the business at hand. Instead of a tournament like we did at Steve\'s house I\'d like to try a new format called the ""Blitz"" format. See description here. Groups of 4 fill up as people arrive and they start playing as soon as there are 4. It should work well for us since there is no set starting time and if we play short matches (3 or 5 points) we can mix skill levels. Blitz DetailsAll matches will be 5 points. $10 entry unlimited re-entries if you lose. We\'ll just keep filling brackets as long as we have time to finish them and still play the finals. The winner of the mini-bracket of 4 gets their $10 back and is automatically entered to play the next round against the winner(s) of the other brackets. That format is TBD depending on even/odd/how many players/etc 90% of all entries will go into the prize pool which will pay 2 places for sure and maybe more if a lot of brackets get played. The 10% as always pays for meetup costs and anything left over goes into the kitty for future expenses. My friend and backgammon board seller Bill Hathaway will be running the event tonight with me as backup. Treat him with the same awe and reverence you heap upon me and we\'ll all be just fine. Of course as always you don\'t have to participate in the Blitzes. You can just come bring your board and play. Chouettes are always an option. So is sitting around eating pizza. Hey! Be a rebel.

We have two large tables reserved for us which will accommodate 6 large boards. If we get more than 12 players we will have to move some games outside. Come at 6:30 for a beverage and one of their awesome wood-fired pizzas. Then we\'ll start a tournament at 7. They are open until 10 so we should have plenty of time. We\'ll run a tournament even if only 4 people show up. Which is only 3 other than me so come on. Round robin or otherwise we will do this! Everyone: You don\'t have to enter the tournament at all you can just come and play backgammon with whoever wants to. Beginners: If we have enough beginners we will try to do a separate event for you but if not come anyway and play games with anyone you can find or go ahead and try your luck in the tournament. I will have a prize for the beginner-level player who makes it the farthest in the tournament. Tournament Details We will run a ""Single-Elimination Two-Match-Minimum Two Winners"" tournament as explained here. You are guaranteed two matches. From your second match on when you lose you\'re out. Registration begins at 6:30 tournament begins at 7. They close at 10. The tournament will be capped at 16 players. 5-point matches. The entry fee will be $10 with a $10 optional side pool. The pace will be brisk but not rushed. If we get 16 entries you will play a maximum of 4 matches in 3 hours. I think that\'s realistic. Entry fees will pay 90% return with two winners - 54% goes to the winner of the zero-loss side 36% to the winner of the one-loss size 10% goes to the club. (to defray meetup costs) Side pools will pay 100% return with 60% going to the farthest-advancing on the zero-loss side and 40% to the farthest-advancing on the one-loss side.

No tournament this month but if anyone wants to play in a chouette we will organize that trying to match up similar skill levels.

The 10% goes to the club as always. There will be 3 tiers so people can play at whatever level they are comfortable with: $5 entry winner gets $18 $10 entry winner gets $36 $20 entry winner gets $72 The brackets will fill up as I get entry fees and as soon as we get 4 players in a level I\'ll randomize those 4 and you can start playing.

On the very first move of the game you can often give yourself an advantage if you know the recommended opening moves.

Four of these were cases where medical tests showed clear or partial evidence of Lyme disease. One did not show up on any of the tests and may have been something else.""

(see more info below!) Recommended items to bring along:~camera~notebook (I enjoy stopping and slowing down for folks to take notes if they like)~water~small snack And don\'t forget to wear long sleeves/pants to help keep any ticks away! Walks are usually a sliding scale donation-based experience ($5-10) as I lead highly educational walks and offer you the hands-on experience that no books can truly offer! As usual though I just want people to get out and learn plants so if it\'s not in your budget please do not worry about it. Just bring your excitement and respect for plants and nature! :-) Kids and teens always free! Get the youth outdoors! And now for the new moon astrology! From about.com ""If you\'ve been stretched too thin by things that aren\'t satisfying Virgo gets you back on the righteous track. That\'s the path that unfolds from your natural gifts and sense of service and calling. The mutable (changeable) impulse of Virgo makes this a New Moon to shift your shape or attitude. Virgo is alert to the confounding buffet of choice and has an instinct for choosing that which supports your dreams in practical ways. It\'s an ideal New Moon to earth your dreams with plans that unfold along a realistic path. Or to invite that kind of guidance along with dream messages signs and allies to point the way.""

This park is too vast and thriving to just visit one part of it! Let\'s hike through the park and we\'ll find Black Walnuts Hawthorn trees Autumn Olive Teasel (hopefully!) Burdock Elderberry Chickweed Coltsfoot Pokeweed Yarrow and much much more! Come head outside and enjoy a tour of this incredible park not only to see the sights and sounds but to get a first-hand experience of the wild plants growing here that we can use for food and medicine in the wild. If you\'ve been through the park before this is a chance to see it with a new pair of eyes. If you have never been to the park before...... brace yourself for the greatness! We will be moving at a fairly slow pace for a total of around 3 miles. There are many places that would make excellent snack spots and stopping points to take in the view. This will still be more of a plant ID hike than a timed or hurried through-hike so do remember to bring water and a snack! We will be finding tons of plants! Bring along a camera too! We may even be able to explore Wingfield Pines area across the street if everyone feels up for it! I would classify this as potentially challenging for some or easy as cake for others. There will be a steep hill or two to ascend and descend and we should plan to be out until the early afternoon. My intent for this meetup is to not only identify a multitude of plants in various environments but to show those who come along just how big this beautiful park is and what an asset it is to the community. Kids 15 and under always free but this is probably not an ideal walk for younger or impatient kids! Plan to hike even if it sprinkles but a major storm will be cause for cancellation/rescheduling. I\'m asking a donation of $10 but as always if this is too much and you are interested please just bring what you can even if it is only yourself! Green Blessings! Here is an image of the pavilion for those unfamiliar with the park. And as always I will send out an email 1-3 days in advance with my phone number and other details/info if any.

We've been reading The Lymond Chronicles together and following Francis Crawford of Lymond to Scotland France Malta Constantinople Moscow (and back again). We're wrapping up this group-read with a no-spoilers-barred review of the entire series! If you haven't wanted to be part of a book-by-book reread but are yearning to talk about this series now's your chance to discuss the characters you love (and love to hate) and agonize over those confounding plot twists. After this meeting we'll take a little break until 2016 when we'll gather again to begin reading The House of Niccolo together. Watch this space for details about that. Parking is available on-street or in the covered metered lot directly beneath the library entrance on Forbes Avenue.

We've decided to spend a little more time on this rich novel and will be continuing our discussion of the divinely Disorderly Knights at our next meeting. It's been wonderful to see so many new 'members' of this group join us online and we hope to see more of you in person at our meeting. If you have any questions about the group or our discussions please feel free to email me coordinator Sue Morris via [masked]. Hope to see you on August 16th at the Squirrel Hill Carnegie Library.

We will be at the shelter at the end of the street by the parking circle. Getting around Rochester in general and getting to Riverfront Park in particular can be very confusing. DIRECTIONS: The simplest approach is beginning from the PA 18 exit (Exit 12) on PA 60 proceed north on PA 18 for 3.1 miles to the Rochester Bridge. Immediately after crossing the bridge turn right at the traffic light onto Pleasant Street. At the bottom of the hill in 0.2 miles you come to a complicated six-way intersection. Turn onto first right New York Avenue (which is at a 90-degree angle from the road you are on there is a white sign here that says ""Rochester Riverfront Park"" as well as a few other things) and proceed over bridge that bends to the right. After 0.25 mile turn left at the stop sign onto Harrison Street. The Ohio River and Riverfront Park are ahead at the next stop sign (0.1 mile). Turn right on Water Street; the road runs along the Ohio briefly then turns north and parallels the Beaver River for about 0.7 mile before terminating in a parking circle. We don\'t plan on anything fancy. Vicky Kennedy and I will provide hamburgers and hot dogs with buns. Veggie burgers will also be available. Volunteers to bring other picnic foods would be very appreciated. Vicky will be coordinating the food and drink. If you would be willing to contribute food or a monetary donation please contact Vicky Kennedy [masked] or call[masked] For this meeting I need to limit it to members.

It's a new season and with it a new set of interesting technology topics at the Arista Philly Meetup Group. For the October 22nd Meetup we will discuss a network-wide approach for workload orchestration and workflow automation delivering a turnkey solution for cloud networking. And we will also discuss the the newly announced capability for Macro-Segmentation Services (MSS ) that allows next-generation firewalls and Application Delivery Controllers to be enabled automatically for specific workloads and workflows across any network topology. This includes Layer-2 Layer-3 and overlay network virtualization frameworks. MSS addresses a growing gap in current security deployment models wherein embedded security in the virtualization hypervisors addresses inter-VM communication and physical firewalls address north-south traffic. Yet no solution exists to dynamically insert security services for data centers consisting of a mixture of physical and virtualized workloads. Arista is working with leaders in the industry such as Check Point F5 Networks Fortinet Palo Alto Networks and VMware to advance and simplify the integration of physical and virtualized resources with its cloud networking technologies.

It never occurs to most people that they have many resources available to guide them. It is your choice whether you want to move through life aware or unaware; guided or unguided. Either way you will travel across the terrain called your life. When you go unguided it s scary and your are spending most of your time protecting yourself instead of enjoying the scenery but when you go with guidance and ask your higher self to step into your life and point out to you all of the opportunities and help you notice what s beautiful and recognize where the hidden secrets are then the journey takes on an entirely different tone and quality. In our next meet up will explore some wonderful tools and techniques such as inspirational writing automatic writing and psychometry that will help us to have better communication and guidance from our higher self and further enhance our awareness that the Universe is available to all us.

We will do a fun exploration where we will do a reading on our self so that we can learn to easily and instantly tap into the energy of our spirit to receive the guidance we need to solve any challenge we are facing. This dialogue with our spirit and will help us to become conscious that we all have access to real answers real guidance that is reliable and available to us whenever we ask for it. We will also have a have a short guided meditation to help us relax and get into flow. I hope you will join us for a fun and enlightening meet up.

We ll discuss ways in which we can spiral out of the negative energy that causes us so much pain. We ll have another fun and enlightening exercise to help us learn how to witness others and hold space so that we be able to change the vibration with anyone we are listening to whether it s a client friend spouse family member or a co-worker. This exercise will teach us how to bring the other person s frequency up to match our own. We will also discuss the two main blocks to spiritual guidance and how to overcome them. Once you do you ll be able to hold space and trust yourself and know without question that all seeds will sprout in due time when we learn to give space.

In fact the happier and more balanced you are the more profoundly contributing you will be to this planet and everything living on it. On a spirit level if every one of us decides to take better care of ourselves if we decide to bring ourselves into balance we can create a much improved future for ourselves our children and our planet. But balance is sometimes easier to talk about and long for than it is to attain. In our misguided efforts to achieve this desired balanced state we often feel the solution is to become more active to simply do more to make more commitments in our already over-committed lives. This is the right approach; it sets us up for certain failure. Action for action s sake often leads to a life of increased imbalance. We will discuss ways to prevent this from happening in our lives. We re going to do a fun exercise where we will read our first three chakras and we ll finish up with a relaxing meditation. Look forward to seeing at our next meet up.,Six Sensory Living18619642,224358273,23875882,Panera Bread,Pittsburgh, 1500 Washington Rd,-80.050438,40.356956,health-wellbeing,Metaphysics; Meditation; Psychics; Self-Improvement; Law of Attraction; Life Transformation; Spirituality; Wellness; Fun Times; Energy Healing; Healthy Living; Self Exploration; Self-Empowerment; ,In our next meet we are going to have another fun and interactive discussion opening our awareness to how our heart is the divine and sacred gift where as the rational mind is the faithful servant. Sadly most of have thrown away this gift and our lives have become enslaved by the servant. The good news is we can train the servant so that the heart and the mind work in Unison. This is called The Sacred Marriage We will do a very fun exercise allowing the intellect to serve your heart. When you allow your heart to inform and lead the rest of your body. When you tap into the energy of the heart space it connects you to source the sea of love. You are in love not out of love. You are connected to source which is the enlightened frequency. We will also explore what is called the Divine Triangle which where all spirit energy flows in the body. Look forward to seeing on Tuesday the 11th.

We are constantly reading other people situations and events that happen in our life but what part of us is really doing the reading? Is it our ego our soul or is it our higher self. When we read another person what message do we convey to them? What is their take away experience? When we read another person or event we tend to use one particular strategy or sense which limits our ability to read accurately. We will explore ways in which we can learn to use all of our senses in our daily life. Once we notice and identify how we are reading we can use our intuition to move beyond and explore other things allowing us to help ourselves and others at much deeper level. Whether you are an experienced reader or just beginning you will find this meet up to be fun and enlightening. Hope to see you there!

We will explore some powerful anchors that help us know without a doubt if we are getting true intuition or if it is just mind chatter. We will have a fun and engaging exercise that will help us in our transformation making it easier for us to surrender to our own great inner light our own greatness and our own brilliance. This meet up will help us pull things together so that we can easily change the channel and make the shift into the sixth sensory paradigm.

In our Meet ups we will be practicing Meditation on Twin Hearts. This is a ~20 mins long guided meditation with the ultimate goal of achieving oneness with our Higher Self. It is based on the fact that certain energy centers in our system are entry points to certain levels of Divine Energy. This meditation focuses on strengthening our divine connection through our Heart and Crown centers as they are the centers of love ... love for man and love for the divine. As we practice regularly we learn to love the Divine more through the love for mankind. The secret is in the Heart :) An interesting feature of this meditation is that as we expand our love centers we also become instruments of world service when we bless the Earth with Light Love and Power. With regular practice we experience a holistic transformation as our energy system becomes more subtler and stronger. Though the meditation is only about 20 mins we give ourselves more time to meet and interact and learn from each others experiences. So please give yourselves about 2 hours for the event. Also you are welcome to donate to help cover cost of the event space! Looking forward to meeting you all !

Product Description#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER When we deny our stories they define us.When we own our stories we get to write the ending. Social scientist Bren Brown has ignited a global conversation on courage vulnerability shame and worthiness. Her pioneering work uncovered a profound truth: Vulnerability the willingness to show up and be seen with no guarantee of outcome is the only path to more love belonging creativity and joy. But living a brave life is not always easy: We are inevitably going to stumble and fall. It is the rise from falling that Brown takes as her subject in Rising Strong. As a grounded theory researcher Brown has listened as a range of people from leaders in Fortune 500 companies and the military to artists couples in long-term relationships teachers and parents shared their stories of being brave falling and getting back up. She asked herself What do these people with strong and loving relationships leaders nurturing creativity artists pushing innovation and clergy walking with people through faith and mystery have in common? The answer was clear: They recognize the power of emotion and they re not afraid to lean in to discomfort. Walking into our stories of hurt can feel dangerous. But the process of regaining our footing in the midst of struggle is where our courage is tested and our values are forged. Our stories of struggle can be big ones like the loss of a job or the end of a relationship or smaller ones like a conflict with a friend or colleague. Regardless of magnitude or circumstance the rising strong process is the same: We reckon with our emotions and get curious about what we re feeling; we rumble with our stories until we get to a place of truth; and we live this process every day until it becomes a practice and creates nothing short of a revolution in our lives. Rising strong after a fall is how we cultivate wholeheartedness. It s the process Brown writes that teaches us the most about who we are.Product Description#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER When we deny our stories they define us.When we own our stories we get to write the ending. Social scientist Bren Brown has ignited a global conversation on courage vulnerability shame and worthiness. Her pioneering work uncovered a profound truth: Vulnerability the willingness to show up and be seen with no guarantee of outcome is the only path to more love belonging creativity and joy. But living a brave life is not always easy: We are inevitably going to stumble and fall. It is the rise from falling that Brown takes as her subject in Rising Strong. As a grounded theory researcher Brown has listened as a range of people from leaders in Fortune 500 companies and the military to artists couples in long-term relationships teachers and parents shared their stories of being brave falling and getting back up. She asked herself What do these people with strong and loving relationships leaders nurturing creativity artists pushing innovation and clergy walking with people through faith and mystery have in common? The answer was clear: They recognize the power of emotion and they re not afraid to lean in to discomfort. Walking into our stories of hurt can feel dangerous. But the process of regaining our footing in the midst of struggle is where our courage is tested and our values are forged. Our stories of struggle can be big ones like the loss of a job or the end of a relationship or smaller ones like a conflict with a friend or colleague. Regardless of magnitude or circumstance the rising strong process is the same: We reckon with our emotions and get curious about what we re feeling; we rumble with our stories until we get to a place of truth; and we live this process every day until it becomes a practice and creates nothing short of a revolution in our lives. Rising strong after a fall is how we cultivate wholeheartedness. It s the process Brown writes that teaches us the most about who we are.",Rising Strong Bren Brown18664157,224375501,17160552,Panera Bread,Mount Lebanon, 1500 Washington Road,-80.050377,40.35762,literature-writing,Book Club; Reading; Inspirational; Self Help and Inspirational Writers; Women\'s Book Club; Women\'s Self Help; Inspirational Book Club; ,"In this book meet we will discuss the book ""Eight Reasons Your Life Matters"" by John Herrick.

We build hulking fortresses around our code to protect our apps from the real world. However the tools we use the languages and third-party libs often conceal lurking hazards too.

Can we preclude hazards of loose typing and mutable state at compile time? Yes. We'll look at a popular third-party tool Memcached and criticize some hazardous parts of its API.

About unjustified police killings of African Americans about a decent living wage about free college tuition and lower student loan interest rates about institutional racism.

Here is evidence that it does matter now from two newspapers that covered our around 20 Bernie folks who came to the Labor Day Parade. ""As Vice President Joe Biden left a Downtown stage at the Pittsburgh Labor Day Parade he stopped to acknowledge Bernie Sanders supporters in the crowd giving two thumbs up. Biden didn t officially voice his support for Sanders but spoke to parade attendees about the importance of the steel industry and his views on the rising cost of college tuition a topic Sanders is known for supporting. ... ""Robert Beckwith a member of the organization Pittsburghers for Bernie came to the parade hoping to find blue collar support. ""Beckwith stood on the side of the parade carrying a sign saying BERNIE SANDERS his shirt adorned with pins in support of the candidate. [The parade] is an opportunity to reach people who can connect to Bernie because laborers can relate to his love for the workers of America Beckwith said."" Pitt News 9/7/15 ""...As he dashed in gray trousers and a white polo shirt through this Democratic bastion Mr. Biden repeatedly encountered vocal supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders the Vermont independent who has emerged as Hillary Rodham Clinton s most significant challenger in a primary season that was once thought to be little more than a formality for her. Feel the Bern Joe! one Sanders backer bellowed from the sidewalk. ""When he approached the Sanders backers Mr. Biden offered only praise for the senator calling him a friend. ""And in his remarks after the parade the vice president brought up the Vermont senator s name without prompting saying Mr. Sanders was doing a hell of a job. Mr. Biden made no mention of Mrs. Clinton. ... NYTimes 9/7/15 We were also mentioned in reports from the CBS and ABC affiliates and our people were interviewed by reporters for national CBS and NBC. Of course much of the coverage was due to Vice President Biden\'s presence. But in our own way we reach people every time we go out. *    * The Strip District Every Saturday thousands of Pittsburghers head for the Strip District to buy vegetables fruits coffee arts and crafts and go to restaurants.

We have two options for living life in any given moment: Weakness and Strength. Weakness is grounded in Fear. It pushes us to run away hide and avoid. We don\'t want to see the world nor do we want to see ourselves. We don\'t want to look because we don\'t know if we can handle what we find. Strength is grounded in Love. It calls on us to run toward life face it head on and openly recognize truth. Strength wants us to fully engage with ourselves and the world around us. It calls on us to look at ourselves from a place of simultaneous compassion and courage knowing we can handle anything life throws our way. In this session we will consider one of the most fundamental parts of living in Strength - practicing forgiveness. How well do we each practice this in our lives? How well do we practice it with ourselves? Join us for a frank and trust-based conversation among allies for how each of us can approach this issue from a masculine place of Strength.

Society often expects us to feel nothing and if we do feel anything to feel anger and nothing else. All other emotions are off limits. But this isn\'t real. There is no need for a fight-or-flight mentality our emotions. They provide us with vast amount of knowledge about who we are where we truly want to go in our lives and what our core selves are trying to communicate to us.

Rituals can be created and led by more than one woman at a time. It\'s a fun and enriching experience.

I am setting the max RSVP to 4 new players (so 5 RSVP\'s since as organizer I automatically RSVP yes) for now since last night (Sept. 23) we had twelve players for the first part of the evening when a couple of the older players got too tired to continue and with three courts that was almost the perfect size group.

You technically don\'t have to RSVP at all because this meetup group didn\'t organize the event but it would be nice for everyone if there weren\'t suddenly way too many players for the three courts available and there are already several regulars not part of this meetup group. Admission to the gym is 5$. Pay at the front desk. This includes the cost of the ""real"" (e.g. goose-feather) birdies/shuttlecocks. If you prefer faster more durable nylon shuttlecocks personally I\'d happy to play them with you but some of the other players get funny about it (superstitious?).",Let\'s meetup and play (indoor-court) badminton!18877001,qbjrklytnbjb, No venue,,,,,,sports-recreation,Badminton; Sports and Recreation; Sports and Socials; Badminton Social and Singles; Competitive Badminton; Pick Up Badminton; Mixed Doubles Badminton; Badminton League; casual badminton; Doubles Badminton; Sunday Badminton; Badminton after work; ,"Informal pickup court play on a regular gym surface. single matches should please wait until there are insufficient players not too tired to participate to form a doubles match then singles matches are welcome!

It would be great if we build up this group large enough that we can have beginner\'s intermediate expert meetups and tournaments with prizes or raffles etc. Tell all your friends especially pickleball players who don\'t find the game fast enough tennis players who find their game too hard on their joints and muscles or anyone who would like to find a fun aerobic sport with a very small time/training/budget requirement with tons of quick-thinking and strategy and very little chance of being seriously injured! It would be super if you would RSVP to this meetup to reserve your spot! You technically don\'t have to RSVP at all because this meetup group didn\'t organize the event but it would be nice for everyone if there weren\'t suddenly way too many players for the three courts available and there are already several regulars not part of this meetup group. Admission to the gym is 5$. Pay at the front desk. This includes the cost of the ""real"" (e.g. goose-feather) birdies/shuttlecocks. If you prefer faster more durable nylon shuttlecocks personally I\'d happy to play them with you but some of the other players get funny about it (superstitious?).",Let\'s meetup and play (indoor-court) badminton!18877001,qbjrklytpbwb, No venue,,,,,,sports-recreation,Badminton; Sports and Recreation; Sports and Socials; Badminton Social and Singles; Competitive Badminton; Pick Up Badminton; Mixed Doubles Badminton; Badminton League; casual badminton; Doubles Badminton; Sunday Badminton; Badminton after work; ,"Note: The start time is now 8:00 pm instead of 7:00 pm! This change applies for the next few weeks. There is also a library that is open until 8 pm if you forget. The point is don\'t show up at 7:00 because there is not much else to do there while waiting except work out (you may or may not have to pay extra to that I don\'t know) or go to the library. I found out about this schedule change the hard way last week. Given this scheduling change I would really appreciate some suggestions for alternate facilities to beg borrow or rent and some days of the week and times that might work for other people. An ideal facility has badminton court markings nets and support posts to use high ceilings diffuse fairly bright light without any direct sunshine shower facilities and drinking water. Vending machines or nearby places to get a bite to eat would be an added plus for those players who would prefer to arrive straight from work. Hampton\'s facility offers informal play in a clean well-lit facility with a ceiling suitable for executing high clear shots. Separate men\'s and women\'s showers and changing areas are available in the bathrooms. The court surface is made of concrete and the official boundaries of each of six courts are clearly marked. On Tuesdays we are allotted three badminton courts. Hampton Community Center allows us to set up a fourth court if warranted. There needs to be a sufficient number of badminton players and few enough basketball players cheerleaders and martial artists that they have adequate remaining space. Admission is 5$ which must be paid at the front desk. This helps pay for the ""real"" (goose-feather) shuttlecocks. If you prefer to play the significantly more durable and consistent nylon shuttlecocks I for one will be willing to play them with you. But I have to admit the goose-feathered ones do play well. They are largely hand-crafted and tested partly manually believe it or not! Please continue to RSVP to this meeting! I appreciate it that everyone has done this so far! Thank-you! (Certain Hampton regulars (who are not part of this Meetup (yet?) ) will probably get testy if too many of us show up at once even if it turns out the new people end up attending more regularly than they do.)",Let\'s meetup and play (indoor-court) badminton!18877001,qbjrklytnbrb, No venue,,,,,,sports-recreation,Badminton; Sports and Recreation; Sports and Socials; Badminton Social and Singles; Competitive Badminton; Pick Up Badminton; Mixed Doubles Badminton; Badminton League; casual badminton; Doubles Badminton; Sunday Badminton; Badminton after work; ,"Informal pickup court play on a regular gym surface. single matches should please wait until there are insufficient players not too tired to participate to form a doubles match then singles matches are welcome!

World Kindness Day has been recognised in many countries throughout the world for a number of years. Driven by The World Kindness Movement the day involves people around the world showing that we can think about more than ourselves and make the world a better place because of it. Everyone\'s idea of kindness is different. Helping an elderly person cross the road giving someone a compliment volunteering at a local children\'s charity or distributing baked goodies in your workplace - it all counts. Nothing huge or shouting it from the rooftops it\'s a gesture as gentle as the notion itself. Remember what Wordsworth said; ""the best bits of a man\'s life are the simple random acts of kindness and love"".
