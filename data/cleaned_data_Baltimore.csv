|b'4620922, 25, Pathfinder Society and Adventure Card Guild of Baltimore MD, Pathfinder Society the organized play arm of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is thriving Baltimore! Join us at a variety of locations around Baltimore as we continue to Explore Report and Cooperate across the Inner Sea!\nAbout Pathfinder Society Organized Play\nIn an organized play campaign your character exists in a common setting shared by thousands of other gamers from around the world. In each Pathfinder Society game your character experiences adventures in two different ways. The first is a short one-sitting adventure (or "scenario") that is a single episode in a continuing story and generally lasts four to five hours. The second is a longer multi-session adventure (or "module") that is a single adventure but can take anywhere from eight to twelve hours to play.\nYou can take your character to any public Pathfinder Society event anywhere in the world and while the Game Master and your companions might change every time you play your character advances as normal. Over time campaigning in an organized play environment offers a uniquely immersive experience as your diverse companions add depth and character to the campaign world. It\'s also a great way to get in touch with other local gamers meet new people and play regularly without all the prep work and scheduling of a traditional campaign. Your local regional coordinator (also called a Venture-Captain or Venture-Lieutenant) can assist you in finding or setting up your own Pathfinder Society event.\nAlternatively some players prefer to keep their Pathfinder Society experience limited to a familiar group of friends using the Pathfinder Society character creation rules adventure scenarios and reward structure as the framework for a private campaign. Either approach is a valid way to experience the campaign and many players enjoy a combination of public and private adventuring.\nBecause Organized Play takes place in a shared-world environment additional rules are required to ensure that all players at all tables share a similar experience no matter who is running the game. The&nbsp;Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play outlines these special rules ensuring a level playing field for all. Please read over the contents of this guide carefully.\nHow do I get started?\nAll Pathfinder Society players must register themselves and their characters online. When you register on the&nbsp;My Pathfinder Society page you\'ll receive an official Pathfinder Society Number. Keep your Pathfinder Society Number handy and bring it with you to every Pathfinder Society event you attend. Paizo uses this number to record the adventures your character has completed and the prestige she has gained. Each character you create has a unique number appended to your Pathfinder Society Number so if your number is 10222 the second character you create will be 10222\xe2\x80\x932.\nIf you don\'t have time to create a new character or simply wish to try out a new character class you may choose to use one of several&nbsp;level-appropriate pregenerated characters available or from your local event coordinator. If you play a 1st-level pregenerated character you can apply the credit for her first adventure to a newly created character of your very own.\nWhere can I play?\nOnce you\'ve got a Pathfinder Society Number and have created your character you\'re ready to play your first Pathfinder Society scenario or module! The easiest way to find a local game is to join this Meetup and RSVP for one of the upcoming Meetups on this site with an advertised level range for a level 1 character. The level range will be listed at the end of the Meetup title in parenthesis such as (1-2)(1-5) or (1-7).\nWhat do I have to bring?\nAt a minimum you\'ll need a character sheet with all of your character information and details as well as an inventory tracking sheet which you can Download Here. You\'ll also need to bring a copy of your Pathfinder Society Number (it\'s a good idea to write it somewhere on your character sheet) a set of 7 polyhedral dice a pencil a 1-inch scale miniature or token to represent your character on a combat grid and a copy of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook. Other players may be able to lend you dice or a miniature for the gaming session if you don\'t have any but eventually you\'ll want to get a set of your own. The only thing left needed is a desire to roleplay and have have fun!\nI hope to see you at the gaming table soon\nVenture Captain Matt Hudson  Baltimore MD Lodge,Baltimore, games, -76.6100006104, 39.2999992371, Sci-Fi/Fantasy; Dungeons & Dragons; D20 Gaming; Roleplaying Games (RPGs); Tabletop Role Playing and Board Games; Gaming; Dungeons & Dragons 3.5; Baltimore; Pathfinder Roleplaying Game; Pathfinder Society; Pathfinder Society by Paizo; ,4620922, lqzqclytlbnb, PACG: Adventure 0-2 A Pirate\'s Life, 2015-08-10 22:30:00, The store copy of the game will be focusing on continuing Adventure 2.

If you can bring a core game please list that with your RSVP so we can expand the number of player seats. Adventure 0-2 - A Pirate\'s Life Yo ho! A pirate\xe2\x80\x99s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\xe2\x80\x99s more to a pirate\xe2\x80\x99s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\xe2\x80\x99s fair and foul and in the Shackles the Pirate\xe2\x80\x99s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\xe2\x80\x99s orders every captain has to answer to the council.

|b'4620922, 25, Pathfinder Society and Adventure Card Guild of Baltimore MD, Pathfinder Society the organized play arm of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is thriving Baltimore! Join us at a variety of locations around Baltimore as we continue to Explore Report and Cooperate across the Inner Sea!\nAbout Pathfinder Society Organized Play\nIn an organized play campaign your character exists in a common setting shared by thousands of other gamers from around the world. In each Pathfinder Society game your character experiences adventures in two different ways. The first is a short one-sitting adventure (or "scenario") that is a single episode in a continuing story and generally lasts four to five hours. The second is a longer multi-session adventure (or "module") that is a single adventure but can take anywhere from eight to twelve hours to play.\nYou can take your character to any public Pathfinder Society event anywhere in the world and while the Game Master and your companions might change every time you play your character advances as normal. Over time campaigning in an organized play environment offers a uniquely immersive experience as your diverse companions add depth and character to the campaign world. It\'s also a great way to get in touch with other local gamers meet new people and play regularly without all the prep work and scheduling of a traditional campaign. Your local regional coordinator (also called a Venture-Captain or Venture-Lieutenant) can assist you in finding or setting up your own Pathfinder Society event.\nAlternatively some players prefer to keep their Pathfinder Society experience limited to a familiar group of friends using the Pathfinder Society character creation rules adventure scenarios and reward structure as the framework for a private campaign. Either approach is a valid way to experience the campaign and many players enjoy a combination of public and private adventuring.\nBecause Organized Play takes place in a shared-world environment additional rules are required to ensure that all players at all tables share a similar experience no matter who is running the game. The&nbsp;Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play outlines these special rules ensuring a level playing field for all. Please read over the contents of this guide carefully.\nHow do I get started?\nAll Pathfinder Society players must register themselves and their characters online. When you register on the&nbsp;My Pathfinder Society page you\'ll receive an official Pathfinder Society Number. Keep your Pathfinder Society Number handy and bring it with you to every Pathfinder Society event you attend. Paizo uses this number to record the adventures your character has completed and the prestige she has gained. Each character you create has a unique number appended to your Pathfinder Society Number so if your number is 10222 the second character you create will be 10222\xe2\x80\x932.\nIf you don\'t have time to create a new character or simply wish to try out a new character class you may choose to use one of several&nbsp;level-appropriate pregenerated characters available or from your local event coordinator. If you play a 1st-level pregenerated character you can apply the credit for her first adventure to a newly created character of your very own.\nWhere can I play?\nOnce you\'ve got a Pathfinder Society Number and have created your character you\'re ready to play your first Pathfinder Society scenario or module! The easiest way to find a local game is to join this Meetup and RSVP for one of the upcoming Meetups on this site with an advertised level range for a level 1 character. The level range will be listed at the end of the Meetup title in parenthesis such as (1-2)(1-5) or (1-7).\nWhat do I have to bring?\nAt a minimum you\'ll need a character sheet with all of your character information and details as well as an inventory tracking sheet which you can Download Here. You\'ll also need to bring a copy of your Pathfinder Society Number (it\'s a good idea to write it somewhere on your character sheet) a set of 7 polyhedral dice a pencil a 1-inch scale miniature or token to represent your character on a combat grid and a copy of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook.

In each Pathfinder Society game your character experiences adventures in two different ways. The first is a short one-sitting adventure (or "scenario") that is a single episode in a continuing story and generally lasts four to five hours.

It\'s also a great way to get in touch with other local gamers meet new people and play regularly without all the prep work and scheduling of a traditional campaign.

The Scenarios for Adventure 1 and Adventure 3 are also available at the store and can be run by anyone with a copy of the core card game and the relevant Adventure Deck numbers. If you can bring a core game please list that with your RSVP so we can expand the number of player seats. Adventure 0-2 - A Pirate\'s Life Yo ho! A pirate\xe2\x80\x99s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\xe2\x80\x99s more to a pirate\xe2\x80\x99s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\xe2\x80\x99s fair and foul and in the Shackles the Pirate\xe2\x80\x99s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\xe2\x80\x99s orders every captain has to answer to the council. Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you but that\xe2\x80\x99s not an easy feat. For a start wherever there\xe2\x80\x99s power there\xe2\x80\x99s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\xe2\x80\x99ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally you\xe2\x80\x99ll attract a host of powerful enemies. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t earn the patronage of a pirate lord the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\xe2\x80\x99t ask questions. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got cargo to deliver rivals to punish ports to defend and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\xc2\xa0 According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\xe2\x80\x99t buy happiness but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\xe2\x80\x99s chum in the water you\xe2\x80\x99ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\xe2\x80\x99re eager to earn her patronage then you\xe2\x80\x99d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders. A few notes about ACG OP: 1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we are sure we have space for but if there is more interest we can almost certainly make more room. So please sign up for the wait list if you want to play. 3.

Keep your Pathfinder Society Number handy and bring it with you to every Pathfinder Society event you attend. Paizo uses this number to record the adventures your character has completed and the prestige she has gained. Each character you create has a unique number appended to your Pathfinder Society Number so if your number is 10222 the second character you create will be 10222\xe2\x80\x932.\nIf you don\'t have time to create a new character or simply wish to try out a new character class you may choose to use one of several&nbsp;level-appropriate pregenerated characters available or from your local event coordinator.

Join us at a variety of locations around Baltimore as we continue to Explore Report and Cooperate across the Inner Sea!\nAbout Pathfinder Society Organized Play\nIn an organized play campaign your character exists in a common setting shared by thousands of other gamers from around the world. In each Pathfinder Society game your character experiences adventures in two different ways. The first is a short one-sitting adventure (or "scenario") that is a single episode in a continuing story and generally lasts four to five hours. The second is a longer multi-session adventure (or "module") that is a single adventure but can take anywhere from eight to twelve hours to play.\nYou can take your character to any public Pathfinder Society event anywhere in the world and while the Game Master and your companions might change every time you play your character advances as normal. Over time campaigning in an organized play environment offers a uniquely immersive experience as your diverse companions add depth and character to the campaign world. It\'s also a great way to get in touch with other local gamers meet new people and play regularly without all the prep work and scheduling of a traditional campaign. Your local regional coordinator (also called a Venture-Captain or Venture-Lieutenant) can assist you in finding or setting up your own Pathfinder Society event.\nAlternatively some players prefer to keep their Pathfinder Society experience limited to a familiar group of friends using the Pathfinder Society character creation rules adventure scenarios and reward structure as the framework for a private campaign. Either approach is a valid way to experience the campaign and many players enjoy a combination of public and private adventuring.\nBecause Organized Play takes place in a shared-world environment additional rules are required to ensure that all players at all tables share a similar experience no matter who is running the game.

The Scenarios for Adventure 1 and Adventure 3 are also available at the store and can be run by anyone with a copy of the core card game and the relevant Adventure Deck numbers. If you can bring a core game please list that with your RSVP so we can expand the number of player seats. Adventure 0-2 - A Pirate\'s Life Yo ho! A pirate\xe2\x80\x99s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\xe2\x80\x99s more to a pirate\xe2\x80\x99s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\xe2\x80\x99s fair and foul and in the Shackles the Pirate\xe2\x80\x99s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\xe2\x80\x99s orders every captain has to answer to the council. Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you but that\xe2\x80\x99s not an easy feat. For a start wherever there\xe2\x80\x99s power there\xe2\x80\x99s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\xe2\x80\x99ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally you\xe2\x80\x99ll attract a host of powerful enemies. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t earn the patronage of a pirate lord the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\xe2\x80\x99t ask questions. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got cargo to deliver rivals to punish ports to defend and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\xc2\xa0 According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\xe2\x80\x99t buy happiness but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\xe2\x80\x99s chum in the water you\xe2\x80\x99ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\xe2\x80\x99re eager to earn her patronage then you\xe2\x80\x99d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders. A few notes about ACG OP: 1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2.

The second is a longer multi-session adventure (or "module") that is a single adventure but can take anywhere from eight to twelve hours to play.\nYou can take your character to any public Pathfinder Society event anywhere in the world and while the Game Master and your companions might change every time you play your character advances as normal. Over time campaigning in an organized play environment offers a uniquely immersive experience as your diverse companions add depth and character to the campaign world. It\'s also a great way to get in touch with other local gamers meet new people and play regularly without all the prep work and scheduling of a traditional campaign. Your local regional coordinator (also called a Venture-Captain or Venture-Lieutenant) can assist you in finding or setting up your own Pathfinder Society event.\nAlternatively some players prefer to keep their Pathfinder Society experience limited to a familiar group of friends using the Pathfinder Society character creation rules adventure scenarios and reward structure as the framework for a private campaign. Either approach is a valid way to experience the campaign and many players enjoy a combination of public and private adventuring.\nBecause Organized Play takes place in a shared-world environment additional rules are required to ensure that all players at all tables share a similar experience no matter who is running the game. The&nbsp;Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play outlines these special rules ensuring a level playing field for all. Please read over the contents of this guide carefully.\nHow do I get started?\nAll Pathfinder Society players must register themselves and their characters online. When you register on the&nbsp;My Pathfinder Society page you\'ll receive an official Pathfinder Society Number. Keep your Pathfinder Society Number handy and bring it with you to every Pathfinder Society event you attend. Paizo uses this number to record the adventures your character has completed and the prestige she has gained. Each character you create has a unique number appended to your Pathfinder Society Number so if your number is 10222 the second character you create will be 10222\xe2\x80\x932.\nIf you don\'t have time to create a new character or simply wish to try out a new character class you may choose to use one of several&nbsp;level-appropriate pregenerated characters available or from your local event coordinator. If you play a 1st-level pregenerated character you can apply the credit for her first adventure to a newly created character of your very own.\nWhere can I play?\nOnce you\'ve got a Pathfinder Society Number and have created your character you\'re ready to play your first Pathfinder Society scenario or module! The easiest way to find a local game is to join this Meetup and RSVP for one of the upcoming Meetups on this site with an advertised level range for a level 1 character. The level range will be listed at the end of the Meetup title in parenthesis such as (1-2)(1-5) or (1-7).\nWhat do I have to bring?\nAt a minimum you\'ll need a character sheet with all of your character information and details as well as an inventory tracking sheet which you can Download Here. You\'ll also need to bring a copy of your Pathfinder Society Number (it\'s a good idea to write it somewhere on your character sheet) a set of 7 polyhedral dice a pencil a 1-inch scale miniature or token to represent your character on a combat grid and a copy of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook. Other players may be able to lend you dice or a miniature for the gaming session if you don\'t have any but eventually you\'ll want to get a set of your own.

Pathfinder Lugizar Trantos recently returned from the Mwangi Expanse with haunted eyes and a pack full of strange idols. Absalom\'s famed Blakros Museum purchased his pieces and Lugizar vanished. The strange monkey idols he pulled from the misty jungles of Mwangi carry with them a fell curse and now their power has laid claim to the museum. Can the Pathfinder Society uncover the source of the curse in time or will the Blackros Museum be forever lost to the mists of Mwangi?

The level range will be listed at the end of the Meetup title in parenthesis such as (1-2)(1-5) or (1-7).\nWhat do I have to bring?\nAt a minimum you\'ll need a character sheet with all of your character information and details as well as an inventory tracking sheet which you can Download Here. You\'ll also need to bring a copy of your Pathfinder Society Number (it\'s a good idea to write it somewhere on your character sheet) a set of 7 polyhedral dice a pencil a 1-inch scale miniature or token to represent your character on a combat grid and a copy of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook. Other players may be able to lend you dice or a miniature for the gaming session if you don\'t have any but eventually you\'ll want to get a set of your own. The only thing left needed is a desire to roleplay and have have fun!\nI hope to see you at the gaming table soon\nVenture Captain Matt Hudson  Baltimore MD Lodge,Baltimore, games, -76.6100006104, 39.2999992371, Sci-Fi/Fantasy; Dungeons & Dragons; D20 Gaming; Roleplaying Games (RPGs); Tabletop Role Playing and Board Games; Gaming; Dungeons & Dragons 3.5; Baltimore; Pathfinder Roleplaying Game; Pathfinder Society; Pathfinder Society by Paizo; ,4620922, lqzqclytlbfb, PACG: Adventure 0-2 A Pirate\'s Life, 2015-08-03 22:30:00, The store copy of the game will be focusing on continuing Adventure 2. The Scenarios for Adventure 1 and Adventure 3 are also available at the store and can be run by anyone with a copy of the core card game and the relevant Adventure Deck numbers. If you can bring a core game please list that with your RSVP so we can expand the number of player seats. Adventure 0-2 - A Pirate\'s Life Yo ho! A pirate\xe2\x80\x99s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\xe2\x80\x99s more to a pirate\xe2\x80\x99s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\xe2\x80\x99s fair and foul and in the Shackles the Pirate\xe2\x80\x99s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\xe2\x80\x99s orders every captain has to answer to the council. Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you but that\xe2\x80\x99s not an easy feat. For a start wherever there\xe2\x80\x99s power there\xe2\x80\x99s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\xe2\x80\x99ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally you\xe2\x80\x99ll attract a host of powerful enemies. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t earn the patronage of a pirate lord the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\xe2\x80\x99t ask questions. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got cargo to deliver rivals to punish ports to defend and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\xc2\xa0 According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\xe2\x80\x99t buy happiness but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\xe2\x80\x99s chum in the water you\xe2\x80\x99ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\xe2\x80\x99re eager to earn her patronage then you\xe2\x80\x99d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders. A few notes about ACG OP: 1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we are sure we have space for but if there is more interest we can almost certainly make more room. So please sign up for the wait list if you want to play. 3.

If you\'re used to 10-pin bowling don\'t think duckpin bowling will be easy: the game uses shorter and squatter pins and a significantly smaller bowling ball making it more difficult to achieve a strike." \xc2\xa0Are you ready for a "bowl" down memory lane?

An intensely personal journey into the past that offers vital lessons for the future Prague Winter combines the intimacy of an autobiography with the drama of an exciting and well-told story\xe2\x80\x94all underpinned by the gravity and intelligence of a serious work of history. The result is a highly readable and incisive work filled with tragedy and triumph a resonant narrative informed by Albright\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable life experience and her characteristic candor in speaking hard truths. NOTE: \xc2\xa0Google Play has a special edition of this book for $6.99. \xc2\xa0The blurb for the e-book states "The enhanced e-book includes ten video interviews and one audio clip with Albright. \xc2\xa0In this special edition Albright reveals how this book is different from any other book she\'s written and pores over personal photos family documents and even a Slovak costume that she wore as a young girl to tell you the stories that bring these artifacts to life."

Presented in chapters UNITY takes an in-depth look at what it truly means to be human to be mortal and to be incarnate in this world. The film explores our brief existence among the Cosmos (Chapter I) then moves on to the perceptions of our Mind (Chapter II) the nature of our Body (Chapter III) the infinite capacity of our Heart (Chapter IV) and ultimately to the mysterious energy of the Soul (Chapter V). Initially these chapters will appear unrelated to each other. But as the film progresses it becomes clear that all life is interconnected and each chapter represents the totality of our mortal experience which is only measured in decades. With a cast of 100 voices all speaking as one voice UNITY is a genuine cinematic experience unlike any other., Cinemark Towson and XD, Towson, 111 E Joppa Rd, -76.600182, 39.401985"|

If you have not hiked this trail email me and tell me about your hiking experience and if you have any night hike experience. 2) We all need a light preferably a head lamp so your hands are free. 3) We all need to bring sufficient water - 1 liter minimum. 4) You are responsible for yourself. I will keep a close eye on everyone and have a sweeper. But ultimately you are responsible for yourself and must speak up if you have an issue. 5) Smile and have fun! \xc2\xa0 *********** AND NOW THE FUN STUFF *********** Wildlands map: http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/pdfs/GFSP_big2.pdf Total distance will be about 4.6 miles. There is one moderate hill at the beginning. After that it is mostly flat with gentle hills and three stream crossings of any significance. This trail is commonly used for trail running so it is wide well worn and one of the more comfortable ones to do at night. Please plan to be able to keep up at 2.5 to 3 miles per hour pace.\xc2\xa0 This is not a paved trail. We will step off at 6:45PM. Meet at the Northern most part of the GPL parking lot to the right of the restaurant if you are facing the restaurant. Dogs are welcome on this hike but they must be well behaved and on lead at all times. Long hiking pants are highly recommended! The group usually grabs a drink afterward at Gunpowder lodge or another nearby restaurant.

There is one moderate hill at the beginning. After that it is mostly flat with gentle hills and three stream crossings of any significance. This trail is commonly used for trail running so it is wide well worn and one of the more comfortable ones to do at night. Please plan to be able to keep up at 2.5 to 3 miles per hour pace.\xc2\xa0 This is not a paved trail. We will step off at 6:45PM. Meet at the Northern most part of the GPL parking lot to the right of the restaurant if you are facing the restaurant.

Meetup.com has rated us as one of the Best Outdoor Recreation Meetups in the world and currently ranks CKA as the largest most active kayaking dedicated Meetup Group in the United States.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to get out and paddle we are one of the most active kayak clubs in the Baltimore/Washington area but we are so much more than a Meetup Group.&nbsp; During the prime kayaking season we offer several events every week and are constantly looking for ways to offer more.\nOne of CKA\xe2\x80\x99s main goals is to make kayaking with the safety and camaraderie of a group accessible to everyone regardless of their skill level or the type of boat they own.&nbsp; Many of our paddles do require the proper skills and gear for safety\xe2\x80\x99s sake but we try to offer a lot that don\xe2\x80\x99t.&nbsp; Our Wednesday Night Paddlers are a great example of those that don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t have your own kayak that isn\xe2\x80\x99t a problem.&nbsp;

When weather and water conditions allow we get out on the Chesapeake Bay itself and it\xe2\x80\x99s tidal tributaries.&nbsp; You won\xe2\x80\x99t find our events on whitewater rivers or 3 foot white capped waves in the Bay but we have lots of members that appreciate growing their skills in more challenging waters.\nOur season usually runs from sometime in March or April through November or December depending on the weather.&nbsp; Over the winter when water temperatures get cold and dangerous some members switch to hikes to stay active as a group.&nbsp; Those members with cold water gear do still get out and paddle occasionally on warmer days.\n2014 will be our Organizer Chuck\xe2\x80\x99s 7th year organizing kayak trips in a venue like Meetup.&nbsp; He is an American Canoe Association (ACA) certified instructor who has been kayaking for 20 years.&nbsp; His experience includes 7 years as a kayak instructor and member of the management team for LL Bean\xe2\x80\x99s Outdoor Discovery School.&nbsp; His passion for kayaking brings lots of joy to his life and he loves to share it with others.&nbsp; We Jokingly refer to him as Fearless Leader after a character from the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon show which some of you may remember.\n\nMany of our members met while paddling with a Yahoo Group known as The Wednesday Night Paddler.&nbsp; It was an opportunity for people to paddle with a group on Wednesday nights after work.&nbsp; We worked on our skills and staying in shape while paddling off the day\xe2\x80\x99s stress.&nbsp; As everyone made new friends the Wednesday night paddles also become quite a social event.&nbsp; They still continue in that tradition.\nWe charge an annual membership fee but it is TOTALLY voluntary.&nbsp; You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay anything to paddle with us if you have your own kayak and gear.&nbsp;

This approximately 3 hour course is designed for those who are new to kayaking or those who have been kayaking for a while with no formal instruction. \xc2\xa0It is guaranteed to make your time on the water a lot more safe and enjoyable. The first 30 \xc2\xa0minutes will be outdoor classroom instruction on shore. \xc2\xa0The rest of the time will be spent in kayaks on the water. \xc2\xa0 A minimum of 3 students is required for the class to take place. \xc2\xa0The class will be offered at least twice a month during June July and August. The cost of the class is $49.00 for those with their own kayaks. \xc2\xa0Rental kayaks along with a paddle and PFD are available for an additional $15.00. Chuck is the instructor for this class. \xc2\xa0He is an American Canoe Association certified kayak instructor with 20 years of experience in a kayak including 7 years as a kayak instructor and member of the management team with LL Bean Outdoor Discovery Schools. The soft launch at Solley Cove Park is yet another result of the efforts of the Anne Arundel Public Water Access Committee. \xc2\xa0Finding this launch site is a little tricky. \xc2\xa0It's at the end of a dirt road by the Curtis Bay American Legion. \xc2\xa0Follow the signs for the American Legion and the paintball park. Solley Cove is located on Marley Creek which flows in to the south side of the Baltimore Harbor just west of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in an area known as Curtis Bay.  To reserve a rental kayak for the class simply answer the rental question when you RSVP. \xc2\xa0You can bring cash to the class to pay the additional $15 for the kayak rental or just change the PayPal amount to $64.00 when you pay online. The boats used for the course are quite new $1400 - $1600 real sea kayaks. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0They cost an average of about $1000 more than the kayaks used in many other courses offered in the area and give students the opportunity to learn and do much more in a kayak than the cheaper boats can.\xc2\xa0 You must pay the class fee at the time you RSVP. \xc2\xa0No refunds will be given of you cancel less than 24 hours before the class. \xc2\xa0Credit will be given towards future course offerings if you cancel more than 24 hours before the class. \xc2\xa0The class is held rain or shine except in the most inclement weather., Solley Cove Park, Curtis Bay, 7360 Carbide Rd, -76.569145, 39.186054"|

Mattawoman is one of the better nature paddles we do and the Saturday of this event is special at Mattawoman because it is one of the few times on a summer weekend that the tides will be right to paddle in what I call the flooded forest in addition to seeing the end of the American lotus bloom. \xc2\xa0It\'s when when the tides are absolutely perfect to get way back in to all of the nooks and crannies. \xc2\xa0It\'s the best time to see all of the varied plants and wildlife that Mattawoman has to offer. This should be a relatively easy paddle for anyone who can keep the paddle moving for about four hours with a stop out of our boats for lunch and a couple of breaks on the water. While numerous other places are better known for their wildlife Mattawoman can hold up to the best of them.\xc2\xa0 It was as\xc2\xa0though the bald eagles sat and posed for us making it easy for\xc2\xa0me to get the picture to above with my little waterproof Olympus point and shoot.\xc2\xa0 If you\'re a nature paddler this one is for you. Mattawoman looks like it\'s a long way away on the map but traveling on I-295 thorough DC takes me just an hour to get there.\xc2\xa0 Our "On The Water Time" is set so we can ride the incoming high tide back into all of the nooks and crannies where the wildlife hangs out. \xc2\xa0Don\'t be late for this one because if we wait for you we will miss the tides so we won\'t wait. Please remember that our start times are the ON THE WATER TIME.\xc2\xa0 Please arrive early enough to have your boat and gear ready to\xc2\xa0paddle promptly\xc2\xa0at 10:30 AM.  The total distance paddled will probably only be\xc2\xa07 or\xc2\xa08 miles at a relatively slow pace as we weave through tree falls and other obstacles to get as far back in as we can.\xc2\xa0 Composite boats are fine for this paddle but you may find yourself occasionally waiting on one side of a log with only a couple inches of water clearance while the rest of the group in plastic boats checks out what\'s on the other side.\xc2\xa0 Plan on being on the water\xc2\xa0 4 to 5\xc2\xa0hours and pack a lunch for a break somewhere along the way. There are rental boats available for this paddle at a special holiday price of $55.00 for the day delivered to the put in with paddle and PFD.\xc2\xa0 To reserve one just answer the rental question when you RSVP., No venue'|

We will begin on land with yoga and stretching exercises and perhaps Chi Gong concentrating from our hara (core or belly). Then on the water we will continue with stretching exercises while seated in kayaks. Once we have loosened up we will paddle upriver with guided meditation for a short distance. Then kaykers will have the opportunity to concentrate on their individual paddling techniques. This would be a good time to plan ahead to practice particular strokes you would like to work on. The paddle upriver will be in silence to support the meditative process. We will paddle about two miles then stop for a ten-minute meditation session on land before lunch.\xc2\xa0Silence will be optional at lunch and on the downriver paddle. You are required to wear a PFD and bring a whistle.\xc2\xa0Bring water lunch/snacks a hat and sunscreen comfortable clothes that could get wet and sandals/water shoes. 11:00 AM is on the water time so be sure to arrive with plenty of time to unload your kayak and get ready. There are no bathroom facilities at Daniels Dam. We should be off the water by 2:00PM. Kayaking involves known and unanticipated risks including physical injury and death that cannot be eliminated without jeopardizing the essential quality of the sport. Group organizers and leaders and other members cannot pay continuous attention to all participants. Participants must be responsible for their own safety. Don\xe2\x80\x99t overestimate your skills and abilities. Take instructional courses to learn about paddling technique safety self-rescue and hypothermia. Be aware of the tides currents and weather conditions that will affect your safety on the days you paddle. Cooperate with group organizers leaders and other members to insure your own safety as well as the safety of others and make it the fun enjoyable day on the water it should be., Patapsco River - Daniels Dam, Ellicott City, 2114 Daniels Rd, -76.815559, 39.313762'|

Rental kayaks are available to those who think they can go the distance at a rate of $55.00 which includes the PFD and paddle. \xc2\xa0Just answer the rental question when you RSVP to have one waiting for you at the put in., No venue'|

Waiver: Mountain biking is a risky sport By signing up for this meetup you are agreeing to our waiver located here:\xc2\xa0http://www.meetup.com/MVD-Mountain-Bikers/pages/Standard_Waiver_for_Meetup_Rides/ With the days getting longer we will probably not need lights but it may be a good idea to have one with you in case we get delayed on the trails. \xc2\xa0As the days get longer so will the ride! Where/Directions: Rockburn Elementary School What time: Meet between 5:45 and 6:00 at parking lot. Wheels rolling by 6:00. We will not wait past 6:00. \xc2\xa0 Pace: Pace will be Intermediate approx. 6.5 to 7 mph. Appropriate for average to riders but not for beginners or people who are not riding at least once a week. \xc2\xa0Attitude is laid-back and friendly but please ensure you can handle the pace and length of this ride before committing. This is a no-drop ride i.e. we wait up for everyone at intersections. (Note: if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to wait up for slower riders this is NOT the ride for you but please also survey your current fitness as no one likes to be the one person holding up a larger group). \xc2\xa0Please also note Ptap rides tend to be about 1 mph slower than Rosy or Fairland due terrain. \xc2\xa0 Terrain: Ranges from Easy to Difficult. Most trails are in great shape but plan on some mud spots. There are a few very steep climbs rocks and technical sections log overs (up to 10" logs and 3\' stacks) tight single track (12" wide in spots) and a stream crossing or two. \xc2\xa0A strong/advanced rider will be able to clean most sections others will need to get off of their bikes in spots. \xc2\xa0This is a friendly ride so we will wait up for everyone just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places. \xc2\xa0This is a video edit I made from last fall through winter. \xc2\xa0We won\'t hit all of this terrain but gives you a feel for Patapsco: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M Distance:\xc2\xa0With days getting longer we will be minimally getting 10 miles and if conditions and light allow we will push towards 20. \xc2\xa0Exact route will change depending on group dynamics trail conditions daylight etc. \xc2\xa0I will typically have route planned in my head at the beginning of the ride but will modify as needed to get us back at a reasonable time. \xc2\xa0 Duration: I shoot to have us back before it gets dark (so 2 to 3 hours as the days get longer). \xc2\xa0This can change with mechanical issues and group dynamics though. \xc2\xa0As this is a weekday ride the stops will be just long enough for the last rider to catch their breath. \xc2\xa0Note: wheels roll at stated time so please don\xe2\x80\x99t be late. Bring: Helmet (required) water (as much as you can carry) spare tube/patch kit pump/CO2 multi-tool I.D. emergency contact info where it can be easily located on your person and a good attitude as this ride is as much about camaraderie as it is about riding. Take a look at your bike and make sure it is in good working condition (Ptap will take its toll on the bike). \xc2\xa0Bring a light as you might need it. \xc2\xa0There are ton of acceptable lights under $20 on Amazon right now. \xc2\xa0Just look for a T6 Cree LED Bike light with minimially 1000 lumens. \xc2\xa0Here is a link to one: Cheap 1000 lumen bike light&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006QQX3C4/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=3FJIG6WZ09712&amp;coliid=I15GIMB04YOTYI"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Weather: Shine Only (there will undoubtedly be some mud but no ride if it\xe2\x80\x99s raining or the trails are too muddy).

Appropriate for average to riders but not for beginners or people who are not riding at least once a week. \xc2\xa0Attitude is laid-back and friendly but please ensure you can handle the pace and length of this ride before committing. This is a no-drop ride i.e. we wait up for everyone at intersections. (Note: if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to wait up for slower riders this is NOT the ride for you but please also survey your current fitness as no one likes to be the one person holding up a larger group). \xc2\xa0Please also note Ptap rides tend to be about 1 mph slower than Rosy or Fairland due terrain. \xc2\xa0 Terrain: Ranges from Easy to Difficult. Most trails are in great shape but plan on some mud spots. There are a few very steep climbs rocks and technical sections log overs (up to 10" logs and 3\' stacks) tight single track (12" wide in spots) and a stream crossing or two. \xc2\xa0A strong/advanced rider will be able to clean most sections others will need to get off of their bikes in spots. \xc2\xa0This is a friendly ride so we will wait up for everyone just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places. \xc2\xa0This is a video edit I made from last fall through winter. \xc2\xa0We won\'t hit all of this terrain but gives you a feel for Patapsco: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M Distance:\xc2\xa0With days getting longer we will be minimally getting 10 miles and if conditions and light allow we will push towards 20. \xc2\xa0Exact route will change depending on group dynamics trail conditions daylight etc. \xc2\xa0I will typically have route planned in my head at the beginning of the ride but will modify as needed to get us back at a reasonable time. \xc2\xa0 Duration: I shoot to have us back before it gets dark (so 2 to 3 hours as the days get longer). \xc2\xa0This can change with mechanical issues and group dynamics though. \xc2\xa0As this is a weekday ride the stops will be just long enough for the last rider to catch their breath. \xc2\xa0Note: wheels roll at stated time so please don\xe2\x80\x99t be late. Bring: Helmet (required) water (as much as you can carry) spare tube/patch kit pump/CO2 multi-tool I.D. emergency contact info where it can be easily located on your person and a good attitude as this ride is as much about camaraderie as it is about riding. Take a look at your bike and make sure it is in good working condition (Ptap will take its toll on the bike). \xc2\xa0Bring a light as you might need it. \xc2\xa0There are ton of acceptable lights under $20 on Amazon right now. \xc2\xa0Just look for a T6 Cree LED Bike light with minimially 1000 lumens. \xc2\xa0Here is a link to one: Cheap 1000 lumen bike light&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006QQX3C4/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=3FJIG6WZ09712&amp;coliid=I15GIMB04YOTYI"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Weather: Shine Only (there will undoubtedly be some mud but no ride if it\xe2\x80\x99s raining or the trails are too muddy). Protect our trails and don\xe2\x80\x99t ride them when they\xe2\x80\x99re fragile. There may be days where I make a last minute call so watch this page and our Facebook group on days where there is a chance of rain. Ride Organizer(s): Craig P.

Here's a few links of lights I have bought:\xc2\xa0Click Here and\xc2\xa0Here Meeting near playground when entering the main driveway make a left keep going until you see a building which are the bathrooms. Please comment on what time you will be attending when you RSVP Video of Fairland from a couple of years ago first loops tends to be like the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0pq6ygIbw About Fairland: 95% non-technical ride with few major climbs and no mandatory obstacles (they all have ride-arounds). Promise no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete but it's not rocks and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs and balance on the boardwalks and some good flow trails. First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate/Fast: This pace will try to not stop often only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned! 2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total depending on group pace will be Casual/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending): This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people at least most of us.\xc2\xa0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us patience is needed from the faster riders if you wish for a fast competitive pace this is not the ride for you. 2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm. Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping. What to bring: Plenty of water helmet (no helmet no ride) your mtb of course! multi-tool (although you can borrow mine) patch kit extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel) a snack if you're doing both loops.

I welcome beginners who are familiar with Patapsco terrain. What: Casual to Intermediate Pace at Patapsco State Park. Where: Patapsco State Park Avalon Area via the CCBC Catonsville Tennis Court Parking Lot #6. We want to roll as close to 10am as possible so please arrive a few minutes before to be ready to roll.

Some of the trails are fairly smooth and there are a few steep climbs rocks and technical sections and a stream crossing or two just be advised that the terrain can be very difficult in places. Distance: Looking at 13-15 miles (depending on group). At least half of it is down hill (ha-ha!). Duration: Approx. 3\xe2\x80\x934 hours depending on group dynamics trail conditions wait-ups mechanicals and/or number of breaks (we will take at least one 10\xe2\x80\x9315 min. break to refill if needed).

From the MORE Epic Website:\xc2\xa0Link to more site\xc2\xa0 Back for its 2nd edition the Patapsco Epic is coming bigger and better than ever in 2015! This extended mountain bike adventure showcases the world class trail systems of Patapsco Valley State Park. With tons of steep descents and climbs this course is by far the most technical and challenging of MORE's Epic Rides. Keep in mind this ride is not a race. You'll be able to enjoy it at your own pace but you will need to be in shape to successfully complete this difficult ride. Support for each course includes a detailed map well-marked course trails killer aid stations and a post-ride party with a meal ticket to fuel up after your Epic ride. All the net proceeds going directly back to the local trails so you'll be riding toward better trails and having a blast doing it! The Patapsco Epic's General Terrain-The Patapsco Valley State Park follows a steep valley stream with trails snaking up and down each side of the valley. Expect the excitement of a roller coaster as you'll be going up and down most of the time with very little flat terrain when on the single track. Many climbs are 1/4 to 1/2 mile in length with some quite steep ascents. The trails are also somewhat rocky and rooty not so much that you feel that you are on rocks all day but enough that you know they are there. This makes for a challenging course! Although no one section is excessively demanding the course keeps you working most of the time with very little flat or road sections to rest on. You'll know you're an Epic rider when you successfully complete one of the following courses: The 15 Miler-\xc2\xa0Perfect for experienced beginners or riders who couldn't commit to consistent training leading up to the event to enjoy a taste of the Patapsco Epic riding experience. Expect your adventure to last approximately 2-3 hours. The 25 Miler-\xc2\xa0This course will showcase the McKeldin Woodstock Alberton &amp; Daniels Areas. Expect your adventure to last about 4-5 hours for a beginner with a high level of fitness intermediate or advanced rider. The 35 Miler-\xc2\xa0This course will showcase the McKeldin Woodstock Alberton Hollofield Rockhaven Pickall &amp; Daniels Areas. Expect your adventure to last about 5-8 hours for an intermediate to advanced rider. The 50 Miler-\xc2\xa0This course will showcase the McKeldin Woodstock Alberton Hollofield Avalon Rockhaven Pickall &amp; Daniels Areas. Expect your adventure to last about 7-10 hours for an intermediate to advanced rider. This course will be beyond Epic and will redefine what you think is Epic! Camping *New for 2015*-\xc2\xa0Get a few extra hours of sleep before your Epic ride by camping at the Patapsco Epic! Camping will be available on-site at McKeldin the evening of Saturday (Aug 8) into Sunday (Aug 9). Camping is $20/night and offers a rustic setting (restrooms but no electric or showers available). Camping is limited to the first 50 campers and to tents only (sorry no RVs pop-ups). All campers must arrive by 8 pm Saturday evening as the park gates will be closed overnight. There are two large communal fire pits and cooking grills available (No personal fire rings in the tent area). MORE will provide fire food. NO ALCOHOL WILL BE PREMITTED AT CAMPSITES. Please leave any valuables at home or in a locked car as MORE will not be responsible for your belongings. Camping passes are available on Bike Reg when you register for your ride. Post Ride Party-\xc2\xa0After completing one of the Patapsco Epic rides what could make your day any better? A post-ride party of course! Come enjoy the festivities from 12 PM - 8 PM including 2 free beers (must be 21 or over) compliments of New Belgium Brewery a meal ticket to your choice of food truck and some of the best mountain bike company around! That's right new for 2015 food trucks will be on-site to offer a wider variety of meals. Post-ride party included for paid participants and volunteers but we encourage you to bring family and friends to help celebrate your Epic day. Additional passes may be purchased on Bike Reg when registering for your ride.

There are a few very steep climbs rocks and technical sections log overs (up to 10" logs and 3\' stacks) tight single track (12" wide in spots) and a stream crossing or two. \xc2\xa0A strong/advanced rider will be able to clean most sections others will need to get off of their bikes in spots. \xc2\xa0This is a friendly ride so we will wait up for everyone just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places. \xc2\xa0This is a video edit I made from last fall through winter. \xc2\xa0We won\'t hit all of this terrain but gives you a feel for Patapsco: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M Distance:\xc2\xa0With days getting longer we will be minimally getting 10 miles and if conditions and light allow we will push towards 20. \xc2\xa0Exact route will change depending on group dynamics trail conditions daylight etc. \xc2\xa0I will typically have route planned in my head at the beginning of the ride but will modify as needed to get us back at a reasonable time. \xc2\xa0 Duration: I shoot to have us back before it gets dark (so 2 to 3 hours as the days get longer). \xc2\xa0This can change with mechanical issues and group dynamics though. \xc2\xa0As this is a weekday ride the stops will be just long enough for the last rider to catch their breath. \xc2\xa0Note: wheels roll at stated time so please don\xe2\x80\x99t be late. Bring: Helmet (required) water (as much as you can carry) spare tube/patch kit pump/CO2 multi-tool I.D. emergency contact info where it can be easily located on your person and a good attitude as this ride is as much about camaraderie as it is about riding. Take a look at your bike and make sure it is in good working condition (Ptap will take its toll on the bike). \xc2\xa0Bring a light as you might need it. \xc2\xa0There are ton of acceptable lights under $20 on Amazon right now. \xc2\xa0Just look for a T6 Cree LED Bike light with minimially 1000 lumens. \xc2\xa0Here is a link to one: Cheap 1000 lumen bike light&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006QQX3C4/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=3FJIG6WZ09712&amp;coliid=I15GIMB04YOTYI"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Weather: Shine Only (there will undoubtedly be some mud but no ride if it\xe2\x80\x99s raining or the trails are too muddy). Protect our trails and don\xe2\x80\x99t ride them when they\xe2\x80\x99re fragile.

Second loop might get dark near the end but there will be a bail point before that at mile 5. Bring something bright enough to see! Here's a few links of lights I have bought:\xc2\xa0Click Here and\xc2\xa0Here Meeting near playground when entering the main driveway make a left keep going until you see a building which are the bathrooms. Please comment on what time you will be attending when you RSVP Video of Fairland from a couple of years ago first loops tends to be like the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0pq6ygIbw About Fairland: 95% non-technical ride with few major climbs and no mandatory obstacles (they all have ride-arounds). Promise no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete but it's not rocks and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs and balance on the boardwalks and some good flow trails. First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate/Fast: This pace will try to not stop often only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned! 2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total depending on group pace will be Casual/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending): This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people at least most of us.\xc2\xa0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us patience is needed from the faster riders if you wish for a fast competitive pace this is not the ride for you. 2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm. Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping. What to bring: Plenty of water helmet (no helmet no ride) your mtb of course! multi-tool (although you can borrow mine) patch kit extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel) a snack if you're doing both loops. Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page we always appreciate any feedback write a group review!(\xc2\xa0Here ), Fairland park, Fairland, 3928 Greencastle Rd, -76.93045, 39.081276"|

We will be trimming some trees weed-whacking and cleaning the parking lot. If you have a weed-whacker (and safety glasses) or a push-broom please bring them along. We also need to clean up inside lay some self-adhesive tile and do a little painting.\xc2\xa0 We are starting earlier than usual because it is going to get hot and we need to do the outside work first. We will have plenty of water on hand and an air-conditioned room for everyone's comfort. You don't need to spend the entire day - come for a couple of hours if you can.

I do have a few ground rules I must cover first: 1. This is a 21+ meetup! I do not want to go to jail for any underage drinking.2. I must ask you keep away from my parents liquor cabinet downstairs. I will have drinks available or you can BYOB.3. If you have to throw up please do so outside or in the bathroom. I will have the meetup upstairs with access to our porch outside instead of downstairs. I don't want to clean that up! DX4. If you are driving please keep in mind how much you drink I do not want to be responsible for any drunk driving that occurs. Failure to follow any of these rules will be banned from my house. I am responsible for everyone attending and want to make sure that everyone feels safe while having fun as well. I also may want to do another one of these in the near future. Thanks Ya'll!, Mad Matt's house, Severna Park, 54 Cypresspointe Ct., -76.536957, 39.072685"|

Although it has its roots in Irish and Scottish music based on the number of early refugees from these countries that settled in the Appalachians the form it takes today is purely American. The folks who first sang bluegrass (or mountain music as it was known then) were fairly isolated from the rest of the country so they sang about their own communities the hard life in the Appalachians and the beautiful country that surrounded them feeling blessed to live there. The Annapolis Bluegrass Coalition is a premier bluegrass band from Annapolis. A love of bluegrass music is deeply ingrained in the hearts and souls of these five world class musicians and they have been winning the hearts of bluegrass fans from all who have heard them play. Using the tools of their trade banjo fiddle mandolin guitar and bass fiddle the Annapolis Bluegrass Coalition offers traditional and contemporary compositions laced with three part harmonies and bluesy solos.\xc2\xa0 Indeed soul is the very essence of Annapolis Bluegrass Coalition and best describes how they play. It is evident during their performances. Rarely do you see artists that enjoy what they do as much as the Annapolis Bluegrass Coalition. Their warmth and interaction with the audience makes you feel as if they are playing just for you and that\'s just what they are doing. \xc2\xa0Listen to them perform "Blue Moon of Kentucky:" https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=62&amp;v=txCAjfJMDCc, No venue'|

We will view this documentary and then discuss the main question that it raises: Why are there so many churches yet so many problems in African American communities? African Americans are considered by sociologists and demographers to be the most religious ethic group in the United States but is also a group impacted by many social and economic problems. This discrepancy underscores the ineffectuality of religion and the futility of faith in Black America., Baltimore Ethical Society, Baltimore, 306 W Franklin St, -76.62037, 39.294926'|

So the problem has to be with the woman not being near there phone. n If you are signed up for a cruse the next day you should have you phone or computer near so you can get in touch with those that are trying to get in touch with you. n Bart will be able to take out a crew of 4 people. He will meet people at Baltimore Yacht Club 10:30am this Sat 22nd. Pier is B8.

Lake Kittamaqundi the downtown heart of Columbia. For many years the path only went only part-way around the lake. But this fall the Columbia Association completed the circuit and we can now walk around the entire lake along a new paved path! This walk is very flat only one gentle hill and 1.5 miles around. We\'ll pass by the People Tree the lakefront stage and long-established Columbia restaurants like\xc2\xa0Clyde\'s and Tomato Palace. You will basically head for the new Whole Foods of Columbia (added in Fall 2014) across from the Columbia Mall. However we will park and meet in the lower lot down the hill and to the right of Whole Foods (as you look at it from the front.) This is actually the parking lot for the new Haven on the Lake spa. Please park in the area furthest from the spa entrance as shown on the map below so that we are closest to the trail and won\'t get in the way of the spa clients.  SAFETY &amp; COURTESY Please\xc2\xa0arrive early to allow the dogs time to sniff and form their pack.

Bring a potluck dish to share. A potluck dish is a substantial main dish salad or side/dessert item. Across the street from the church there is a Harris Teeter grocery store and about 1/2 mile away at one of the traffic circles is a Food Lion grocery store.\xc2\xa0 This may be an option if\xc2\xa0you are coming from your church\'s worship service and need to pick up an item to contribute to the potluck. You can also pick up take out food - a bucket of chicken or side items a few sub sandwiches of $5 footlongs from Subway a carry out order of chinese food - you don\'t have to cook....although delicious homemade casseroles and salads are much appreciated!!

The road becomes a recreational area for walking running biking and the like.\xc2\xa0 In the warmer months many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\xc2\xa0 The views of the water and the surrounding\xc2\xa0wooded areas\xc2\xa0are wonderful all year round. It is an "out and back" hike can\'t possibly get lost bite off as much as you want to chew. The total distance is approximately 3 and 1/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour so that you can probably be home before noon if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like. \xc2\xa0Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It technically is not a park at all. In other words no potty facilities no pavilions etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there. To get there if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That\'s what you want. Don\'t go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike. Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so you bear right/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce\'s Plantation/Landing/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it\'s had some turnover in recent years)\xc2\xa0is located.\xc2\xa0 Peerce\'s address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\xc2\xa0Rd past Peerce\'s it\'s just plain wrong !!!\xc2\xa0Once you enter the park the meeting place is about a mile down the road. This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road. When you see this sign you\'ve found the right place.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\'ll meet right behind it by where you see the guy/rock.\xc2\xa0  Loch Raven Drive\xc2\xa0is a normal well paved road so there is no need for "off road" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\xc2\xa0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\xc2\xa0 However I am not aware of any sanctioned\xc2\xa0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can\'t recommend it.\xc2\xa0 It would be free style. I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we\'re all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit. If you decide to respond "Yes" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason pleaseplease go in and change your RSVP to a "No". That way we know not to be waiting for you. Thanks. So come join us on Sunday for a brisk walk in the park.

In other words no potty facilities no pavilions etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there. To get there if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That\'s what you want. Don\'t go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike. Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so you bear right/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce\'s Plantation/Landing/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it\'s had some turnover in recent years)\xc2\xa0is located.\xc2\xa0 Peerce\'s address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\xc2\xa0Rd past Peerce\'s it\'s just plain wrong !!!\xc2\xa0Once you enter the park the meeting place is about a mile down the road. This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road. When you see this sign you\'ve found the right place.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\'ll meet right behind it by where you see the guy/rock.\xc2\xa0  Loch Raven Drive\xc2\xa0is a normal well paved road so there is no need for "off road" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\xc2\xa0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\xc2\xa0 However I am not aware of any sanctioned\xc2\xa0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can\'t recommend it.\xc2\xa0 It would be free style. I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we\'re all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit. If you decide to respond "Yes" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason pleaseplease go in and change your RSVP to a "No". That way we know not to be waiting for you. Thanks. So come join us on Sunday for a brisk walk in the park. It\'s a great way to clean out the cobwebs and start a Sunday. \xc2\xa0, corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road, Baltimore, 12460 Dulaney valley road 21131, -76.546143, 39.468628'|

The road becomes a recreational area for walking running biking and the like.\xc2\xa0 In the warmer months many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\xc2\xa0 The views of the water and the surrounding\xc2\xa0wooded areas\xc2\xa0are wonderful all year round.

We enjoy activities such as biking kayaking group walks festivals concerts exploring cool places and sharing good eats &amp; drinks. Our one simple goal is to have FUN!\nWe chose the name Second Half Rally because all of us share that life situation chronologically even though we don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like it. But you probably qualify if you have some gray hair you OUGHT to have some gray hair you\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten your real hair color or the Men\xe2\x80\x99s Hair Club has your number on speed dial. If you\xe2\x80\x99re basically a kid who wants to go outside and have fun playing with friends then you\'ll fit in with our group.\nMembership in Second Half Rally is FREE. If you don\'t like something just remember that you get what you pay for...\n"Put me in coach! &nbsp;I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to play... &nbsp;TODAY!\xe2\x80\x9d\nWHY SECOND HALF RALLY?\nLife is the ultimate participation sport and we\xe2\x80\x99re all in the game whether we like it or not. During the first half of living in this world it\xe2\x80\x99s common to make rookie mistakes sign a long-term contract with the wrong team be stuck on the sideline training young recruits or suffer game-changing injuries to body mind and spirit. To make up for missed opportunities and bone-headed plays most of us need to step up our game as we take the field for the second half of our lives.\nIn short we need to stage a strong Second Half Rally! That means coming up with a better game plan getting off the bench and playing harder with a winning attitude. In this group you\'ll be playing with other winners who share the same gusto and adventuresome spirit!\nOUR GAME PLAN FOR ACTIVE FUN\nThe Second Half Rally meetup group has a straightforward game plan that respects the intelligence maturity and independence of its members:\n1. Our primary goal at every event is to HAVE FUN. Then we do something active to make it happen. Other groups tend to focus primarily on doing a specific activity like biking hiking or kayaking led by serious aficionados. Too often they never get around to having fun. Second Half Rally has its priorities straight.\n2. We don\xe2\x80\x99t tell our members how to have fun. Each event starts with an interesting idea and then people figure out how to have the most fun. It always works out.\n3. All of our activities are aimed at regular people who enjoy an active lifestyle for recreation. We pedal paddle and hike at a reasonable pace that works for anyone in decent shape.

It offers wonderful views and is an ideal place to celebrate the arrival of summer with refreshments and good company.\xc2\xa0 Naptown Locals blogger (and SHR member) Natalie Spong calls Coconut Joe\'s fresh orange crush "the best on the planet" which is high praise indeed. She also loves the scenic location and welcoming ambience for all age groups. Check out Natalie\'s review: http://naptownlocals.com/coconut-joes/ The food at Coconut Joe\'s is average bar fare but the drinks are great the wings are tasty and service at the lower Sunset Bar was friendly.

This time we\'ll explore the Severn River side of Annapolis that includes College Creek Weems Creek and two major highway bridges that cross the river.\xc2\xa0 After our paddle we can relax with refreshments and food at the Rams Head Roadhouse just a few miles away. Driving Directions We\'ll meet up and launch our kayaks at Jonas Green Park located by the Rt 450 bridge that crosses the Severn River to Annapolis. You can see the park down below as you approach the bridge on Rt 450 from Rt 50 East. To get there you\'ll need to turn left at the traffic light before the bridge onto Baltimore Annapolis Blvd.  The Google Meetup map above shows the address for the Severn Inn which is the best way to find our meetup spot. After turning left from Rt 450 onto Baltimore Annapolis Blvd at the light take the first right turn that leads down to the Severn Inn and Jonas Green Park.\xc2\xa0 The Jonas Green parking lot is straight ahead as you go under the bridge.\xc2\xa0If the parking lot is full check out the Severn Inn lot next door.\xc2\xa0We\'ll launch our boats from the designated kayak beach by the parking lot. There are restrooms and porta-potties at the park. Paddling Along the Severn River Our kayaking route from Jonas Green Park will be a relaxed pace crossing the Severn River under the Rt 450 bridge to College Creek a charming tributary that runs past St. John\'s College and the U.S. Naval Academy. Then we\'ll return to the Severn River and paddle a short distance to explore scenic Weems Creek a side of Annapolis most people never see.   After exploring Weems Creek our group will cross back to the eastern side of the Severn River protected by the pilings of the Rt. 50 bridge. Once there it\'s a straight paddle along the shore of the Severn River back to our starting point at Jonas Green Park. Total roundtrip distance for this paddle will be 7-8 miles. Bring a wide-brim hat sunscreen and cold water to stay hydrated. Skill Level This event is suitable for anyone who has good paddling skills. You must be able to\xc2\xa0paddle confidently while staying together with our group of kayakers for approximately three hours on the water. College Creek and Weems Creek are generally calm while the swells and waves on the larger Severn River are not normally too difficult. However the Severn River can get choppy due to wind and the wakes of passing boats so you must be prepared to handle some sizable waves and turbulent water.  ALL PARTICIPANTS MUST WEAR A PFD AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL SAFETY Our group of recreational kayakers look out for each other but we\'re not certified experts at rescuing novices. Our paddle events have been very successful because we stick together in case anyone needs assistance. Let\'s keep it that way! Kayak Rentals Kayak rentals at Jonas Green Park are available from\xc2\xa0Paddle or Pedal the park\'s boat rental concessionaire which has a limited number of kayaks that are mostly tandems. They\xc2\xa0charge $15 per hour for a single kayak and $20 per hour for a tandem kayak. An all-day kayak rental is $45 which is a good choice since we\'ll be on the water three hours or more. Call them at[masked] to find out what\'s available. Full details are available on the website:\xc2\xa0 http://www.paddleorpedal.com Post-Paddle at the Rams Head Roadhouse After the paddle we\'ll pack up our boats at Jonas Green Park and drive six miles to the Rams Head Roadhouse at 1773 General\'s Highway. It\'s a relaxed and fun place with good food and drinks that our SHR group enjoys. Full details with directions reviews and a map below: http://www.yelp.com/biz/rams-head-roadhouse-annapolis  Weather Considerations This event depends upon good kayaking weather. I\'ll post a notice here and send out an email by 9:00 am if we need to change plans or cancel. A little rain won\'t stop us and can add to the adventure but we won\'t paddle in excessive heat high winds or other dangerous conditions. Call Jake at[masked] with any questions.

It\'s an easy walking tour around Spa Creek to Eastport that will open your eyes to the wonderful lifestyle which has made Annapolis the center of good living on the Chesapeake Bay for 300 years. Our group does a similar walk during winter to experience the waterfront\'s stark beauty when its cold. This time we\'ll enjoy the lush green sights of summer by extending our walkabout to Eastport and Horn Point. Those who want to relax and see a bit of the harbor can return by riding the water taxi up Spa Creek to Acton\'s Cove Park which is just a few blocks from Reynolds Tavern. Heartier souls can return on foot by retracing their steps and walking up Main Street \xc2\xa0 Meet Up and Parking We\'ll meet in front of the Maryland Hall that\'s conveniently situated two blocks from West Street near the Westin Hotel. It\'s a converted high school that offers nice restrooms and plenty of FREE parking in the adjoining lots. Maryland Hall is the perfect spot to start our adventure!\xc2\xa0 Walkabout Route Several of us have explored Spa Creek by kayak enjoying the sights of beautiful homes impressive yachts and lovely nautical vistas. Now you\'ll find out what it looks like from land.\xc2\xa0Total walking distance is probably five miles but who\'s counting? Most people\xc2\xa0seeing Annapolis rarely venture beyond the stores and restaurants along Main Street and the City Dock area. They\'re missing some lovely nearby neighborhoods that offer a charming mix of historic homes newer structures tiny city parks tree-lined streets and abundant water views making this an ideal place for an afternoon stroll. The pace of life is peaceful and it\'s hard to believe downtown Annapolis is just a few blocks away. Starting from the Maryland Hall our SHR group will head towards Spa Creek and follow the shoreline neighborhood streets all the way to the 6th Street bridge that will take us over to Eastport. The streets generally end up at small waterfront parks so there are many nice views along the way.\xc2\xa0    Exploring the Eastport Waterfront On the other side of Spa Creek lies the Eastport neighborhood with its variety of maritime businesses and cool streets lined with historic homes. Eastport is on a peninsula framed by Spa Creek and Back Creek a few blocks away. At the tip facing the Chesapeake Bay is Horn Point one of the many waterfront parks in Annapolis.\xc2\xa0 Our group will stroll around Eastport to enjoy the laid back vibe catch the harbor views at Horn Point and refresh ourselves with food and drinks at the Boatyard Grill that\'s a favorite SHR happy hour destination.    Return by Water Taxi or Foot There is a convenient water taxi dock right across Chester Ave. from Davis\' Pub. The taxi boat will come pick up groups of three or more people on Back Creek at 15-25 minutes past the hour when phoned at[masked]-0033. The boat goes around Horn Point to City Dock and then up Spa Creek. It\'s not a long trip but the water taxi is a fun way to get off our feet relax and ride back enjoying the sights of Annapolis harbor the Naval Academy and all the impressive yachts and homes. You can even grab a drink at Davis\' Pub while waiting for it to arrive. On Spa Creek the water taxi can stop at Acton Cove for people who want to visit Reynolds Tavern. For those going directly back to their cars the taxi can stop at Amos Garrett Park which is just two blocks from Maryland Hall where we started.

We enjoy activities such as biking kayaking group walks festivals concerts exploring cool places and sharing good eats &amp; drinks. Our one simple goal is to have FUN!\nWe chose the name Second Half Rally because all of us share that life situation chronologically even though we don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like it. But you probably qualify if you have some gray hair you OUGHT to have some gray hair you\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten your real hair color or the Men\xe2\x80\x99s Hair Club has your number on speed dial. If you\xe2\x80\x99re basically a kid who wants to go outside and have fun playing with friends then you\'ll fit in with our group.\nMembership in Second Half Rally is FREE.

During the first half of living in this world it\xe2\x80\x99s common to make rookie mistakes sign a long-term contract with the wrong team be stuck on the sideline training young recruits or suffer game-changing injuries to body mind and spirit. To make up for missed opportunities and bone-headed plays most of us need to step up our game as we take the field for the second half of our lives.\nIn short we need to stage a strong Second Half Rally! That means coming up with a better game plan getting off the bench and playing harder with a winning attitude. In this group you\'ll be playing with other winners who share the same gusto and adventuresome spirit!\nOUR GAME PLAN FOR ACTIVE FUN\nThe Second Half Rally meetup group has a straightforward game plan that respects the intelligence maturity and independence of its members:\n1. Our primary goal at every event is to HAVE FUN. Then we do something active to make it happen. Other groups tend to focus primarily on doing a specific activity like biking hiking or kayaking led by serious aficionados. Too often they never get around to having fun. Second Half Rally has its priorities straight.\n2. We don\xe2\x80\x99t tell our members how to have fun. Each event starts with an interesting idea and then people figure out how to have the most fun. It always works out.\n3. All of our activities are aimed at regular people who enjoy an active lifestyle for recreation. We pedal paddle and hike at a reasonable pace that works for anyone in decent shape. We don\xe2\x80\x99t run endurance races or competitions and we take reasonable rest breaks. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be an athlete or a hardbody to participate but you must be able to keep up with everyone else. This is not a group for couch potatoes.\n4. Depending on the location our events start at 10:00 am or later to give people enough time to get there be relaxed and enjoy themselves. Beginning at a civilized time is part of having fun on a weekend. Unlike some outdoor activity groups we don\xe2\x80\x99t wake up the chickens when we leave home.\n5. We always accompany our events with good food and drinks. Taking time for refreshments and socializing with other members is an important way to make friends with people who share our interests.\n6. With this group there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to RSVP \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d unless you change your plans. Nobody expects you to show up at a specific event unless you RSVP \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d.\n7. All members post a clear personal photo showing their face so we can recognize each other at meetups to help build a comfortable sense of community.\n8. Our group is friendly and welcoming but we don\xe2\x80\x99t tolerate whiners jerks dorks or anyone else who spoils the fun for the rest of us. People who don\'t fit with the group are quickly removed from membership.\nWe still boogie! &nbsp;Do you? &nbsp;If so then join up!\n  ,Annapolis, outdoors-adventure, -76.5100021362, 39, Camping; Singles; Bicycling; Kayaking; Hiking; Dining Out; Paddling; Walking; Travel; Social Networking; Social; Outdoors; Weekend Adventures; Concerts; Exercise; Local Activities; ,3068792, 222871558, Free USNA Band Concert at Annapolis City Dock - Meet at the Federal House, 2015-08-04 21:30:00,  This nice mid-week event features a FREE final concert by the USNA band and its ensembles at City Dock.

This year we\'ll extend our walk to include the entire Promenade route from Canton to the Inner Harbor. \xc2\xa0 Free Parking at Canton Waterfront Park Canton Waterfront Park at 3001 Boston St. has an adjacent lot with a boat ramp where there\'s usually ample free public parking available. Don\'t park where your car might get hit by the trailers launching their boats. From there it\'s a short walk through the park to the BoatHouse Grille where we\'ll meet. Meet at the BoatHouse Grille The BoatHouse is an excellent new restaurant located right by the Promenade facing the waterfront. Great views good eats and drinks and plenty of room inside and outdoors on the patio. We\'ll gather in the outdoor patio area for refreshments and food before setting off for our walk to Fells Point and Inner Harbor. Full details and directions below. http://www.boathousecanton.com  Strolling Along the Waterfront Promenade From the BoatHouse Grille we\'ll pick up the Waterfront Promenade and head toward Fells Point. The promenade is a newly-developed area of beautiful walkways marinas apartments and docks that runs all the way to Inner Harbor. It\'s a popular destination for walking\xc2\xa0jogging and showing off dogs.\xc2\xa0There are excellent views of Baltimore harbor\'s ships and yachting marinas the whole way along with benches and scenic viewpoints to enjoy the waterfront ambience.\xc2\xa0 This is an easy sight-seeing walk with many places to stop or rest. Total distance will be approximately four miles. Our initial destination will be Fells Point and its many cool shops and pubs on Thames St. We\'ll then continue along the Promenade past the Pier Six Pavilion the Baltimore Aquarium and the Inner Harbor until we arrive at the newly-restored USS Constellation tall ship.    Return Trip by Water Taxi When we\'re ready to return we can catch the Baltimore Water Taxi from Inner Harbor back to Canton Waterfront Park\xc2\xa0where we parked our cars. On the way you\'ll see the famous Domino Sugar sign Fort McHenry and the sights along the harbor waterfront extending all the way to Canton. The taxi boat leaves every 15-20 minutes and costs $7.00.\xc2\xa0No credit cards so bring cash.

It\'s a nice facility with a scenic outdoor location on Back Creek its own beach a beautiful pier a nautical museum and good restrooms.\xc2\xa0 This event is one of the Museum\'s weekly Tides &amp; Tunes Summer Concerts featuring a variety of bands from around this area. The featured group this week is D\'Vibe &amp; Conga a popular local band that plays a mix of good time tunes and even some Jethro Tull. We saw them play at the barBAYque festival in May. They were very talented and entertaining.\xc2\xa0  Although the Museum\'s concerts are technically free a $10 donation is expected. That\'s a fair price for having a relaxing evening of good music and a nice social vibe by the water. Beer wine mixed drinks and food are available for sale. No coolers are allowed but be sure to bring your folding chair or blanket.  The summer concert series on Thursday evenings is an excellent reason to get out of the house and have some FUN.\xc2\xa0We\'ll plan to meet around 6:00 pm to find a place to sit and mingle before the concert starts at 7:00 pm. Look for us having a good time or call Jake at[masked]-8435. I can\'t always answer my phone at events but you can try.

Rueda de Casino. Does that have something to do with gambling? Nope. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dance. Originating in Cuba in the 1950s Rueda de Casino typically consists of multiple couples dancing synchronized moves in a circle intermixed with frequent partner changes. Rueda is the Spanish word for wheel (dancing in a circle); casino is the Cuban term for the place that you would go to dance: the dance halls not synonymous with the English definition of casino. No gambling involved! We\xe2\x80\x99re already familiar with\xc2\xa0Sheena Black\xc2\xa0Cher Jey and\xc2\xa0Oscar Rousseaux presenting us with the movements that define what it means to be Afro-Cuban at\xc2\xa0The Living Well. Let\xe2\x80\x99s continue the momentum by participating in another popular Cuban dance style with those oh-so-familiar Latin beats that we\xe2\x80\x99ve all come to love in salsa\xe2\x80\xa6 The music RDCB brings will be like salsa but with more\xe2\x80\xa6 groove. Funk. Sabor! What can you expect from a RDCB Party? In a word: vibrancy. This friendly group has dancers of every age every race and every ability. Their mission \xe2\x80\x9cto increase awareness interest and appreciation of Afro-Cuban music and dance in the Baltimore area and the Latin Dance community.\xe2\x80\x9d And what if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know the dance? Rueda de Casino Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s founder Cedric Teamer has an impressive r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 boasting his skills for bringing Baltimore the best Latin music mix and providing the city with the only Cuban based dance school in this area. RDCB has hosted at various Latin Dance venues in the city. They also regularly host public social events and classes; they\xe2\x80\x99ve even performed at Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s renown Artscape in 2014 and here at The Living Well this past May. On Sunday August 30th at 4PM Rueda de Casino Baltimore will be at The Living Well once again. A dance class by casino group Fuakata from New York will present an hour-long class before open dancing begins and the hottest Son Songo Salsa Cubana and Timba will be played by none other than\xc2\xa0Dj-dola Yorubaontwo(co founder of SalsaUnderground Washington DC) and RDCB's own TIMBA TITAN !Consider yourself taught!

Used in ancient Chinese palaces and temples and also in the tradition of Kundalini Yoga Gong Meditations also called Gong Baths are deeply nourishing and restorative. Similar to an extended savasana the softer sounds are soothing on a deep level and as the sound level builds the body and energy are cleared in profound ways. Through the intense vibrations of the sound the body and mind are able to relax and surrender to the healing energies of the Gong and as the waves of sound wash over participants a deep energetic clearing occurs leaving the participant feeling balanced peaceful and light. Class led by Angela Blueskies.  Angela Blueskies is a Songkeeper sound healer and medicine woman. A lifelong musician she received her training as a classical flutist at the prestigious Peabody Institute in Baltimore. In her performing career she began to long for a deeper sense of connection and presence with her audiences. It was while travelling in South America that Angela first encountered traditions that worked with songs and music for healing and transformation. Deeply influenced by sacred ceremonies from Peru and the traditions of bhakti yoga and kirtan she began to experiment with creating music for healing and meditation. Expanding beyond her background as a classical flutist in her sound healing sessions Angela also works with voice toning and mantra as well as frame drum rattles flutes from around the world singing bowls and the gong. Her Sound Medicine Journeys are intuitively guided energy healing sessions that use song music and sound to bring clearing balancing and a higher vibration of peace and joy to all those present. In addition to her work with Sound Medicine Journeys she also leads kirtan with several wonderful musicians in the Baltimore/Washington area including her band Bhakti Tree.

We focus heavily on learning Italian appreciating Italian culture and we have members of all levels of proficiency from beginners to native speakers. Beginning speakers are very welcome but will need to self-study and also feel comfortable coming to groups where intermediate and native speakers will be talking quickly. In our small conversational groups members who attend will practice one on one with other beginner intermediate and fluent speakers in a comfortable low-stress environment and the pairings will be switched regularly to keep the meetup moving along provide the maximum amount of practice and opportunities to get to know more members. If you need more resources aside from Duo Lingo don\'t hesitate to contact me. \nIf you\'re interested in Italian culture BUT you don\'t want to learn Italian or don\'t have the time right now then this isn\'t the group for you. Passatempo &amp; Piazza Italia are two D.C. groups with thousands of members that have many fun events and you don\'t need to be a fluent speaker to attend them. There is also a Montgomery County group that will have a monthly event for beginning speakers starting in the fall. \nAnyone is welcome to suggest new types of meetups and organize them. Since this is my first meetup group feedback is much appreciated. The events that we do regularly are 3-4 conversational groups per month the monthly world language cafe at Wegmans and pizzeria and restaurant nights out which are very popular! There is always room for more types of events like happy hours a book club and concerts plays and carpooling down to some of the events in D.C. and Montgomery County. Spero di vedervi presto!

We use smaller tables that are near to each other. At each small table we'll have two speakers and roughly every 15-20 minutes we'll shift people one spot over so there is a new pairing each time. This way people of all levels can practice together and also get to know each other. Switching pairs also keeps things interesting and the meetup moving right along. When beginning speakers listen to intermediate speakers talking with each other that helps you pick up the correct cadence and pronunciation. Same goes for intermediate speakers listening to native speakers. Beginners can learn from intermediate and native speakers. Intermediate speakers can learn by teaching beginners and also by listening to native speakers. And our native speakers are doing us a great community service. ;), No venue"|

Our restaurant nights out are always fun &amp; full of laughter and sharing stories. Their menu is here. The special for Monday night is buy one entree get one pasta for $5. Couples very welcome! They have two or three locations so make sure you come to the one on Plum Tree Drive in Ellicott City and NOT the one in Catonsville or Baltimore. This place has a different ambiance than your local pizzeria but we might keep it on rotation if you all continue to like it.

Gordon Lightfoot is playing at the Pier 6 Pavilion which is an outdoor stage on the pier.\xc2\xa0 Tickets for Pier 6 cost $35-$85 each. We will not be buying tickets.\xc2\xa0 Instead we\'ll be sitting about 150 feet away in front of the Marriott where we can watch the concert for free on what might be called "Pier 7". We will not be alone--this is a popular summertime activity!\xc2\xa0 The advantages of watching a concert from the Marriott are: \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa2 FREE! \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa2 You can bring your own food and drink and enjoy a little picnic before and during the show. It does come with a few disadvantages that aren\'t that major IMO but I would like to let you know what they are so I don\'t get any complaints :-) \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa0It will be crowded and we will have to get there early to find a good place to sit. \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa0We\'ll be able to hear the music and see the stage lights but we won\'t really be able to see the performers. \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa0The only option if you need to use the restroom is to walk to a local business since there are no facilities out on "Pier 7". *** GAME PLAN FOR WEDNESDAY *** With all that said here\'s what you need to do on Wednesday to enjoy the show: 1. Get there early.\xc2\xa0 I plan to get there by 6:30.\xc2\xa0 If you want to be sure you can sit with the group I suggest getting there before 7.\xc2\xa0 If you arrive and there\'s no space to sit with us there\'s nothing I can do about that. 2. Use the restroom before you arrive. 3. Bring a camp chair and picnic supplies including food and drink.\xc2\xa0 Sharing is optional.\xc2\xa0 I would guess alcohol is technically not allowed on the public pier but you will see plenty of it and no one seems to care.\xc2\xa0 I suggest being as discrete as possible though for example if you bring wine keep the bottle in a paper bag pour it into plastic cups and keep it down low when pouring. 4. Be prepared to enjoy the evening.\xc2\xa0 The show doesn\'t start until 8 pm so we\'ll have a lot of time to sit and picnic. 5. The long term weather forecast is upper 80\'s.\xc2\xa0 I plan to bring an umbrella just in case although at the moment it doesn\'t look like rain. 6. You can park in the Little Italy parking garage on the corner of S Central Ave and Bank St for $4 after 4 pm.\xc2\xa0 It\'s about a 7 block walk to the Marriott Pier. 7. I\'ll email my cell # to everyone Wednesday morning.\xc2\xa0 Call if you have trouble finding us.\xc2\xa0 Note however I\'ll only be taking calls until 8 pm--after that I plan to turn my phone off so I can enjoy the picnic and concert. 8. If you have any questions please post them below in the comments. See everyone on Wednesday!, Baltimore Marriott Waterfront, Baltimore, 700 Aliceanna Street, -76.602791, 39.283066'|

Mead is an alcoholic beverage similar to wine but honey is used instead of grape juice. Let\'s go see their facility get a tour and sample some of their products! You can\'t beat learning and having fun at the same time :) They don\'t have food but you are welcome to bring some and certainly bring friends! They have an open happy hour so the more the merrier! The tour is free...and $8 for a flight of 4 meads. Roughly a drink\'s worth. I am sure Charm City Meadworks would love it if you left the premises with a bottle or two or more! This is a joint meetup with the Charm City Social Club group. http://www.charmcitymeadworks.com/ \n\n\n, Charm City Meadworks, Baltimore, 3511 8th Ave, -76.573967, 39.231701'|

The game on Aug 18 is against the Mets. If the weather is nice we\'ll meet at the ballpark and buy tix together in the upper bleachers where we can enjoy the sunset while watching the game. Full details will be posted the Sunday before the game. Hope you can join us! ----------------------------------- UPDATES: Here\'s some logistical info: 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Bring $10 cash meet at 6:20 pm. 2. I\'ll email my cell phone number to everyone Tuesday morning.\xc2\xa0 Check your email and if you don\'t have it by noon on Tuesday please contact before 2 pm at https://secure.meetup.com/messages/?new_convo=true&amp;member_id=5312826&amp;name=Allen 3. We\'ll meet at 6:20 pm at the memorial at the corner of W. Lee Street and Ravens\' Walk (the pedestrian walkway between the Ravens\' and Orioles\' stadiums). The memorial is inscribed "Time Will Not Dim the Glory of Their Deeds". The exact location is marked by the red (or green) thingy on this map: https://maps.google.com/maps?daddr=39.28206-76.6207&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=17&amp;t=h 4. At 6:30 pm sharp we\'ll walk up to the ticket window together and buy tickets.\xc2\xa0 Please bring $10 in CASH to pay for your ticket. 5. If you\'re running late call me on my cell before 6:30 pm and we\'ll either wait a few minutes for you or we\'ll head in and let you know where we\'re sitting. 6. You can park at the stadium for $8.\xc2\xa0 Again bring cash. 7. If anyone would like to ride up with me from the Laurel/Columbia area please let me know.\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to be leaving as soon after 5 pm as possible--definitely no later than 5:15. 8. You\'re allowed to bring your own water soda and snacks into the stadium. Those are often nice to have. 9. A baseball cap is a good idea. It shields your eyes from the overhead field lights and makes it easier to see. 10. It will be sunny and hot Tuesday with a small chance of scattered showers.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll get tickets in the shade and under the roof so any sun or passing rain won\'t bother us :-).

Jim Gaffigan is performing at the Pier 6 Pavilion which is an outdoor stage on the pier.\xc2\xa0 Tickets for Pier 6 cost $40-$80 each. We will not be buying tickets.\xc2\xa0 Instead we\'ll be sitting about 150 feet away in front of the Marriott where we can watch the performance for free on what might be called "Pier 7". We will not be alone--this is a popular summertime activity!\xc2\xa0 The advantages of watching a show from the Marriott are: \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa2 FREE! \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa2 You can bring your own food and drink and enjoy a little picnic before and during the show. It does come with a few disadvantages that aren\'t that major IMO but I would like to let you know what they are so I don\'t get any complaints :-) \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa0It will be crowded and we will have to get there early to find a good place to sit. \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa0We\'ll be able to hear the music and see the stage lights but we won\'t really be able to see the performers. \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa0The only option if you need to use the restroom is to walk to a local business since there are no facilities out on "Pier 7". *** GAME PLAN FOR TUESDAY\xc2\xa0 *** With all that said here\'s what you need to do on Tuesday to enjoy the show: 1. Get there early.\xc2\xa0 I plan to get there by 6:30.\xc2\xa0 If you want to be sure you can sit with the group I suggest getting there before 7.\xc2\xa0 If you arrive and there\'s no space to sit with us there\'s nothing I can do about that. 2. Use the restroom before you arrive. 3. Bring a camp chair and picnic supplies including food and drink.\xc2\xa0 Sharing is optional.\xc2\xa0 I would guess alcohol is technically not allowed on the public pier but you will see plenty of it and no one seems to care.\xc2\xa0 I suggest being as discrete as possible though for example if you bring wine keep the bottle in a paper bag pour it into plastic cups and keep it down low when pouring. 4. Be prepared to enjoy the evening.\xc2\xa0 The show doesn\'t start until 8 pm so we\'ll have a lot of time to sit and picnic. 5. The long term weather forecast is upper 80\'s.\xc2\xa0 I plan to bring an umbrella just in case although at the moment it doesn\'t look like rain. 6. You can park in the Little Italy parking garage on the corner of S Central Ave and Bank St for $4 after 4 pm.\xc2\xa0 It\'s about a 7 block walk to the Marriott Pier. 7. I\'ll email my cell # to everyone by 2:30 pm on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 Call if you have trouble finding us.\xc2\xa0 Note however I\'ll only be taking calls until 8 pm--after that I plan to turn my phone off so I can enjoy the picnic and show. 8.

Whether your interest is recreational or competitive our coaching staff will train you in safety timing and technique until you\'re zipping through the water paddling in perfect unison with your teammates 20 paddles one boat!\nThe first practice that you attend is free and each additional practice after that is $5.00. \xc2\xa0If you decide to join the club membership costs $125 per season.,Baltimore, sports-recreation, -76.6299972534, 39.2700004578, Paddling; Breast Cancer Survivors; Boating; Outdoor  Fitness; Water Sports; Dragonboating; Dragon Boating; dragon boat racing; Recreational Paddlers; ,13979272, jtmpglytlbqb, Open Practice, 2015-08-12 22:15:00, *** If you are attending this practice please don\'t forget to sign up on our website by clicking the "Sign Up" link at the top. *** The BDBC open practices occur every Wednesday from 6:15 to 7:30 PM and Saturday mornings from 8:30 to 9:30. For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable: - The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we\'re out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won\'t mind getting wet in. - As far as footwear goes some people like to paddle barefoot some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water it\'s not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly. - The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses sunscreen gloves and a hat. - Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone. - There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car/on land. - There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone\'s car keys when we get on the boat. - The point of our open practices is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible all while having a whole lot of fun!

People like to say we should live in the moment. But what does that actually mean? According to Buddha\xe2\x80\x99s liberating teaching on subtle impermanence the moment is all there really is! This profound insight cracks open our customary way of looking at our lives\xe2\x80\xa6in the best possible way. Even a glimpse of subtle impermanence brings with it a letting go of our usual grasping at what we consider to be our problems and our limitations. It frees us to fully embrace every moment of our lives. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Guest Teacher:\xc2\xa0As one of the most senior teachers of Kadampa Buddhism Kadam Lucy has taught extensively in England Florida and San Francisco and helped set up many thriving Buddhist meditation centers for the past 33 years. Kadam Lucy is well-loved for her deep experience clear mind and inspiring yet practical presentation of Buddha\xe2\x80\x99s teachings and meditations showing how to make these immediately effective in our modern daily lives., KMC Maryland Temple, Baltimore, 900 East Northern Parkway, -76.603989, 39.364784"|

After about a half hour of collecting we will regroup and caravan over to a local residence for a power point presentation on wild mushroom hunting ethics taxonomy mycomedicinals field guide interpretation and other wondrous facts about the 5th kingdom. Next we will apply our new knowledge by working with Michael to identify all the mushrooms we collected. You\xe2\x80\x99ll need to bring drinking water a knife small trowel small-medium paper bags and be able to keep time so you don\xe2\x80\x99t wander too far. If you are serious about pursuing mushroom knowledge you should have and bring a field ID guide at the very least. The three that I carry if weight is not an issue are National Audubon Society Field Guide to Mushrooms Simon &amp; Schuster\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to Mushrooms and the Peterson Field Guide to Mushrooms. They are listed in my preferred order first being my favorite. Mushroom cultivating supplies will be for sale by Michael but is in limited supply. If you have specific requests email him at least one month prior to the workshop follow the web link above for contact info. We will be doing a mushroom cultivation workshop later this year. That workshop will be hands on and full of tricky ways to use already available material to cultivate mushrooms as well as how to extend a kit you already have or start from a mushroom you found or purchased. **For full workshop details and to register visit: http://www.charmcityfarms.org/mushroom-identification-101-2/ **, No venue'|

Holiday 2012 Club photo THE HISTORY OF TOASTINGAncient tradition is full of colorful tidbits. Every day around the world cultures celebrate honor and signify meaningful events with toasts usually involving a libation heartfelt words and the clinking of glasses. Whether toasting the Almighty the head of state the wedding party or an award recipient we toast for health wealth happiness safe passage healing or any of a number of noble and sometimes frivolous aspirations. Yet few people know the history behind this ritual. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tradition that began centuries ago. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ancient Hebrews Persians and Egyptians were toasters as were the Saxons Huns and other tribes\xe2\x80\x9d Paul Dickson writes in his book Toasts: Over 1500 of the Best Toasts Sentiments Blessings and Graces. In his 18th-century history book The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire Edward Gibbons wrote about toasting Dickson notes. Gibbons described a feast among the Huns at which their leader Attila led no less than three rounds of toasts for each course of an elaborate dinner. Ancient Greeks drank to each other\xe2\x80\x99s health and welfare. In The Odyssey Ulysses drank to the health of Achilles. The idea of poison\xe2\x80\x94which was a potent weapon in the sixth century B.C.\xe2\x80\x94also came into play. According to David Fulmer\xe2\x80\x99s book A Gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to Toasting toasting was \xe2\x80\x9ca good faith gesture to assure the drink wasn\xe2\x80\x99t spiked with poison.\xe2\x80\x9d The best way to prove a drink was safe for sipping was to take the first sip. Just as a handshake assured others that nothing was hidden up one\xe2\x80\x99s sleeve drinking a shared libation in front of others signified to all its worthiness for consumption. The Romans built upon this Greek custom of drinking to others\xe2\x80\x99 health and well-being: They added toasted bread crumbs to their goblets reducing the acidity of the often bitter wine. Thus came the appellation \xe2\x80\x9cto toast\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 referring to the drink itself\xe2\x80\x94from the Latin term \xe2\x80\x9ctostus\xe2\x80\x9d meaning \xe2\x80\x9cto dry up" or "scorch." In Rome "drinking to another\xe2\x80\x99s health became so important the Senate decreed that all diners must drink to Augustus [the first Roman emperor] at every meal\xe2\x80\x9d Dickson writes. \xe2\x80\x9cFabius Maximus [the Roman politician and general] declared that no man should eat or drink before he had prayed for [Maximus] and drank to his health.\xe2\x80\x9d The Clinking of GlassesThe toasting custom spread throughout Europe and England where for the first time the clinking of glasses accompanied the ritual. Whether its intent was to mix the content of each other\xe2\x80\x99s glasses so everyone drank the same grog (lessening the likelihood of being poisoned) or to add sound to the experience of taste touch smell and sight no one is sure. In the 17th century toasting became very popular says Dickson. Eventually the position of \xe2\x80\x9ctoastmaster\xe2\x80\x9d emerged. In England the toastmaster presided over events delivering and soliciting appropriate toasts. \xe2\x80\x9cIn those days the duties of the toastmaster tended to be referee-like in that his main function was to give all toasters a fair chance to make their contribution\xe2\x80\x9d writes Dickson in his book. He adds that one of the earliest books on toasting\xe2\x80\x94if not the earliest\xe2\x80\x94was The Royal Toastmaster by J. Roach published in London in 1791. Roach\xe2\x80\x99s view was that the toast is a very powerful ritual. Consider this passage from his book: A Toast or Sentiment very frequently excites good humor and revives languid conversation; often does it when properly applied cool the heat of resentment and blunt the edge of animosity. A well-applied Toast is acknowledged universally to soothe the flame of acrimony when season and reason oft used their efforts to no purpose. To this day one can find the National Association of Toastmasters in the United Kingdom\xe2\x80\x94whose trained members wear ceremonial red dinner jackets and are skilled at oratory poetry and toasting. They emcee events of all varieties from weddings and funerals to christenings and fundraisers. Dickson describes a Golden Age of toasting in America during the 40-year period from approximately 1880 to 1920. Many prominent authors wrote toasts toast books and pamphlets were published and newspapers ran columns on the subject. One periodical The National Magazine had its own Toasts editor whose duties included judging the best toasts in a monthly contest Dickson says. Traveling ToastsWorldwide numerous nations and cultures have their own toasting customs. Many are similar to each other yet others are unique. For example in Japan China and Korea the customary toasts sound very similar but are pronounced differently. According to the Matador Network (www.matadornetwork.com) a site devoted to travel journalism toasters in Japan say the word kanpai and pronounce it \xe2\x80\x9ckan-pie\xe2\x80\x9d; in China they say gan bei and pronounce it \xe2\x80\x9cgan bay\xe2\x80\x9d; in Korea they say gonbae and pronounce it \xe2\x80\x9cgun bae.\xe2\x80\x9d And Korean toasting customs differ from the Japanese. \xe2\x80\x9cIn Korea the glass is emptied and the last few drops are shaken out then it is passed to the guest and the host refills the glass\xe2\x80\x9d says the website Etiquette International (www.etiquetteinternational.com). \xe2\x80\x9cA glass is never refilled until it is completely empty in Korea whereas in Japan the glass is constantly refilled so it is never empty.\xe2\x80\x9d If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make a toast in another country notes the site be sure to find out the toasting customs there \xe2\x80\x9cbefore putting your foot in your mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cToasts don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily translate well especially if they are idiomatic or poetic\xe2\x80\x9d adds Etiquette International. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to stick to safe topics like friendship the enjoyment of life and health.\xe2\x80\x9d The ancient and international tradition of toasting is no doubt one that will endure for many more years. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope the future of the toast is as engrossing as its past., Historic Oliver\'s Carriage House, Columbia, 5410 Leaf Treader Way, -76.853661, 39.223598'|

Please post in your RSVP what food item u will be bringing so we can have an idea of what will be served. Also this is BYOB. This event will be hosted at our home and we do own a dog.. so if you are not dog friendly please be advised. You may want to bring a pop up chair to place on the deck as I\xe2\x80\x99m unsure if we will have enough seating for everyone. Come and bring a friend that may be interested in geocaching. You will hear stories of the hobby we all love so much hopefully peaking your interest.We have lots of games on hand\xe2\x80\xa6 so between the swapping of geocache stories let\xe2\x80\x99s get some games going where we do not have to get covered in spider webs to get the prize.

Then let's play Pictionary! Draw things to try to make your friends guess words. If you've never played before the game goes something like this according to Wikipedia: The team chooses one person to begin drawing; this position rotates with each word. The drawer chooses a card out of a deck of special Pictionary cards and tries to draw pictures which suggest the word printed on the card. The pictures cannot contain any numbers or letters nor can the drawer use verbal clues about the subject he/she is drawing. The teammates try to guess the word the drawing is intended to represent.

Tibetan singing bowls. Crystal bowls.; ,18578143, brwnhlytlbdc, Sound Bath, 2015-08-22 23:00:00, Sound Healing is an effective and proven modality that uses vibrational sound to help reduce stress alter consciousness and create a deep sense of peace well being and better health. Sound tools entrain the brain to move into the deeper Alpha and Theta brain wave frequencies. These are the frequencies that induce deep meditative and peaceful states clarity of mind and intuition. Sound frequency impacts the sympathetic nervous system as your brain waves synchronize to the sound vibrations. The harmonic vibrations engage the relaxation reflex and slow down the respiratory brain and heart rate and disrupt the pain reflex. Modern medicine can now measure and confirm the practice of sound as a means to promote healing. Thus sound is a type of energy medicine that creates the sacred space in which people can heal the body mind and spirit. I will be using many types of sound healing from ancient drumming to newer technologies of Crystal singing bowls. (maybe even some voice) You will either sit comfortably or lie on the floor and just be. All you need do is relax and listen and let your body feel the vibrations. You will feel rejuvenated and uplifted. See my webpage for a list of benefits of sound healing.http://www.rainbowreikihealing.com/Sound-Healing.html This is a donation based event. No one will be turned away if finances are an issue. All are welcome. , The Insight Center, Timonium, 2 Oakway Road, -76.625351, 39.439014'|

It can heal emotional and physical problems improve relationships and finances help you grow spiritually or just make life easier. It is the most advanced spiritual tool given to mankind to cleanse our karma without having to face or problems directly. As my mentor and teacher Liz Draman used to say "clear the trauma without the drama". It will literally clear the negativity around a specific situation illness etc. when invoked. It transmutes our karmic records into pure light. It has the power to transmute to change and raise energy that has slow vibration into energy of higher vibration. Decrees have a mystical power to them. They invoke the power and spirit of your innate divinity the power of God that resides within you. Decrees are spoken out loud and release the power of the Word through the throat chakra. Every time you speak a decree out loud you are drawing upon spirit so that God can act in your life in an expedient way. Benefits of the Violet Flame: Transform fear into courage Transform anxiety into peace Heal personal and planetary karma Clears karma at a cellular level Raises energy body to a higher vibration Spiritual accelleration Improves relationships Quickens the mind Accelerates personal growth Purifies negative energy Transforms families and communities Rejuvinates the physical body Transforms illness and more......

A\xc2\xa0Bodhisattva\xc2\xa0is someone who has developed bodhichitta which is a\xc2\xa0mind or heart focused first on the benefit of all beings and then on one\'s own individual enlightenment with the intention to attain that enlightenment to benefit others. Over the centuries this text has become one of most classic works describing the Bodhisattva path and the Mahayana (which emphasizes great compassion for all sentient beings)\xc2\xa0tradition. \xc2\xa0While in the monastery our teacher Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche studied this text under the guidance of learned masters over a long period of time. \xc2\xa0He has a very profound understanding of this work so this class will provide students with an in-depth analysis and understanding of what it means to follow the path of the Bodhisattva. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The class will continue on successive Tuesdays until we finish the text. There is a general focus on Buddhist philosophy and its tenets while we try to gain a more complete understanding of the path of enlightenment."The Way of the Bodhisattva" \xc2\xa0is available on Amazon.com. \xc2\xa0Here is the link:\xc2\xa0http://www.amazon.com/Way-Bodhisattva-Bodhicaryavatara-Shambhala-Classics/dp/1590303881/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440077041&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=way+of+the+bodhisattva \n\n You need not to have read the book nor own a copy to join in.

Let's try it! Just go to www.Pre-Dating.com/dc\xc2\xa0and enter PDPSMU to register and get your discount. By now you know it takes meeting a number of people before you find someone you click with. Sometimes it seems like hundreds! The problem is how do you meet them in the first place? There are bars blind dates dating services dating sites but they all have their disadvantages and they take time ... lots of it. Plus it's no fun to risk rejection over and over again striking up conversations with people who might not even be single if you even get the courage to speak to them. And if the conversation goes well it is still awkward exchanging phone numbers. With speed dating you meet up to 12 people (sometimes more) singles in your age range in about 2 hours. Afterwards if there's interest (you discreetly circle on your interest sheet who you would like to see again) you'll receive an email with links to contact these event participants. There's no pressure no rejection no embarrassment and no games. Why not try it? A meetup RSVP does not guarantee you a spot.\xc2\xa0 Save your spot at the next event at www.Pre-Dating.com/DC.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0People who show up without registering run the risk of being turned away at the door.\xc2\xa0, No venue"|

|b'10149152, 3, The DMV Photography Workshops, This is a group was created for anyone interested in learning more about digital photography from working professional photographers in and around the DMV area.\nYou know the type photographers you always said "Jeez I wish I could tag along with you to learn more. If you ever need a hand I\'ll work to learn." Well I never like throwing people into the mix until we had a chance to discuss your level and goals. If I\'m going to show you some things I want it to be for both our benefit.\nSo this group will cover things from equipment to understanding the subject to workflows to prints while shooting what we love to shoot after learning all the rules. You have to learn them so we can break them to make it your own art.\nThe DMV Photography Workshops has a 1275-3200 sq. ft. studio home base in Baltimore City at SkyloftFRentalStudio.com. &nbsp;Some of the workshops are also conducted by other groups and organizations because we want to keep our members informed of some of the best workshops know matter where or who is conducting them. The goal is to learn more about what we love any place. With that we also offer a 10% discount on Skyloft F Studio Rental time!\nSo if you are a professional photographer and would like to conduct a workshop showcasing how you do something please let us know. And members if you would like to see a particular workshop offered please let us no at anytime so we can grow as a resource.\nAll workshops are instructional and hands on training to help give you the complete "How &amp; Why?"\nIf you have any questions just drop us an email. You can also find us on FaceBook and our web site.\nThank you all!\n&nbsp;\n\n\n,Baltimore, photography, -76.5400009155, 39.2799987793, Digital Photography; Photography; Photography Classes; Boudoir Photography; Nature Photography; Portrait Photography; Location Photography; Model Photography; Fashion Photography; Studio Photography; Landscape Photography; Nude Photography; Glamour Photography; ,10149152, 224724318, "Light-Masters" Monthly Workshops: 1 to 3 People Only!, 2015-08-30 18:00:00, On numerous occasions we have been asked if they\'re one on one instructor lead workshops? Well we are now offering this once a month instructor lead series of workshops.\xc2\xa0 These workshops are designed for 1 - 3 shooters only and the organizer/instructor. Each participating shooter will have their own studio setup (lights reflector model etc.) and workshop objectives to complete in this 4 hour workshop.\xc2\xa0 All shooting levels are welcomed this is a great way to get your photography skills raised with "Hands-On" experiences while getting your questions answered while you work.\xc2\xa0 The most important element in photography is the light. So how you see it and how to use it to help create your vision is a key objective in our workshops. Know matter if you are a landscape or people shooter. The light can happen all at once or continuos the creative challenge remains the same.\xc2\xa0 So we will dive into "The Science and Art of Taking Pictures." And as always (but deeper) we will review items that make a good image: SubjectCompositionLight andExposure This series would be best if you have participated in one of our previous group workshops but not a requirement. Everything is geared towards your skill level and abilities. We do things "Hands-On!" Good ole multi sensory learning type approach. :) The list of what we are going to cover in each of these workshops is long but again it will be driven by the participants experience level and interests. But some of the items we will cover: Light and modifiersMix lighting setupsProper lens selection for outputCreating a storyboardSet designModel selectionModel PosingPost (Digital Darkroom and Workflows)Styling and Stylist selection The range in which we will be shooting the models in will be:\xc2\xa0 FashionFitnessGlamour Those three categories will give us a vast range of options with the models TDMVPW works with. The number of models depends on the number of participates and yes the models will rotate to each shooters setup. Once you RSVP there will be a few questions asked.

One of the most common areas of photography is portraiture you maybe asked often to take someone\'s picture. From the new couple to the new baby and even the new house hold pet. And from head shots to three quarter to full length portraits. Learning how to use the light in different environments and creating a pose that brings out the persons best is harder than it seems. You may have seen some wonderful poses and you\'ve probably seen some awkward looking portraits. Knowing the differences of a good pose based on the subjects body type and how to use light and posing to make your subject feel and look their best is key! We will be using daylight flash (mono-lights and speed lights) in the studio and on location. Creating poses in these different environments to get the best portrait possible. If you are just starting out or an up and coming shooting looking for know more about your camera light and posing for a better portrait this is the workshop for you. In this month\'s workshop we will shooting Anastasia Jessica Laurese and Liana. We hope to see you all there! , The Skyloft F Gallery and Studio, Baltimore, 3701 Bank Street #F, -76.565979, 39.287426'|

The term Twin Flame is becoming increasingly acknowledged and familiar in the realms beyond the metaphysical especially as the numbers of Twin Flame relationships seem to be increasing. But why now? \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6.. Oh what a special mission Twin Flames have on our planet and how important it is for them to come together at this time if the time is right for them! A Twin Flame is quite literally the soul\xe2\x80\x99s other half which parted before entering the 3rd dimensional experience and human incarnation. YET the Twin Flame Reunion cannot occur unless the other person is WHOLE \xe2\x80\x93 or at least it is much less likely to last if it does. So in this new old math \xe2\x80\x93 a HALF makes a WHOLE and TWO HALVES MAKE A WHOLE! How brilliant! Up until recently most Twin Flames did not generally incarnate at the same time (or rarely did so) but took turns supporting each other through respective human lifetimes. However at this special time on Earth Twin Flame partners are incarnating together in greater numbers with the special purposesof helping to maintain timelines protect and augment energies and move our world forward to what may be called the Golden Age of Gaia \xe2\x80\x93 quite literally Heaven on Earth! Yes despite what you may see on the news this is not only possible \xe2\x80\x93 but it is happening in the present moment of Now \xe2\x80\x93 where ALL change occurs! Hooray! Since many Soul Mate connections are also quite compelling familiar and strong how do you know whether you\xe2\x80\x99ve really found your \xe2\x80\x9cpartner of ultimate destiny\xe2\x80\x9d or Twin Flame? Would you like to know more about Twin Flames? Is it possible that you have found yours? Do you think you found him or her and then he or she \xe2\x80\x9cran\xe2\x80\x9d? How do you manifest your Twin Flame? What if you are already with someone else (or he or she is) and then you meet whom you believe to be your Twin Flame? Does everyone have a Twin Flame? What is the difference between a Twin Flame and a Soul Mate? HOW DO YOU ATTRACT YOUR TWIN FLAME? Find all of this out and more \xe2\x80\x93 and set more firmly-footed on the path to Grand Sacred Reunion with your Twin Flame. There are more ways to do so than you think! How quickly it happens is up to you. Find out how! Pay $25.00 at the door. See you at EarthTouch Healing Arts beloveds! \xc2\xa0Get ready to manifest your Twin Flame in the NOW - where all change takes place., EarthTouch Healing Arts, Dundalk, 2 Dunmanway Suite 231, -76.52227, 39.256428'|

This Meetup is a work in progress. \xc2\xa0We would love for you to be part of \xc2\xa0creating our manga/anime family. \xc2\xa0We would love for you to help us grow as a community. What is MangaTalk! MangaTalk is the Meetup to delve deeply into \xc2\xa0the Japanese (and related) Graphic Novel and Video World that we are so passionate about with others who are equally passionate. \xc2\xa0 Please take the time to fill out the questions here on Meetup to help us create a Manga/Anime Club that speaks to you! \xc2\xa0We will also have the survey at our 1st meeting if you don\'t have time to fill it out here. \xc2\xa0Then as a group we will develop the content for the next meetup We will be discussing the rules of the Manga/Anime club. Drawing! We will set time aside in the first meeting for manga/anime drawing. \xc2\xa0We just want to get a feel for whether drawing is going to be a part of our club since so many people interested in Manga/Anime do have fun with fan-art or creating their own characters. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 We will have art supplies available so do not feel like you have to bring any unless you want to. \xc2\xa0Please do not be intimidated by the art portion of our Meetup even if you are not an artist or are too shy to share your work. \xc2\xa0Like all Meetups at Amazing Spiral everyone is expected to treat each other\'s opinions and creative endeavors with kindness consideration and respect.

Warning there is some manga/anime that is not age appropriate for younger participants. \xc2\xa0 Manga and Anime are the fruits of a different culture and sometimes what would be considered "All Ages" by Japanese culture is not what we in the States would consider All Ages. \xc2\xa0If you are 12 and under please bring a Parent/Guardian to your first meeting to give permission for you to be in a Meetup where the discussion/viewing may tap into more mature subjects of a Teen+ nature.\xc2\xa0 \n\n\n\nLook for Spider-Man to find Amazing Spiral: Books Comics Toys GAMES &amp; More!

There is a path of knowledge\xe2\x80\x94true knowledge of Divine things and the acceptance of this truth.\xc2\xa0 There is also a pathway of action of organized activity which usually calls for change and choice the application of Principle.\xc2\xa0 And there are others. The shortest and most powerful pathway of all is the pathway of Love.\xc2\xa0 It is the pathway that is open to all irrespective of their personal condition or circumstance.\xc2\xa0 For every person everywhere this true attainment is obtained through the path of love.\xc2\xa0 And it is our union with God that makes this attainment possible.

It would seem that there is an endless flow of authors speakers and Spiritual Leaders prepared to deliver the latest insights and approaches to spirituality. From Deepak to Oprah everyone is spreading the news that there is a new approach to life being explored and the news is good. While there are several avenues to revelation we also understand that we must find common ground in our community and with others in order to honor every path without mandating that any single one is the final authority on individual spirituality. It\'s easy to get hung up on verbiage and opinion rather than commune in spiritual fellowship when the topic at hand is as close as our own soul. Religious Science is that common ground. It is a philosophy that lies back of all the opinion and approach of infinite possibilities. As a community it is important for us to be able to identify that common ground to bring us closer together and heal the divides caused by differences in pinion and approach. As an individual it is the greatest way for us to forgive those who have used their approach and opinions to injure harm or otherwise divide us from accepting our loving place within humanity... and to remember to save a place for them as well.\xc2\xa0 Our speaker this week is Reverend Brian Akers Senior Minister of the Columbia Center for Spiritual Living.\xc2\xa0 Come to this Meetup and see if CCSL is the spiritual community that you have been looking for. , The Hawthorn Center, Columbia, 6175 Sunny Spring, -76.884605, 39.207018'|

Creating a life of substance requires a foundation sturdy enough and strong enough to support whatever it is we choose to build while also being clear enough and simple enough not to limit the things we seek to create. Religious Science is a foundation of thought that allows our spiritual selves to be individual and connected all at the same time. To truly build something of great value and consequence in the world we must take a cue from nature. Like the elders of the earth our mighty trees let us grow tall and strong with unique and individual gifts to share while being deeply rooted in the soil that provides life for all. Let us move and be moved like the malleable yet sturdy branches that blow with the wind. Let us be one with each other and the world so that we thrive in a world that truly works for everyone.

|b'6682212, 2, Wyrd Weavers, Have you ever found yourself on a walk in the forest and suddenly come to a place that immediately felt special? Maybe there was some uniquely shaped rock or a tree that attracted your attention? Perhaps you thought for a moment that you could detect something as if there was some kind of presence on the particular site that you could not really explain? Many people testify that they feel a strong affinity with nature all around us that their strongest spiritual experiences are when they are moving through the forest.\nThis is not new of course. Humans have always had similar experiences since the origin of our species long long ago. Through the ages we have tried to understand and process these experiences tried to portray them and give them shape sought contact with the powers and the presence that we felt all around us. These experiences are the core of nature\'s religion.\nThose of us who closely identify with these experiences exert a natural spirituality and seek a community that share in these gifts. That is the foundation of our community. We seek a harmony with nature and the gods based on ancient traditions and practices. We use the term "ancient" but that does not mean that our religion is obsolete or outdated. We reaffirm the old traditions and ways developed by the people who have gone before us but develop them simultaneously adapting them to our time and in the modern conditions under which we live. When we use the word "ancient" we may also allude to that it is rooted in a mythical time when our ancient ancestors lived in true harmony with the earth.\nOur religion is polytheistic meaning that we recognize and turn to a variety of gods and powers. Among these gods and goddesses include Odin Freya Thor Sif and the others from the Norse mythology. Not all gods are Aesir - Freya is of the Vanir family moreover it is not just the gods and goddesses we turn but to nature spirits as the fey animal totems and so on. While we share a common religious foundation with the "Asatru" we understand that that this term is too narrow.\nWe recognize and celebrate these powers in rituals that we call blot. The blot can be considered as a symbolic celebration where we invite gods goddesses and beings to participate we offer them gifts and forming a relationship with them. A blot can be very simple and intimate but it can also be a big ceremony with many participants. Our festivals are tied to the seasons and we are also ceremonies surrounding life\'s rites of passage such as weddings funerals naming of children house blessings and much more.,Greenbelt, religion-beliefs, -76.8799972534, 39, Pagan; Asatru; Shamanism; Runes; Spiritual Growth; Transformation; Norse Mythology; Earth-Based Spirituality; Shamanic Journeying; Shamanic Training and Classes; Pagan Families; Norse Paganism; Heathenry or Heathenism or Heathens; Anglo Saxon or Germanic or Norse Religion; seidth; ,6682212, qrkjffytlbtb, Shamanic Journey Group, 2015-08-15 21:00:00, This class will have a special fire ceremony. If you can collect a few sticks from near your own home to put into the fire please bring them. If you do not have the opportunity to do so then no worries. Each meeting follows the Foundation for Shamanic Studies\' general approach for teaching and building Core Shamanism and teaches journey techniques for all levels. \xc2\xa0There is a discussion and topic presented with each class and these themes are integrated into the journey work. If you are new to journeying or are new to these classes please come 15 minutes early (see below). There is lore within the Eddas as well that sheds light on how the shamanic path was treated historically in Europe. While this class supports any religion and faith and requires tolerance to the diversity of religious traditions within cultures it does have more of a focus on classic mystery traditions. If you don\'t know how to journey please contact Christian (xtian) in advance although this step is not necessary. A brief introduction to journeying is available for beginners and experienced journeyers new to our group. \xc2\xa0If so please show up about 15 minutes early. This monthly journey group will help students of all levels build the divine connections to their teachers and/or power animals. Each session will consist of two journeys and will allow a community to share questions and have structured feedback on how to improve your skills in journeying as well as strengthen your subtle bodies for spiritual work no matter what your personal religious calling may be. $10 donation sliding scale is appreciated. \xc2\xa0Donations support the group meetups and our larger community events! Notes on what you should bring and requests: If you feel more comfortable lying down bring a yoga mat or comfortable pad that you wish. If you have a rattle or shamanic drum that is not too loud please do bring that. Bring a notebook and pen or some thing to take notes on! Bring water for personal hydration. \xc2\xa0Please try not to eat a very large meal immediately before the class. Heavy foods can interfere with this work especially if spiritual work is new to you. \xc2\xa0I do encourage a light snack however as a starving student can be equally distracted. Finally please be on time. \xc2\xa0We will spend the first 15 minutes sharing and learning and then begin our first journey. \xc2\xa0If you do arrive once the journeying has begun be quiet and respectful and take the time to journey for yourself. Be respectful and turn off all cell phones and pagers during the event., No venue'|

It\'s the August Multi-Organizational Business Networking Breakfast! Bring plenty of business cards and your appetite for a hot breakfast and structured networking. Here\'s how it works: When you arrive check in grab your name badge and take a seat. Breakfast will be announced shortly after you get settled (you may be able to grab a coffee before the food comes out). Make sure you are sitting with people that are new to you! Your first "rotation" will be with the initial people at your table so introduce yourself share information and collect/distribute business cards. Welcome announcements and acknowledgements will take place followed by two or three more rounds of networking. Each round will require you to get up from your chair and relocate yourself to another table where you will start the process all over again! Depending on the number at your table you will have between 60 and 90 seconds to introduce yourself and tell your tablemates about your business so prepare and practice your "elevator speech" early! This breakfast is hosted by the Baltimore Washington Corridor Chamber of Commerce and will be attended by chambers and business groups throughout the area. Did you know that Entrepreneur\'s Exchange introduced the concept of the "joint breakfast" years ago? It\'s like speed dating but you meet 8 to 10 new people in each round. EE participates in six or more joint networking breakfasts each year at different locations throughout the Baltimore/Washington area traditionally hosting the summer breakfast in Annapolis in June. Other participating organizations include local chambers of commerce business networking groups technology groups and more. Don\'t miss the opportunity to meet business owners and entrepreneurs from around the area and make a lot of connections - sign up for the next joint breakfast and see what all the buzz is about!, Maritime Institute & Conference Center 692 Maritime Blvd. Linthicum MD 21090, Linthicum, 692 Maritime Blvd., -76.668968, 39.213768'|

This is an exclusive event for Mud Puppy Jeepers. World Tour started as wrenching parties. It's come a long way from a driveway to a hobby shop in Odenton to a full service pro shop in Annapolis. In the spirit of not forgetting where we've come from I'd like to keep ahold of our wrenching party beginnings. This is where you all come in. So I'm looking to open our doors for a monthly wrenching party. Of course there is a bit of a catch. We want the lift kit to come from us. It'll be the regular retail price you'd pay anywhere else. The second catch is that you need to provide a minimum of four wrenchers. I don't care if you've never ever seen a wrench but you will know what one is by the end of the day. If for some reason you don't feel like it's for you to help with the wrenching this isn't a real problem. Just recruit four willing volunteers who are. If you can help yourself you only need to find three. I'll be able to do one of these a month if the interest is here. A few of the great companies we represent for lift kits. AEV (american expeditionary vehicles) metal cloak rock crawler currie teraflex pro comp synergy and fab tech. Four people with the right tools and direction can get a bolt on kit installed fairly quickly. Who's gonna be the first one?, World Tour Off Road Equipment, Annapolis, 1934 Lincoln Drive Unit J, -76.523354, 38.975033"|

Venue: DLA Piper is hosting us in their amazing space in Mt. Washington that can handle 200 or more people with plentiful parking and convenient access for those that live outside the city. What more can you ask? The DLA Piper building is in the Mt. Washington Conference Center campus (up the hill) and it is a totally amazing building. Check it out:  To get to the venue use the Smith street entrance (and not the entrance that weaves its way through the Mt. Washington Conference Center). See below map for detail.View Larger Map  Parking &amp; TransportationParking is plentiful and there\'s a lot right next to the building with plenty of room for all attendees. And it\'s free. What can be better? One favor tho -- leave the few visitor spots that are right in front of the building available for the use of the offices. They have some elderly clients who aren\'t able to walk up the walkway to the building. The lot is really big and very close so you shouldn\'t need those spots anyways. Public Transportation The Mt. Washington campus is located very conveniently near the Light Rail stop which is literally just down the hill from the venue. Get off at the Mt. Washington Light Rail station and then climb the steps to the Octagon Building at Mt. Washington and from there you can get to the DLA Piper building. It\'s a 15-20 minute walk at most. There are also shuttles from the JHU Homewood and JHMI campuses right to the Mt. Washington Conference center including one that leaves at 7:40AM from Homewood getting in by 8AM and leaving at 9:35AM to return to Homewood. Very convenient.

Winding from Georgia to Maine this uninterrupted \'hiker\'s highway\' sweeps through the heart of some of America\'s most beautiful and treacherous terrain. Accompanied by his infamous crony Stephen Katz Bryson risks snake bite and hantavirus to trudge up unforgiving mountains plod through swollen rivers and yearn for cream sodas and hot showers. This amusingly ill-conceived adventure brings Bryson to the height of his comic powers but his acute eye also observes an astonishing landscape of silent forests sparkling lakes and other national treasures that are often ignored or endangered. Fresh illuminating and uproariously funny A Walk in the Woods showcases Bill Bryson at his very best. \n\n\n\nThe A Walk In The Woods movie stars Robert Redford Nick Nolte Emma Thompson Nick Offerman and Mary Steenburgen. It opens on Labor Day Weekend. Let\'s read the book in August then see the movie in September. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSynopsis \n\n\n"Not long after I moved with my family to a small town in New Hampshire I happened upon a path that vanished into a wood on the edge of town." So begins Bill Bryson\'s hilarious book A Walk in the Woods. Following his return to America after twenty years in Britain Bryson decided to reacquaint himself with his native country by walking the 2100-mile Appalachian Trail which stretches from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine. The AT as it\'s affectionately known to thousands of hikers offers an astonishing landscape of silent forests and sparkling lakes--and to a writer with the comic genius of Bill Bryson it also provides endless opportunities to test his own powers of ineptitude and to witness the majestic silliness of his fellow human beings. For a start there\'s the gloriously out-of-shape Stephen Katz a buddy from Iowa who accompanies the similarly unfit Bryson on the trail. Once Bryson and Katz settle into their stride it\'s not long before they come across the fabulously annoying Mary Ellen whose disappearance ruins a perfectly good slice of pie a gang of Ralph Lauren-attired yuppies from whom Katz appropriates a key piece of equipment and a security guard in Pennsylvania who for no ascertainable reason impounds Bryson\'s car. Mile by arduous mile these latter-day pioneers walk America along the way surviving the threat of bear attacks the loss of key provisions and everything else this awe-inspiring country can throw at them. But A Walk in the Woods is more than just a laugh-out-loud hike. Bryson\'s acute eye is a wise witness to this fragile and beautiful trail and as he tells its fascinating history he makes a moving plea for the conservation of America\'s last great wilderness. An adventure a comedy a lament and a celebration A Walk in the Woods is destined to become a modern classic of travel literature. \n\n\n\n \n\n\nBook Availability at the Howard Count Public Library A Walk in the Woods is available for checkout at the Howard County Public Library. The Howard County Public Library has: (14) Copies of the book; 276 pages. (6) ebook copies. (3) Copies as books on CD. \n\n\nHoward County Library Central Branch 10375 Little Patuxent Pkwy Columbia MD 21044 (410)[masked] Branch Hours Mon. - Thurs. 10 am - 9 pm Fri. - Sat. 10 am - 6 pm \n\n\nDiscussion Questions \n\n\n1. One of the most interesting aspects of this book is the unlikely friendship between Bryson and Katz. What is the relationship based on? Consider especially the episode in Maine when Katz gets lost: somehow the friendship is altered. How does Bryson\'s attitude toward Katz change over the course of the book? How does Katz himself change? Or does he? What was Katz\'s motivation anyway to walk the AT? \n\n\n2. The book offers an excellent microscope through which to examine the meaning of friendship\xe2\x80\x94our own friendships. Do the two men remind you of friends who tested your patience but who exhibited intense loyalty? \n\n\n3. In fiction a journey usually symbolizes a journey of self-discovery\xe2\x80\x94at the end the protagonist comes to learn something about him/herself. Although A Walk isn\'t a novel do either of the men come to greater self-awareness by the end of their journey? \n\n\n4. The tone of the book veers back and forth between humor and seriousness even anger. In fact the book is a sort of jeremiad against environmental threats to the great wilderness areas of the country. Is Bryson\'s anger justified? He criticizes but does he offer solutions? Are there solutions? \n\n\n5. Katz pokes fun at rural Southerners which some readers find funny others find offensive. You? \n\n\n6. Bryson ponders the attraction of hiking: \'\'You have no engagements commitments obligations or duties; no special ambitions and only the smallest least complicated of wants; you exist in a tranquil tedium serenely beyond the reach of exasperation." If you\'re a hiker backpacker camper are your experiences similar to or different from Bryson\'s? For those who aren\'t hikers are there other avenues to "exist in a tranquil tedium"? \n\n\n7. You might also talk about the numerous characters Bryson and Katz meet on the trail. Mary Ellen is one for instance: how do you feel about their treatment of her?, No venue'|

For those of you who are wondering who is Robin Jacoby and why do we want to talk about Amazon with Robin. Here is a little more about her: Imogene asked me for a bio. So confusing. Did she want all the information like how I was employed as a clown while in grad school or that I appeared on national network\'s reality television show? Did she want to know my first job was as a gas pumper at a filling station and my last real job was Regional VP of Operations for a major assisted living company? I\'m not a regular person who\'s taken a normal path and I\'m not going to write a normal bio. So why don\'t we try this: I\'m 48% mouth. 86% risk taker. 86.25% careful analyst. 110% real. 0% statistical genius. I\'ve never done anything the way I was "supposed" to do it. I dropped out of high school at 16 and never went back. Without my GED or diploma I earned my undergraduate degree from Purdue University and my graduate degrees from American University. I\'ve gone into many types of fields for which I had zero qualifications and managed to learn the system until I could alter it to suit my needs. It\'s been a fun ride as I\'ve climbed the corporate ladder in a few different companies worked as a public speaker for Citizens Against Crime and as a Criminalist at the US ATTY\'s Office managed HR for Prudential in Indiana and co-written and/or written over 50 books as a ghostwriter. Those are the highlights. Meanwhile Amazon is my passion. I\'ve gone from $0 to $20k per month in sales at around 42% profit in about 7 months part-time. And that\'s what I will be talking about., No venue'|

By Monique Cuvelier Hellen Buttigieg is the embodiment of competence strutting around messy houses with a sassy bob and an open face. She locks her huge brown eyes with a client\xe2\x80\x99s and asks directly but respectfully \xe2\x80\x9cDo you really need this? Why? How does it make you feel when I take it away?\xe2\x80\x9d And very occasionally when a person seems unreasonably attached to a shopping bag of old birthday cards or an ugly ashtray pilfered from a restaurant in Greece she pulls out the tough love: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to give me trouble with this?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 As the host of the Discovery Home Channel\xe2\x80\x99s hit show\xc2\xa0Neat Buttigieg provides clutter control and guidance to a new household every week. She\xe2\x80\x99s something between an organizer and a headshrinker with certifications as a professional organizer and as a life coach. She simultaneously cleans out closets while slowly uncovering subconscious \xe2\x80\x9cblocks\xe2\x80\x9d that make a person want to hoard junk or prevent them from putting their dirty clothes in the hamper.\xc2\xa0 Her gentle leadership made a lifelong fan out of client Denise Fujiwara who says Buttigieg \xe2\x80\x9cis a living example of what you can do with an affirmative attitude.\xe2\x80\x9d The Toronto-based choreographer was lost trying to sort out her home office to make room for a house renovation when she called in Buttigieg to help. As someone who runs her own choreography business and dance troupe Fujiwara\xe2\x80\x99s office is prone to clutter. \xe2\x80\x9cMy office was a horrendous mess\xe2\x80\x9d she says. She describes stacks of boxes piles of unfiled papers photographs video tapes press releases \xe2\x80\x93 essentially 15 years\xe2\x80\x99 worth of disorder and confusion.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d tried to sort it out in the past but I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had the skills to do it properly until I worked with Hellen. In about 6 hours she did what I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do in 15 years\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\xc2\xa0 The two went around the room in an orderly way starting at the door and working clockwise. \xe2\x80\x9cOccasionally I\xe2\x80\x99d get stuck on something and she\xe2\x80\x99d push me to make a decision\xe2\x80\x9d says Fujiwara. \xe2\x80\x9cShe pushed through and in the end I felt euphoric to be relieved of all that stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Buttigieg unloads stuff with a dancer\xe2\x80\x99s grace and a politician\xe2\x80\x99s diplomacy. Anyone would think she was born taking charge of people\xe2\x80\x99s unruly environs teaching them how to be better organized. In a way that\xe2\x80\x99s true. She says she was always organized even as a teenager when most kids live among piles of laundry music collections and notebooks. She was also always a confident speaker. In grammar school she was the girl who narrated the school plays.\xc2\xa0 In fact Buttigieg moves and speaks so naturally in front of the camera and with such calm assertiveness no one would guess that not long ago she was at a loss for what to do with her life.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI had been out of the workforce for almost 10 years as a stay-at-home mom but I lacked confidence and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do\xe2\x80\x9d she says from her home in Oakville a suburb of Toronto Canada.\xc2\xa0 She graduated from Seneca College in Toronto with a degree in radio and television broadcasting and worked briefly as an administrator and fitness instructor. But then she had two children and took off nearly 10 years from work to raise them. Those 10 years at home had slowly whittled away her confidence as a businessperson but she still wanted to launch a new career \xe2\x80\x93 and have some adult conversation. Her solution? In 1999 she joined City Centre Toastmasters.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cToastmasters changed my life\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\xc2\xa0 She means that in the most literal sense. It started with one of the first lessons any new Toastmaster learns: talk about what you know. Buttigieg started writing speeches about what she knew and as someone who was naturally neat she talked about organizing. And then at one contest she gave a speech called \xe2\x80\x9cSimple Simon\xe2\x80\x9d about simplifying your life by letting go of clutter and it launched a new career.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cGiving speeches is a journey of self-discovery\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cHow often in life do people really listen to us? At Toastmasters people are truly listening; they\xe2\x80\x99re not thinking about what they\xe2\x80\x99ll say back. It\xe2\x80\x99s a safe place to speak so I could use my speeches to work out what resonated with the audience.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And also what resonated with her. That speech was the nugget that now sits at the center of her professional life. In fact she still uses parts of the same speech today when she gives presentations: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you would like to get a taste of the simple life don\xe2\x80\x99t let\xc2\xa0stuff\xc2\xa0complicate it. Commit to following these three simple steps: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t use it lose it; if you don\xe2\x80\x99t need it don\xe2\x80\x99t buy it; and when you bring one item in take one item out.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 This would become her mantra in several ways. It sparked her desire to become a life coach and also tapped into her abilities as an organizer. Starting her own organizing business called WeOrganizeU helped pay for the life-coaching certification. Soon a group of producers approached her about a new show that would blend her gifts for tidying up with her ability to lead people and by 2004\xc2\xa0Neat\xc2\xa0hit the North American airwaves.\xc2\xa0 Buttigieg credits Toastmasters with more than just sparking a good idea; she also says she honed her skills as a leader and built confidence. Shalini Alleluia president of City Centre Toastmasters says Buttigieg faced a short learning curve thanks to her take-charge attitude.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cHellen had lots of energy and was articulate and vibrant\xe2\x80\x9d Alleluia says. \xe2\x80\x9cShe always smiled and was willing to try anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Alleluia says even though Buttigieg was a new member she asked her to chair a speech contest and encouraged her to assume meeting roles. Soon Buttigieg was helping others to be better speakers.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI think Hellen was more of a mentor to other people than other people being a mentor to her\xe2\x80\x9d Alleluia says. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has a charisma that makes people want to follow her and to be like her in personality and capability. She\xe2\x80\x99s a good listener and she always pays attention to the evaluation notes. I once told her she was very loud and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have expression in her delivery and she really listened.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Like any good Toastmaster Buttigieg is still seeking advice on how to improve. She still asks Alleluia for feedback on her presentations and episodes of the TV show. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m honest and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell her what I thought the show lacked or what I learned\xe2\x80\x9d says Alleluia.\xc2\xa0 While Alleluia coaches Buttigieg to improve some public speaking skills her student is working toward a broader purpose. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a teacher\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel that whether I\xe2\x80\x99m organizing or coaching or speaking there\xe2\x80\x99s still that element of wanting to pass on the information I know to improve other people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead The\xc2\xa0Toastmaster\xc2\xa0on Your iPad! http://www.toastmasters.org/iPadMag Access the Toastmasters International iPad\xc2\xae app by following these steps: 1.

By Monique Cuvelier Hellen Buttigieg is the embodiment of competence strutting around messy houses with a sassy bob and an open face. She locks her huge brown eyes with a client\xe2\x80\x99s and asks directly but respectfully \xe2\x80\x9cDo you really need this? Why? How does it make you feel when I take it away?\xe2\x80\x9d And very occasionally when a person seems unreasonably attached to a shopping bag of old birthday cards or an ugly ashtray pilfered from a restaurant in Greece she pulls out the tough love: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to give me trouble with this?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 As the host of the Discovery Home Channel\xe2\x80\x99s hit show\xc2\xa0Neat Buttigieg provides clutter control and guidance to a new household every week. She\xe2\x80\x99s something between an organizer and a headshrinker with certifications as a professional organizer and as a life coach. She simultaneously cleans out closets while slowly uncovering subconscious \xe2\x80\x9cblocks\xe2\x80\x9d that make a person want to hoard junk or prevent them from putting their dirty clothes in the hamper.\xc2\xa0 Her gentle leadership made a lifelong fan out of client Denise Fujiwara who says Buttigieg \xe2\x80\x9cis a living example of what you can do with an affirmative attitude.\xe2\x80\x9d The Toronto-based choreographer was lost trying to sort out her home office to make room for a house renovation when she called in Buttigieg to help. As someone who runs her own choreography business and dance troupe Fujiwara\xe2\x80\x99s office is prone to clutter. \xe2\x80\x9cMy office was a horrendous mess\xe2\x80\x9d she says.

|b"18676782, 2, Sisterhood of Beautiful Brown Ladies, This group was created for women in their mid to late 20's to 30's looking for friendship and fun. As I get older I realize how difficult it can be to establish and maintain friendships with like-minded women and I'm sure others have experienced the same. So if you are new to the area or just looking to make genuine connections and have fun while doing it this is the group for you! Although the group is based in Laurel it is open to anyone in the DC/Baltimore metro area. We will try to have events outside of Laurel so that we can cater to everyone in the group. Also if you want to organize your own meetup please by all means feel free! I look forward to having some fun! -Jamie\nFYI - If a group member 'no-shows' for two events then they will be removed from the group.&nbsp;,Laurel, language, -76.8799972534, 39.0999984741, Dining Out; New In Town; Travel; Black Professionals; Nightlife; Women's Social; Fine Arts; Girls' Night Out; Brunch; Black Women; African American Women; Sisterhood; Afterwork Happy Hours and Dinner; ,18676782, 223473017, Summer Spirit Festival, 2015-08-08 18:00:00, I was thinking about going to the Summer Spirit Festival if anyone else is interested.

Sound tools entrain the brain to move into the deeper Alpha and Theta brain wave frequencies. These are the frequencies that induce deep meditative and peaceful states clarity of mind and intuition. Sound frequency impacts the sympathetic nervous system as your brain waves synchronize to the sound vibrations. The harmonic vibrations engage the relaxation reflex and slow down the respiratory brain and heart rate and disrupt the pain reflex. Modern medicine can now measure and confirm the practice of sound as a means to promote healing. Thus sound is a type of energy medicine that creates the sacred space in which people can heal the body mind and spirit. I will be using many types of sound healing from ancient drumming to newer technologies of Crystal singing bowls. (maybe even some voice) You will either sit comfortably or lie on the floor and just be. All you need do is relax and listen and let your body feel the vibrations. You will feel rejuvenated and uplifted. See my webpage for a list of benefits of sound healing.http://www.rainbowreikihealing.com/Sound-Healing.html This is a donation based event. No one will be turned away if finances are an issue. All are welcome. , The Insight Center, Timonium, 2 Oakway Road, -76.625351, 39.439014'|

It can heal emotional and physical problems improve relationships and finances help you grow spiritually or just make life easier. It is the most advanced spiritual tool given to mankind to cleanse our karma without having to face or problems directly. As my mentor and teacher Liz Draman used to say "clear the trauma without the drama". It will literally clear the negativity around a specific situation illness etc. when invoked. It transmutes our karmic records into pure light. It has the power to transmute to change and raise energy that has slow vibration into energy of higher vibration. Decrees have a mystical power to them. They invoke the power and spirit of your innate divinity the power of God that resides within you. Decrees are spoken out loud and release the power of the Word through the throat chakra. Every time you speak a decree out loud you are drawing upon spirit so that God can act in your life in an expedient way. Benefits of the Violet Flame: Transform fear into courage Transform anxiety into peace Heal personal and planetary karma Clears karma at a cellular level Raises energy body to a higher vibration Spiritual accelleration Improves relationships Quickens the mind Accelerates personal growth Purifies negative energy Transforms families and communities Rejuvinates the physical body Transforms illness and more......

However as BronyCon is so big gathering everyone in one place can be a bit of tricky task to accomplish. As such to coordinate things with the Baltimore Bronies we'll be combining our efforts and doing both of our group photos at the same time. As most of the people in the Baltimore group are also in the DC group this shouldn't pose too much of a problem. We'll be meeting on the outside terrace (weather permitting) across from Hall of the Sun and Hall of the moon on the 300 level. In case of inclement weather we'll be meeting at the Indoor Terrace nearby. It's in between the two escalators going down to the 200 level near Hall of the Sun. The actual photo will be taken around 7:30 the start time is at 6:30 to give everyone time to get there and time for socialising., Baltimore Convention Center, Baltimore, 1 West Pratt St, -76.616136, 39.286138"|

|b'18710892, 2, Baltimore 20 Somethings Introverts, I created this group because I was dissatisfied with existing groups in the general Baltimore County area pertaining to social anxiety shyness and introversion. I am less interested in having a support group or therapy sessions and more interested in just having fun with some down-to-Earth good-natured people who don\'t have the most active social lives or are just plain bored. Anyone is welcome but just keep in mind that I myself am not exactly a socialite and am doing this as a way to get out of the house more. Don\'t expect large gatherings of dozens of people or rowdy nights out; I\'m more into just relaxing going to the movies or finding a place to hang out where we can do something simple.\nI\'ve also found that many meetup groups tend to have members of mixed ages and while there\'s nothing wrong with that I think it\'d be nice to have a group in the Baltimore area (I\'m in Dundalk or the 21224 zip code for reference) for shy people exclusively in their 20\'s so that we don\'t have to feel even more out of place or awkward than we already might. Also groups geared toward very specific "geeky" activities are fine but unless you\'re intimately familiar with whatever the hobby is there\'s a good chance that you\'ll stand out or feel insecure if you have anxiety and aren\'t a super expert at anything in particular.\nI don\'t want anyone to have to feel that way. I just want friends -- regardless of what their knowledge of advanced literature or geek culture is like and without anyone having to worry about not fitting in or being drowned out in a large crowd. Let\'s see if we can get a small group of friends going in a totally chill non-judgmental environment where there\'s less emphasis on constant meetups and more emphasis on just connecting as people on our time whenever we feel comfortable doing so. I\'m totally fine with Skyping or having casual phone conversations when we\'re unable to meet in person as well.\nOne other thing: Because I do have some anxiety issues that I\'m trying to overcome I\'m not too into traveling long distances for meetups or doing anything like going to clubs or concerts. I\'m just looking for something interesting and relaxing to do in Dundalk or the surrounding areas of Baltimore County even if it\'s just getting something to eat or seeing a movie or going to the mall and sitting around once in a while -- and again as I\'m more interested in genuine friendships than in "activity partners" I\'m totally fine with just talking on the phone once in a while or doing some online gaming or something like that. I really have no idea what this group should be so if you have any ideas definitely let me know. I read too many posts on sites like reddit about how people waste their 20\'s being lonely and I think that if you\'re in that boat let\'s forget what a conventional meetup is "supposed" to be and just try to be awesome friends.,Baltimore, socializing, -76.5400009155, 39.2799987793, Watching Movies; Social Networking; Video Games; New Technology; Reading; 20\'s & 30\'s Social; 20\'s Social; Gaming; Social Anxiety; Console Gaming; Geeks & Nerds; Movies in Movie Theaters; Anxiety; 20 somethings; Shyness; ,18710892, 224302935, Boards and Brews, 2015-08-25 22:00:00, I go to this pretty much every month so feel free to join me.

Here's our book for July. Hope you enjoy! The New York Times bestseller and the USA Today #1 Hot Fiction Pick for the summer The Chaperone is a captivating novel about the woman who chaperoned an irreverent Louise Brooks to New York City in 1922 and the summer that would change them both.\xc2\xa0 Only a few years before becoming a famous silent-film star and an icon of her generation a fifteen-year-old Louise Brooks leaves Wichita Kansas to study with the prestigious Denishawn School of Dancing in New York. Much to her annoyance she is accompanied by a thirty-six-year-old chaperone who is neither mother nor friend.\xc2\xa0 Cora Carlisle a complicated but traditional woman with her own reasons for making the trip has no idea what she\xe2\x80\x99s in for. Young Louise already stunningly beautiful and sporting her famous black bob with blunt bangs is known for her arrogance and her lack of respect for convention. Ultimately the five weeks they spend together will transform their lives forever. For Cora the city holds the promise of discovery that might answer the question at the core of her being and even as she does her best to watch over Louise in this strange and bustling place she embarks on a mission of her own. And while what she finds isn\xe2\x80\x99t what she anticipated she is liberated in a way she could not have imagined.\xc2\xa0 Over the course of Cora\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Louise her eyes are opened to the promise of the twentieth century and a new understanding of the possibilities for being fully alive. Drawing on the rich history of the 1920s\xe2\x80\x9930s and beyond\xe2\x80\x94from the orphan trains to Prohibition flappers and the onset of the Great Depression to the burgeoning movement for equal rights and new opportunities for women \xe2\x80\x94Laura Moriarty\xe2\x80\x99s The Chaperone illustrates how rapidly everything from fashion and hemlines to values and attitudes was changing at this time and what a vast difference it all made for Louise Brooks Cora Carlisle and others like them., Kate's House , Baltimore, Will send address to RSVP's, -76.61219, 39.290386"|

The Belmont house was built in 1738 and there is reported to be many different ghosts in the house and on the grounds as well as in the family cemetery. Pictures come off the walls knives move across tables and glasses break by themselves. There is supposedly a man who regularly appears in the bar area holding a beer. A daughter of a patron described in detail five ghosts that she saw including a young girl about 2 years old. She even said that one ghost had his hand on her parent\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder trying to get their attention. - See more at: http://www.strangeusa.com/ViewLocation.aspx?id=4678&amp;Description=_Belmont_Conference_Center__Elkridge__MD#sthash.7AC7db8B.dpuf Need a deposit put in by June 6 so we need half down by next meeting. They have heard a little girl a man a carriage coming up the drive and several other things. \xc2\xa0There is a cemetery in the back. \xc2\xa0A barn where the horses were buried and much more. This one is going to cost a little but I think it will be worth it. \xc2\xa0Remember we are the first paranormal group to go in here. \xc2\xa0$40 in person and $41 by paypal. You don't want to miss this one. History: In 1732 Caleb Dorsey of Annapolis and Hockley-in-the Hole on the Severn River had purchased the land in which Belmont now resides. Caleb Dorsey\xe2\x80\x99s son had several iron forges on the creeks that fed onto the Patapsco River. A bustling and prosperous port thrived then in Elkridge. One of Dorsey\xe2\x80\x99s sons also named Caleb was an avid foxhunter. Once while tracking a rare gray fox he found himself in unfamiliar territory near the home of Priscilla Hill. Their fortuitous meeting resulted in friendship then marriage. The elder Dorsey gave the land to his son as a wedding present and the younger Caleb built the manor house. On either side of the front door were placed two carved plaques \xe2\x80\x9cCPD 1738\xe2\x80\x9d. Caleb and Priscilla had three sons and six daughters. When Caleb died in 1772 his son Edward inherited the property along with the iron forges and several other tracts of land. After Edward died his headstrong daughter also named Priscilla gained ownership of Belmont. Priscilla eloped with Alexander Hanson in 1805. Hanson founded the Federal Republican a pro British newspaper and he poured money into the endeavor. Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s unpopular views resulted in his being attacked during the war of 1812 and he suffered permanent injuries. In 1815 Priscilla received her inheritance Edward Dorsey\xe2\x80\x99s property that she would name Belmont. After Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s death at the age of 33 Priscilla tried to run the farm but financial problems beset her and she sold parcels of land in the 1830\xe2\x80\x99s. In 1839 she mortgaged the estate for $1500. Realizing that her son Charles was addicted to horses and gaming Priscilla stated in her will that if Charles ever compromised the estate it was to be transferred to his wife and to her family. In 1875 the property went to a sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s auction where it brought $25. However because of Priscilla\xe2\x80\x99s foresight the auction was contested and the property reverted back to Charles\xe2\x80\x99 children in 1879. His daughters Anna Marie and Florence stayed on the property while other siblings moved away. In 1917 the property passed to Mary Bowdoin Bruce a descendant of Caleb and Priscilla Dorsey. Mary and her husband Howard restored the estate to its original beauty. Howard Bruce was the vice president and general manager of Bartlett Hayward Company a small steel factory. His prominence increased during World War I and he became well respected in the financial and political arenas. During World War II he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his vital contribution to the war production effort. Although Belmont remained a working farm Bruce\xe2\x80\x99s predominant interest was in raising and breeding his stable of thoroughbred horses. He became the owner of the famed Billy Barton who won numerous races including the Grand National Handicaps and the coveted Maryland Hunt Cup. Billy Barton is buried with full tack on in an upright position alongside another one of Bruce\xe2\x80\x99s horses near the time-worn barn. In 1961 after Howard Bruce\xe2\x80\x99s death the property passed to his cousin David Bruce the former ambassador to Britain who in turn gave Belmont to the Smithsonian Institute. The Smithsonian converted Belmont into a conference center where generals vice presidents astronauts and many other notables were able to meet in a quiet and controlled setting. In 1983 the 85 acre estate was sold to the American Chemical Society which continued the tradition of providing excellent hospitality to the world leaders. In 2004 Belmont was purchased by Howard Community College. The Community College added hospitality classes to the Belmont experience while continuing the same traditions as the two previous owners. On June 21 2012 Howard County Government purchased Belmont to ensure the stewardship of this beautiful site for the residents of Howard County. When fully operational Belmont will become a popular venue for executive retreats corporate trainings weddings company picnics and other special events. Environmental preservation and historical programs will also be major components of the management plan., Belmont Manor and Historic Park, Elkridge, 6555 Belmont Woods Road, -76.744385, 39.226421"|

"Oh yes this happened to me" before you might say. Of course this\xc2\xa0is\xc2\xa0something you\xc2\xa0would\xc2\xa0say especially if you have been touched by the paranormal before. Take the adventure now with\xc2\xa0Cat\xc2\xa0Gasch through her world of the paranormal as you never have before and you will be truly amazed. "Cathy E. Gasch was born raised went to school worked and still lives in the state of Maryland. She is currently semi-retired and lives in Washington County with her husband of thirty seven years and seven cats. She enjoys working in her yard and garden and enjoys making crafts. Most of Cathy\xe2\x80\x99s leisure time is spent reading and researching family history as well as historical\xc2\xa0locations. She loves to travel and has been to Ireland Scotland England and many wonderful and fascinating places in the United States. Cathy\xe2\x80\x99s paranormal experiences have spanned over 50 years and through them she continues to learn about herself and the world often times through the eyes of those who have passed on." Cat goes on to tell us about her life "amidst the paranormal"; "I have been able to \xe2\x80\x9csense\xe2\x80\x9d ghosts since I was around five years old when our family moved into an early 20th century home that was in need of repairs and renovation." "It was not until I was well into my teen years that I was able to share many of my experiences with family and friends. By that time I had done much research into the \xe2\x80\x9cparanormal\xe2\x80\x9d through library andstore\xc2\xa0bought books hoping to find answers to my experiences. What I learned was that I was not alone in what had happened to me but it still did not answer the question\xe2\x80\xa6why? Finally accepting my ability as a \xe2\x80\x9csensitive\xe2\x80\x9d shaped who I am my way of thinking and how I live and accept my life. I still don\xe2\x80\x99t have answers as to why I am able to know when those who have passed are around and I probably never will until I too have passed on. "Whatever the reason despite difficulties growing up and not being believed and whether or not people even believe me now I know what I am capable of am sure in what I do and am certain of my experiences. And this causes me to not fear what is beyond this life." "I wrote this book at the prompting of a fellow believer Mike Ricksecker who thought that I should share my experiences. During the process of writing each story I relived the experiences and learned new things about myself with a different perspective. The experiences are still fresh in my mind but putting them to paper allowed me to remember small details that would otherwise be lost to just myself. I can\xe2\x80\x99t thank Mike enough for believing in me and what I know in my heart and memory to be true\xe2\x80\xa6.I have and still live amidst the paranormal." Walk with Cat throughout her venture of the paranormal from being a very young child not knowing what she was seeing or why to growing up to trying to understand why she was given this gift of being able to "see feel hear sense" "them" at "their" convenience. Cat unfolds every tale of the spirits that have passed on from every\xc2\xa0location\xc2\xa0throughout her life since childhood both here and abroad. No matter where she goes even across the great oceans Cat continues to communicate with the undead and will\xc2\xa0continue\xc2\xa0to write about her tales. Won\'t you walk with her down this haunted path? Visit the websites listed below to learn more about Cat Gasch. Don\'t be afraid! http://www.ppmbeyond.com/ http://www.hauntedroadmedia.com/ Cathy E. Gasch has been able to sense the paranormal all of her life. Take a journey with her through haunted houses and ancient ruins across three different countries and discover for yourself what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to be sensitive to the paranormal. Mischievous ghosts spectral apparitions and forgotten souls abound in this collection of true spooky tales!\xc2\xa0 Check out this youtube video about her. https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=35&amp;v=LZTb00F8g3Q \n\n\n\n, Harry L Cooper VFW Post 160, Glen Burnie, 2597 Dorsey Road, -76.677727, 39.160839'|

Between mouthfuls of food and over the delicate scraping of cutlery the conversation remains a gentle hum of politeness - the banality of work the triviality of holidays. But the empty words hide a terrible conflict and with every forced smile and every new course the knives are being sharpened... Each couple has a fifteen-year-old son. Together the boys have committed a horrifying act caught on camera and their grainy images have been beamed into living rooms across the nation; despite a police manhunt the boys remain unidentified - by everyone except their parents. As the dinner reaches its culinary climax the conversation finally touches on their children and as civility and friendship disintegrate each couple shows just how far they are prepared to go to protect those they love.

Yule (from the Norse iul meaning wheel) marks the death and the rebirth of the Sun God; it also marks the vanquishing of the Holly King the god of the Waning Year by the Oak King the God of the Waxing Year. The Goddess who was Death-in-Life at Midsummer now shows her Life-in-Death aspect; for although at this season she is the leprous white lady Queen of the cold darkness yet this is her moment for giving birth to the Child of Promise the Son-Lover who will re-fertilize her and bring back light and warmth to her Kingdom. (_Eight Sabbats for Witches_ by the Farrars)\nModern Christmas celebrations are full of pagan symbology. Santa Claus is the Holly King the sleigh is the solar chariot the eight reindeer are the eight Sabbats their horns represent the Horned God the North Pole symbolizes the Land of Shadows and the dying solar year and the gifts are meant both to welcome the Oak King as the sun reborn and as a reminder of the gift of the Holly King who must depart for the Oak King to rule.\n&nbsp;\nBlessed be!&nbsp; See you at our Yule Celebration!\nLord Skye,Baltimore, religion-beliefs, -76.5599975586, 39.3499984741, Witches; Pagan; GLBTPagans; Shamanism; ,1286975, 219868152, August Esbat, 2015-08-29 23:00:00, , No venue"|

We\'ll gather at establishments featuring great beer lists go on local brewery tours and maybe even catch a beer festival or two. \nI started this group because I genuinely enjoy a tasty craft beer and I want to seek out where to get the best brews in the Annapolis vicinity while making new friends. \nAll levels of craft beer enthusiasts are welcome but beer snobs are not! You don\'t have to memorize fancy beer lingo know if "Shake Your Money Maker" is a song or a beer or be able to sing "99 Bottles of&nbsp;Beer" in tune. But you do have to be 21 and mind your Ps and Qs.&nbsp; \nA few notes about this meetup group are below.&nbsp; Any questions or comments you have about this group are always welcome.&nbsp; Thank you for taking the time to check out Annapolis Brew Crew. Cheers Courtney \nGenesis of Annapolis Brew Crew:&nbsp; Annapolis Brew Crew is version 2.0 of a \xe2\x80\x9cBrew Crew\xe2\x80\x9d group I had in San Diego.&nbsp; As San Diego is one of the hottest spots in the country for craft beer there were about 20 breweries including big ones like Stone within about seven miles of where I lived and worked.&nbsp; The intent of my San Diego Brew Crew was to visit a new brewery the first Thursday of each month after work.&nbsp; Overtime people wanted to join my crew but didn\xe2\x80\x99t like beer so we often deviated from the breweries and went to local bars that had spirits and wine.&nbsp; Basically Brew Crew evolved into a happy hour group.&nbsp; Now that I have moved cross country I am starting a new Brew Crew but do plan to keep this one focused on beer.&nbsp; \nLimited Membership: Initially Annapolis Brew Crew will be limited to 50 members but should this group continue to flourish I will pay additional dues to Meetup.com to expand our membership base.&nbsp; The reason for this is simply because Meetup has gotten expensive and charges the organizer based on the number of members it has.&nbsp; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind paying for additional members as long as they are actively engaged in Annapolis Brew Crew so I will monitor this situation closely as our meetup group matures.&nbsp; Members who have not recently been active on the Annapolis Brew Crew site may be removed; however if you are still interested in this Meetup please feel free to rejoin as we\xe2\x80\x99d love to see you at a future event.&nbsp;,Bowie, food-drink, -76.7399978638, 38.9900016785, Beer; Drinking; Happy Hour; Pubs and Bars; Brewery Events; Craft Beer; beer festivals; Micro Brewed Beer; Beer Tasting; Beer Lovers; Women who Like Beer; Beer Events; ,18371371, 224042519, Kegs and Corks Festival - TICKETED EVENT, 2015-08-15 16:00:00, THIS IS A TICKETED EVENT. \xc2\xa0PLEASE GO TO\xc2\xa0www.kegsandcorksfest.com TO PURCHASE TICKET(S).

In his talk he will endeavor to answer the following questions: What is Firebase what makes it different and why is it important? \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa0 What makes Firebase + AngularJS + Node.js an awesome stack? \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa0What does one need to know in order to use Firebase? \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa0 What are examples of what Firebase can be used to accomplish? \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa0 How well does Firebase perform in various example contexts? \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa0 Does Firebase work at both the MVP stage and at scale? The talk will focus on Implementing powerful realtime applications with Firebase AngularJS and a dash of Node.js Also included will be a discussion of adding Firebase to your full-stack workflow building a client-only app with ease using AngularFire integrating Firebase with Node.js to achieve autonomous functionality and transitioning from an MVP to an application at scale. We will also explore examples of applications currently using Firebase and live-code a full-stack app with Firebase AngularJS and a hint of Node.js. Sinan received his B.S. in computer science from Northwestern University in 2014 and has been building realtime applications with Firebase ever since. His background is in computer systems and interfaces with a focus on databases wireless sensor networks and human computer interaction.

|b'12446372, 1, Baltimore Gen X Travel Club (late 30s 40s early 50s), This group is for active Baltimore Gen X\'ers in their late 30s 40s and early 50s who like to travel. Since we as Gen X\'ers in our older/wiser age tend to be more selective about where and how we travel this group\xe2\x80\x99s focus is on non-touristy responsible travel (to local domestic and international destinations).\n\n\nNon-touristy just means high-quality trips to cool distinctive destinations (e.g. Iceland) with lots of character as opposed to the cheapest vacations to the same old touristy spots. Responsible simply means patronizing locally-owned hotels and restaurants so that we give back - the money you spend stays in the local community which is not the case with most mass tourism that only works with the huge international chains.\nBesides that as a guiding principle we go wherever we want to go! Near and far domestic and international beach and city mountains and lakes adventure and relaxation long weekends and weekend to weekends and anywhere in between or longer! This is our travel club and it\xe2\x80\x99s all about us! So if you like to travel to cool fun places and are looking for like-minded new friends to travel with then this is the group for you!\nHow do we decide where to go? Easy\xe2\x80\xa6 while I\xe2\x80\x99ll offer some trips for consideration we\xe2\x80\x99ll chat about locales of interest that you have... here online and at local meet-ups at different bars &amp; restaurants in the city. Fantastic way to get to know each other and the oh so many neighborhood spots in Baltimore. Always new places to check out &amp; many neighborhoods to keep up with\xe2\x80\xa6 so might as well check them out with new friends and do some travel planning at the same time! We also can do other types of quality local Baltimore outings (e.g. walks/hikes volunteering) to keep in touch continue our travel ideas and build lasting friendships with our fellow city and metro neighbors.\n[Note: This group is the Baltimore-based sister meetup group of the Washington DC Gen X Travel Club.]\n\n,Baltimore, outdoors-adventure, -76.6200027466, 39.2900009155, Singles; Travel; International Travel; Socializing for 40+; Weekend Adventures; Singles 30\'s-50\'s; Adventure Travel; 30\'s 40\'s and early 50\'s; ,12446372, 221275417, Deep Creek Lake Fun!!

Signing up and paying the deposit is required to confirm your reservation on the Deep Creek Lake weekend getaway meetup.** ------------------------------------------------------- ORIGINAL POST We are going to end the summer with a super festive fun visit to Deep Creek Lake - located on the tip of the panhandle of Maryland!\xc2\xa0 Deep Creek Lake the largest freshwater lake in Maryland extends 12 miles and has a surface of 3900 acres with 65 miles of shoreline. The four-season resort located in Garrett County Maryland offers a wide range of activities such as boating fishing camping swimming hiking bicycling and horseback riding in the summer. (Skiing snowboarding snowtubing and snowmobiling during the winter months.) A short 3-hour drive takes you from hustle bustle metro life to Deep Creek Lake - one of the best kept secrets for a relaxing local getaway escape!  The outdoor activities are pretty much limitless at Deep Creek but most folks of course opt for lake activities such as boating kayaking and swimming. Rent a pontoon boat ski boat or wave runner and tour around the lake... or better yet to a local bar (yes via boat!). The area has state parks with scenic hiking trails to some very cool waterfalls. Bring your bike and try out part of the bike course for the famous SavageMan Triathlon that Deep Creek hosts. Or take it down a notch and visit the local shops restaurants &amp; bars and even explore "downtown" - walk the streets and check out the stores and eateries. Or go into total relaxation mode and grab a chair and a drink and just relax lakeside or at an outdoor bar... and perhaps venture down the road to enjoy some summer treats at the fudgery popcorn poppery and the best ice cream ever at Lakeside Creamery. We have lakefront accommodations right on the water\'s edge! Wake up and walk out back and enjoy beautiful views of the lake and mountains. Go for a swim in this freshwater lake or grab one of the kayaks that are on the property for hourly rental. We will also have a pontoon boat for the group to go out on... info on how to reserve your spot coming soon.\xc2\xa0  Our small waterfront hotel is a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence Winner for the last two years in a row and is newly renovated. There are 20 guest rooms which have either 1 King bed 2 Queen beds or a 1 Queen bed. Rooms feature hardwood bamboo flooring and neutral finishes with fresh white linens and comforters; and the furniture within each room was designed and built by a local artisan from reclaimed barn wood.\xc2\xa0 All rooms equipped with a mini-fridge and microwave and have a covered balcony with clear lake and mountain views.  You can opt to stay 2 nights (Fri &amp; Sat) or just 1 night (Sat)...whatever works best for you. For now just RSVP and Save the Date - Aug 28-30! I know people tend to book up their summers early... so just wanted to get this on folk\'s calendars before other events &amp; trips get scheduled on this weekend. When the date gets closer I\'ll send out a message about pricing (based on single and double occupancy) and when a deposit is due to hold your spot. And we can start to coordinate rides and such. **Paying a deposit will be required to confirm your reservation on the Deep Creek Lake weekend getaway.** More to come... stay tuned. Hope you can join us for this fun lake vacation!\xc2\xa0 This is a combined meetup for the Washington DC Gen X Travel Club and Baltimore Gen X Travel Club., No venue'|

Here's a few changes. 1. Because of the low turnout I lost $60+ so to offset it slightly it'll be $6 until further notice. 2. To encourage no-shows to come and negate their impact when they don't I have discussed with other members and decided that reservations will be fully confirmed by paypal payments and slots can be taken by those who reserve and pay from the waiting list(of course this will require checking with me to see if all who reserved have payed yet.) I will postpone this change for now in hopes that maybe just maybe it won't really be necessary. 3. In honor of the original founder who I can only hope to be as gracious of a host as he was we are all about fun so no other changes.\xc2\xa0, No venue"|

The league advertises the season dates and builds a queue of committed players for the season. Kickoff Day - August 25th The start day of the season players are sent a kickoff email that contains important information about the league the link where your league standings and players contact information. We guarantee 6 playing partners at your playing level but have been averaging closer to 15+ partners in most cities. Your Task - "Flexible Scheduling" After this kickoff email is sent it is the player\'s task to communicate with other players. Players should work with their partners to find an agreeable time and location to play the match. While Tennis-Baltimore doesn\'t mandate your playing schedule it is recommended that players schedule at least one match per week. By request of the players we started to allow players to play 1 rematch per season. The regular season is all about playing as much as you can. As of Jan. 1st 2013 we\'ve had 189 players play more than 20 matches in a season. Where to Play?Play at your local free tennis courts tennis parks condo courts or tennis clubs. The league strongly suggests that players jointly try to pick a tennis court location convenient to both. We provide an extensive list of tennis courts&lt;/a&gt; including # of courts lighting hitting walls etc. We strive to keep this list up-to-date TennisBaltimore sets up a must play dates to push players out on the courts. The final deadline is the date marking the end of the season at which point players with 5 wins will qualify for a post-season playoff to determine the league champion. How to Play? Players can use three semi-standard playing formats: 2 out of 3 sets 2 sets with 10 point super tie-breaker or the 10-game pro set (First to 10 used when court time is limited). Playoffs Each season concludes with a playoffs where players with anywhere from 3 to 5 season wins qualifies for a single elimination tourney.

|b"2616692, 1, Carroll Rhythms Drum Circle, What is a drum circle? A drum circle is a rhythmical event in which people come together to play drums and other percussion instruments. Drum circles are gaining in popularity here in the United States and all over the world. They are a fun and accessible way to play music in a group setting.\n\n There are three types of drum circles:\n\n \n\n 1) Culturally specific drum circles in which the participants are expected to know and play certain rhythms from different parts of the world.\n\n \n\n 2) Non-facilitated drum circles in which the participants are encouraged to play whatever rhythms they choose often creating them on the spot and in which there is no leader or facilitator.\n\n \n\n 3) Facilitated drum circles in which the participants are encouraged to play whatever rhythms they choose often making them up on the spot and in which there is a trained drum circle facilitator who helps the group to achieve a higher level of musicality through gentle direction.\n\n \n\n Carroll Rhythms uses this third model in all of its community drum circles. We often sustain our rhythms for twenty minutes or more. In addition we play at a comfortable volume we vary the tempo and types of rhythms we play and we use a lot of different instruments. In the past we've incorporated all instruments that people have brought to our drum circles including:\n\n -djembes ashikos bougaraboos cajons congas bongos nadals talking drums riqs doumbeks djun djuns buffalo drums tars and bodhrans\n\n -trumpets saxophones harmonicas conch shells didgeridoos recorders penny whistles ocarinas and flutes\n\n -shakers rain sticks and ocean drums\n\n -mbiras berimbaus and jaw harps\n\n -guitars mandolins dulcimers harps violins and electric bass\n\n -glockenspiels singing bowls chimes tambourines hank drums and bells\n\n -pianos accordions and keyboards\n\n -rasps cabasas and washboards\n\n -tongue drums slit gongs cajitas clave and udu\n\n -Boomwhackers\n\n -Theremin\n\n \n\n We also encourage people to dance and sing!,Westminster, music, -76.9899978638, 39.5600013733, Drums; Drum Circle; Music; Hand Drumming; Dancing; djembe; Percussion; Improvisational Music and Art; Community Activities: Drum Circle Hafla Movies; Community Drum Circle; Rhythm; ,2616692, qpzsdcytlbtb, Drum Circle, 2015-08-15 23:00:00, 7:00 to 9:00 on the\xc2\xa0third Saturday of every month.

A devastating cholera outbreak seizes London just as it is emerging as a modern city: more than 2 million people packed into a ten-mile circumference a hub of travel and commerce teeming with people from all over the world continually pushing the limits of infrastructure that\'s outdated as soon as it\'s updated. Dr. John Snow\xe2\x80\x94whose ideas about contagion had been dismissed by the scientific community\xe2\x80\x94is spurred to intense action when the people in his neighborhood begin dying.With enthralling suspense Johnson chronicles Snow\'s day-by-day efforts as he risks his own life to prove how the epidemic is being spread. When he creates the map that traces the pattern of outbreak back to its source Dr. Snow didn\'t just solve the most pressing medical riddle of his time.

|b"1792728, 1, Silver Spring Krishnamurti Dialogue, Our dialogue is an attempt to explore together the nature of the self and the profound questions of existence Krishnamurti raised as they relate to our daily lives. Krishnamurti\xe2\x80\x99s teachings are often referenced as a point of departure but we are not attempting to promote any teacher or belief system. Inquiring together as a&nbsp;group creates a mirror in which we can see our conditioning reflected as we expose ourselves to one another and to ourselves. At times it may resemble cognitive therapy or meditating out loud but we use no techniques or practices and the aim is not problem solving or self improvement but self discovery. Ultimately many of the questions raised come down to \xe2\x80\x9cWho am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\nOur dialogue is a self-inquiry among friends. In contrast to debate and discussion dialogue is not a comparison of opinions or an attempt to convince another of a held conviction. We are questioning not to grasp an answer but to reveal and sweep away that which is not true. Avoiding quick responses and listening deeply both to the speaker and to one's own reactions may put our questions and opinions in a new light. Our group which has been meeting for much longer than it has been listed in Meetup has become safe enough to make ourselves quite vulnerable allowing for honest and open sharing of our personal humanity.\n  We&nbsp;begin with a reading on the topic followed by fifteen minutes&nbsp;of silence.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is helpful if possible to speak out of silence and if not to observe the busy mind.&nbsp;After the silent period&nbsp;we go around the circle and check in with a question observation or personal sharing related to the topic. People who don't want to speak just pass. After the go around the group is spontaneous. It is everyone's responsibility to facilitate the dialogue process giving room for the quiet ones to participate discouraging the talkers from dominating and listening closely to all participants including oneself without judgment. This is a serious inquiry in which there is much laughter and affection.\n  Unless otherwise announced we meet on the second Sunday of every month. The doors open at 9:30 AM and the dialogue goes from 10 AM to 12:30 PM. Coffee tea and light snacks are provided.
