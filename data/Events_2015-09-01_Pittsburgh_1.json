Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.<\/p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.<\/p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br\/>\u00a0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Jason,<\/p>",

Every month we suggest a topic - some are clear cut, like spooky tales for Halloween, or books adapted to the cinema; others are a little more open to interpretation. This is one of the latter. It is always the case that you choose the title and you share your thoughts with a fellowship of readers who share your interest in literature. At its simplest, you read a book and you come and share it with us. Show and Tell-style. Easy.<\/p> <p>BYOB: Long Distance Dedications is a chance to read a title of either your choosing or a person of your choice. Read a book with a friend or family member who lives afar from our Someplace Special. If you like and it is an option, invite your partner to share in the experience - via Skype or FaceTime.<\/p> <p>This can be a great opportunity to share your book club experience with someone you love - an out-of-state friend or a long-distance love affair, a sibling or parent across the country, a military spouse deployed abroad. Choose well, friend... we're reading for two.<\/p> <p>The title selection can be anything - classic or contemporary literature, non-fiction, biographies... so long as both you and your loved one share in the experience. And, if this little twist doesn't appeal to you... it's always cool to arrive stag, your friendly neighborhood book club is always your best Plus One.<\/p> <p><br\/>Cheers!<\/p> <p>Sean, Co-Organizer, N4B<\/p>",

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.<\/p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.<\/p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br\/>\u00a0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Jason,<\/p>",
