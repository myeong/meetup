I enjoy being around groups of people when they are interacting and enjoying one another\'s companionship. I sincerely believe that as Christians we ""belong to one another"".

At the Winter Solstice the two god themes of the year\'s cycle coincide -- even more dramatically than they do at the Summer Solstice. Yule (from the Norse iul meaning wheel) marks the death and the rebirth of the Sun God; it also marks the vanquishing of the Holly King the god of the Waning Year by the Oak King the God of the Waxing Year. The Goddess who was Death-in-Life at Midsummer now shows her Life-in-Death aspect; for although at this season she is the leprous white lady Queen of the cold darkness yet this is her moment for giving birth to the Child of Promise the Son-Lover who will re-fertilize her and bring back light and warmth to her Kingdom. (_Eight Sabbats for Witches_ by the Farrars) Modern Christmas celebrations are full of pagan symbology. Santa Claus is the Holly King the sleigh is the solar chariot the eight reindeer are the eight Sabbats their horns represent the Horned God the North Pole symbolizes the Land of Shadows and the dying solar year and the gifts are meant both to welcome the Oak King as the sun reborn and as a reminder of the gift of the Holly King who must depart for the Oak King to rule. Blessed be! See you at our Yule Celebration!

Just a reminder: These pickups work because we play respectfully. All of us have to get up and walk into work the next day. As a result we each have a responsibility to look out for the others even our opponents. If the desire to win exceeds the desire to play together these pickups will wither and die.

Enjoy a fun cardio class and watch your fitness level rise without needing the coordination of an aerobic or dance class. This class is taught in interval style and is suitable for all fitness levels. Burn 800-1500 calories in 1-hour!! Decreases the impact on your joints by 80%! ______________________________________Washington Post Article 2/24/12 Best for the trend-seeker looking to shed pounds: Kangoo Jumps at Laurel Community Center Its a Wednesday evening at the Laurel Community Center gymnasium and Im wondering just what Ive gotten myself into. On the wall next to the basketball court looms a rack of the strangest footwear I have ever seen. Kangoo Jumps look a lot like ski boots but they have an elliptical apparatus affixed to the soles that gives when you walk. This is where the jumps part comes in you can jump as high as three feet with minimal impact to your joints. Balancing on the boots also develops core muscles. Spring-loaded boots were originally invented to help athletes recovering from leg injuries and the Kangoo Jumps routine gained popularity in the late 90s. The class atmosphere is welcoming a friendly group of women in their 30s on up. Im not the only first-timer here either. A few of the women have brought their own Kangoo Jumps which you can buy online for about $200. They clearly mean business but theyre happy to engage us fresh-faced newbies. Instructor Denise Pullet insists that balancing on Kangoo Jumps is easy and that no one has ever fallen in her class. She helps get me outfitted and literally holds my hand to pull me up to standing. At first I feel awkward and off-balance. But as soon as we start jumping I almost forget that these ridiculous-looking things on my feet are even there. The class consists of two segments the first focuses on cardio and the second on strength. Lots of jumping in the first half definitely gets my heart pumping and Pullet is tough but a good motivator through a series of difficult leg lifts at the end (the shoes act as a weight). Upbeat hip-hop and Latin music also helps. And come spring Pullet takes classes outdoors for Kangoo Outdoor Bootcamp. The actual workout isnt much different than your average cardio routine and the choreography is simple and mostly easy to follow. So what does Kangoo Jumps have on other less bouncy workouts? Pullet says wearing Kangoo Jumps reduces 80 percent of the impact on your joints and helps burn as many as 1000 calories per hour-long class. Plus its always nice to have a little extra spring in your step.,Laurel, fitness,-76.81999969,39.09000015,open, Weight Loss; Fitness; Singles; Self-Improvement; Nutrition; Sports and Recreation; Social; Women's Fitness; Group Fitness Training; Adventure; Dancing; Fitness Boot Camp; Exercise; ,13,1.67E+11,1929,Prince Georges,0.698970004,2.40654018,0.832508913,0.691965103,0.316345442,0.631243769,0.199683273,0.9841697856,3,4.88,177,3,2,3, Baltimore Bridge Night, 2010-08-28 00:26:04,As of 1/1/2015 we\'re somewhat over-subscribed. Please feel free to join the group but it may be a little while until we are able to invite you to an evening of bridge. Thanks for the understanding. We\'re a group of bridge players who meet every other Monday night for dinner socializing and a few hands of bridge. We are non-competitive players so none of this cut-throat pounding on the table and hollering for the director duplicate-style playing. Just some friendly Chicago-style bridge. Like you played in your grandma\'s kitchen but a little more grown-up than that. We are always willing to teach new players the basics. Really little more than a knowledge of how many cards are in each suit is needed. But bridge is a pretty complicated game so expect to take a few weeks of practice to begin to get the hang of it. If you are interested please feel free to reach out for the location of the next game. We generally have at least 8 players though most don\'t RSVP through Meetup so don\'t hesitate to reach out even if you think we don\'t have enough players based on the RSVP.

Krishnamurtis teachings are often referenced as a point of departure but we are not attempting to promote any teacher or belief system. Inquiring together as a group creates a mirror in which we can see our conditioning reflected as we expose ourselves to one another and to ourselves. At times it may resemble cognitive therapy or meditating out loud but we use no techniques or practices and the aim is not problem solving or self improvement but self discovery. Ultimately many of the questions raised come down to Who am I? Our dialogue is a self-inquiry among friends. In contrast to debate and discussion dialogue is not a comparison of opinions or an attempt to convince another of a held conviction. We are questioning not to grasp an answer but to reveal and sweep away that which is not true. Avoiding quick responses and listening deeply both to the speaker and to one\'s own reactions may put our questions and opinions in a new light. Our group which has been meeting for much longer than it has been listed in Meetup has become safe enough to make ourselves quite vulnerable allowing for honest and open sharing of our personal humanity. We begin with a reading on the topic followed by fifteen minutes of silence. It is helpful if possible to speak out of silence and if not to observe the busy mind. After the silent period we go around the circle and check in with a question observation or personal sharing related to the topic. People who don\'t want to speak just pass. After the go around the group is spontaneous. It is everyone\'s responsibility to facilitate the dialogue process giving room for the quiet ones to participate discouraging the talkers from dominating and listening closely to all participants including oneself without judgment. This is a serious inquiry in which there is much laughter and affection. Unless otherwise announced we meet on the second Sunday of every month. The doors open at 9:30 AM and the dialogue goes from 10 AM to 12:30 PM. Coffee tea and light snacks are provided. There is no charge.,Silver Spring, new-age-spirituality,-76.98000336,39.06999969,approval, Consciousness; Spirituality; Self Exploration; Who am I; Nondogmatic spirituality; ,5,1.50E+11,1740,Montgomery,0.477121255,1.462397998,0.669006781,0.643452676,0.215939358,0.383592026,0.10781559,0.881797356,1,4.83,152,6,2,3, Association for India's development Johns Hopkins University, 2011-03-12 04:30:34,visit http://www.aidjhu.org\r \r Welcome to AID and let us begin with a short story. A man taking a walk on the beach comes across a young girl who is doing something strange. She is taking the starfish one by one from the beach and putting them back into the sea. The starfish were washed onto the shore and the rocks by the waves and were desperately trying to get back into the sea. He goes up to her and asks her &ldquo;Why are you doing that? There are ten thousand starfish lying on the beach how can you make a difference?&rdquo; She looks at him picks up yet another starfish and places it into the sea; and responds to him &ldquo;Well it made a difference to that fish!&rdquo;. That is the spirit behind A.I.D. The problems of India are humongous and it is easy to be overwhelmed by them. But the people who started the organizations believed that if they work with commitment they can certainly make a difference to a few villages and that is a beginning!

A drum circle is a rhythmical event in which people come together to play drums and other percussion instruments. Drum circles are gaining in popularity here in the United States and all over the world. They are a fun and accessible way to play music in a group setting. There are three types of drum circles: 1) Culturally specific drum circles in which the participants are expected to know and play certain rhythms from different parts of the world. 2) Non-facilitated drum circles in which the participants are encouraged to play whatever rhythms they choose often creating them on the spot and in which there is no leader or facilitator. 3) Facilitated drum circles in which the participants are encouraged to play whatever rhythms they choose often making them up on the spot and in which there is a trained drum circle facilitator who helps the group to achieve a higher level of musicality through gentle direction. Carroll Rhythms uses this third model in all of its community drum circles. We often sustain our rhythms for twenty minutes or more. In addition we play at a comfortable volume we vary the tempo and types of rhythms we play and we use a lot of different instruments. In the past we've incorporated all instruments that people have brought to our drum circles including: -djembes ashikos bougaraboos cajons congas bongos nadals talking drums riqs doumbeks djun djuns buffalo drums tars and bodhrans -trumpets saxophones harmonicas conch shells didgeridoos recorders penny whistles ocarinas and flutes -shakers rain sticks and ocean drums -mbiras berimbaus and jaw harps -guitars mandolins dulcimers harps violins and electric bass -glockenspiels singing bowls chimes tambourines hank drums and bells -pianos accordions and keyboards -rasps cabasas and washboards -tongue drums slit gongs cajitas clave and udu -Boomwhackers -Theremin We also encourage people to dance and sing!,Westminster, music,-76.98999786,39.56000137,open, Drums; Drum Circle; Music; Hand Drumming; Dancing; djembe; Percussion; Improvisational Music and Art; Community Activities: Drum Circle Hafla Movies; Community Drum Circle; Rhythm; ,11,1.31E+11,1520,Allegany,0,2.198657087,0.903089987,0.632457292,0,0.576715318,0.239340981,0.8582775772,35,4.94,1830,21.05714286,0,1, Chesapeake Kayak Adventures, 2011-11-07 23:49:44, Chesapeake Kayak Adventures More than a Meetup Group November 7 2013 marked Chesapeake Kayak Adventures (CKA) Second Anniversary on Meetup.com. As we enter our third year on Meetup weve grown to over 1150 members and held over 315 events. Weve been featured in the Baltimore Sun Howard Magazine and Maryland Public Televisionss Outdoors Maryland. Meetup.com has rated us as one of the Best Outdoor Recreation Meetups in the world and currently ranks CKA as the largest most active kayaking dedicated Meetup Group in the United States. If youre looking to get out and paddle we are one of the most active kayak clubs in the Baltimore/Washington area but we are so much more than a Meetup Group. During the prime kayaking season we offer several events every week and are constantly looking for ways to offer more. One of CKAs main goals is to make kayaking with the safety and camaraderie of a group accessible to everyone regardless of their skill level or the type of boat they own. Many of our paddles do require the proper skills and gear for safetys sake but we try to offer a lot that dont. Our Wednesday Night Paddlers are a great example of those that dont. If you dont have your own kayak that isnt a problem. CKA has a fleet of very high quality touring kayaks that members can rent at our events. Rental prices range from $25.00 for weeknight paddles to $55.00 for our premium weekend paddles and $95.00 for weekend long camping trips. All you have to do is answer yes to the rental question when you RSVP and show up to find your kayak paddle and PFD waiting for you. There simply isnt another outfitter anywhere that offers this kind of service. If you would like to learn to kayak or perhaps how to do a better job of it we offer premium kayak instruction at some of the most competitive prices you can find. Whether youre looking for an intro intermediate or a masters class we have an opportunity for you. Our instructors are certified by the American Canoe Association and if youd like to become a certified instructor we can even arrange a class for that. We paddle on flat-water lakes reservoirs and easier non-whitewater rivers in the Chesapeake Bay watershed which means Maryland and the surrounding states. When weather and water conditions allow we get out on the Chesapeake Bay itself and its tidal tributaries. You wont find our events on whitewater rivers or 3 foot white capped waves in the Bay but we have lots of members that appreciate growing their skills in more challenging waters. Our season usually runs from sometime in March or April through November or December depending on the weather. Over the winter when water temperatures get cold and dangerous some members switch to hikes to stay active as a group. Those members with cold water gear do still get out and paddle occasionally on warmer days. 2014 will be our Organizer Chucks 7th year organizing kayak trips in a venue like Meetup. He is an American Canoe Association (ACA) certified instructor who has been kayaking for 20 years. His experience includes 7 years as a kayak instructor and member of the management team for LL Beans Outdoor Discovery School. His passion for kayaking brings lots of joy to his life and he loves to share it with others. We Jokingly refer to him as Fearless Leader after a character from the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon show which some of you may remember. Many of our members met while paddling with a Yahoo Group known as The Wednesday Night Paddler. It was an opportunity for people to paddle with a group on Wednesday nights after work. We worked on our skills and staying in shape while paddling off the days stress. As everyone made new friends the Wednesday night paddles also become quite a social event. They still continue in that tradition. We charge an annual membership fee but it is TOTALLY voluntary. You dont have to pay anything to paddle with us if you have your own kayak and gear. Members who pay the voluntary annual dues do get some perks like reduced cost rentals and priority on the wait list.

Movement is both the medicine and the metaphor reaching across all languages cultures and age groups to transform suffering into art art into awareness and awareness into action. Wherever the 5Rhythms are practiced a community is born to dance to sweat to change to support and to provide a safe space for each of us to shatter the egos hold and awaken the juicy unpredictable fascinating edge-walking rock star part of ourselves that yearns to be free. Creativity. Connection. Community. The 5Rhythms of Flowing Staccato Chaos Lyrical and Stillness form The Wave a simple movement meditation practice that encourages us to find our own dance of embodied feeling and to discover ourselves at our most fluid and creative level bringing more of ourselves body heart mind &amp; soul- into movement on the dance floor &amp; out in the world. There are no steps to learn and it can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of age fitness ability or experience. There are currently two classes a month in Baltimore on the 2nd &amp; 4th Sundays 3.00 - 5.00 pm in Charles Village led by Richard Jerram. See also his new Website Dance Into Life which has details of other classes in DC and in Bethesda as well as more about the practice.

We enjoy activities such as biking kayaking group walks festivals concerts exploring cool places and sharing good eats &amp; drinks. Our one simple goal is to have FUN! We chose the name Second Half Rally because all of us share that life situation chronologically even though we dont feel like it. But you probably qualify if you have some gray hair you OUGHT to have some gray hair youve forgotten your real hair color or the Mens Hair Club has your number on speed dial. If youre basically a kid who wants to go outside and have fun playing with friends then you\'ll fit in with our group. Membership in Second Half Rally is FREE. If you don\'t like something just remember that you get what you pay for... ""Put me in coach! Im ready to play... TODAY! WHY SECOND HALF RALLY? Life is the ultimate participation sport and were all in the game whether we like it or not. During the first half of living in this world its common to make rookie mistakes sign a long-term contract with the wrong team be stuck on the sideline training young recruits or suffer game-changing injuries to body mind and spirit. To make up for missed opportunities and bone-headed plays most of us need to step up our game as we take the field for the second half of our lives. In short we need to stage a strong Second Half Rally! That means coming up with a better game plan getting off the bench and playing harder with a winning attitude. In this group you\'ll be playing with other winners who share the same gusto and adventuresome spirit! OUR GAME PLAN FOR ACTIVE FUN The Second Half Rally meetup group has a straightforward game plan that respects the intelligence maturity and independence of its members: 1. Our primary goal at every event is to HAVE FUN. Then we do something active to make it happen. Other groups tend to focus primarily on doing a specific activity like biking hiking or kayaking led by serious aficionados. Too often they never get around to having fun. Second Half Rally has its priorities straight. 2. We dont tell our members how to have fun. Each event starts with an interesting idea and then people figure out how to have the most fun. It always works out. 3. All of our activities are aimed at regular people who enjoy an active lifestyle for recreation. We pedal paddle and hike at a reasonable pace that works for anyone in decent shape. We dont run endurance races or competitions and we take reasonable rest breaks. You dont need to be an athlete or a hardbody to participate but you must be able to keep up with everyone else. This is not a group for couch potatoes. 4. Depending on the location our events start at 10:00 am or later to give people enough time to get there be relaxed and enjoy themselves. Beginning at a civilized time is part of having fun on a weekend. Unlike some outdoor activity groups we dont wake up the chickens when we leave home. 5. We always accompany our events with good food and drinks. Taking time for refreshments and socializing with other members is an important way to make friends with people who share our interests. 6. With this group theres no need to RSVP No unless you change your plans. Nobody expects you to show up at a specific event unless you RSVP Yes. 7. All members post a clear personal photo showing their face so we can recognize each other at meetups to help build a comfortable sense of community. 8. Our group is friendly and welcoming but we dont tolerate whiners jerks dorks or anyone else who spoils the fun for the rest of us. People who don\'t fit with the group are quickly removed from membership. We still boogie! Do you? If so then join up!

I\'m open to the discussions and questions about ASL that hearing students have that can be just too complicated to discuss in ASL especially for beginners. If it helps understand ASL better it\'s all good to me. - All levels are welcome but if you\'re more advanced please be willing to help. Try to adjust to your audience and help them out.

Address: Centennial High School 4300 Centennial Lane Ellicott City MD 21042 room 406 (note - we have a different location during the summer) Parking: (see parking map below) The easiest place to park is in the lot on the South side of Centennial High School (on the left side of the building if you are facing the building. To get there enter the bus loop (on the south side of the building) and make an immediate left onto a drive that passes through a gate. It looks as though this is an illegal turn but it is not. This parking lot is hidden from the road so it may not be easy to find. If you have trouble parking park in any lot enter the building and then follow the Columbia Insight Meditation Class signs to room 406. Suggestions: 1. There are plenty of chairs but if you prefer to sit on the floor which is not carpeted please bring a hard pillow or zafu since when meditating it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation it is highly recommended that you try the chair first then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable. 2. If you have any back issues please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you. 3. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room. 4. Please try not to wear any perfume to the class as it can be quite distracting to others. Also with respect to those who may be allergic we do not use incense. 5. The group is not recommended for those under age 13. 6. If you arrive late please enter the room as quietly as possible.,Ellicott City, new-age-spirituality,-76.87000275,39.27999878,open, Meditation; Self-Improvement; Spirituality; Wellness; Mindfulness; Buddhist Meditation; Stress Relief; Spiritual Growth; Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction; Transformation; Insight Meditation; Vipassana Meditation; Mindfulness Meditation; Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy; Buddhist; ,15,1.15E+11,1329,Howard,1.397940009,2.971275849,1.266701967,0.680335513,0.632690884,0.779375878,0.44364529,0.9583684512,6,4.63,520,25,1,2, Howard County Photographers, 2012-04-17 02:20:13,Pursue your Photographic Passion.

Join us at a variety of locations around Baltimore as we continue to Explore Report and Cooperate across the Inner Sea! About Pathfinder Society Organized Play In an organized play campaign your character exists in a common setting shared by thousands of other gamers from around the world. In each Pathfinder Society game your character experiences adventures in two different ways. The first is a short one-sitting adventure (or ""scenario"") that is a single episode in a continuing story and generally lasts four to five hours. The second is a longer multi-session adventure (or ""module"") that is a single adventure but can take anywhere from eight to twelve hours to play. You can take your character to any public Pathfinder Society event anywhere in the world and while the Game Master and your companions might change every time you play your character advances as normal. Over time campaigning in an organized play environment offers a uniquely immersive experience as your diverse companions add depth and character to the campaign world. It\'s also a great way to get in touch with other local gamers meet new people and play regularly without all the prep work and scheduling of a traditional campaign. Your local regional coordinator (also called a Venture-Captain or Venture-Lieutenant) can assist you in finding or setting up your own Pathfinder Society event. Alternatively some players prefer to keep their Pathfinder Society experience limited to a familiar group of friends using the Pathfinder Society character creation rules adventure scenarios and reward structure as the framework for a private campaign. Either approach is a valid way to experience the campaign and many players enjoy a combination of public and private adventuring. Because Organized Play takes place in a shared-world environment additional rules are required to ensure that all players at all tables share a similar experience no matter who is running the game. The Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play outlines these special rules ensuring a level playing field for all. Please read over the contents of this guide carefully. How do I get started? All Pathfinder Society players must register themselves and their characters online. When you register on the My Pathfinder Society page you\'ll receive an official Pathfinder Society Number. Keep your Pathfinder Society Number handy and bring it with you to every Pathfinder Society event you attend. Paizo uses this number to record the adventures your character has completed and the prestige she has gained. Each character you create has a unique number appended to your Pathfinder Society Number so if your number is 10222 the second character you create will be 102222. If you don\'t have time to create a new character or simply wish to try out a new character class you may choose to use one of several level-appropriate pregenerated characters available or from your local event coordinator. If you play a 1st-level pregenerated character you can apply the credit for her first adventure to a newly created character of your very own. Where can I play? Once you\'ve got a Pathfinder Society Number and have created your character you\'re ready to play your first Pathfinder Society scenario or module! The easiest way to find a local game is to join this Meetup and RSVP for one of the upcoming Meetups on this site with an advertised level range for a level 1 character. The level range will be listed at the end of the Meetup title in parenthesis such as (1-2)(1-5) or (1-7). What do I have to bring? At a minimum you\'ll need a character sheet with all of your character information and details as well as an inventory tracking sheet which you can Download Here. You\'ll also need to bring a copy of your Pathfinder Society Number (it\'s a good idea to write it somewhere on your character sheet) a set of 7 polyhedral dice a pencil a 1-inch scale miniature or token to represent your character on a combat grid and a copy of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook. Other players may be able to lend you dice or a miniature for the gaming session if you don\'t have any but eventually you\'ll want to get a set of your own. The only thing left needed is a desire to roleplay and have have fun!

Know how you can help others and how they can help you. 3. This time is not about selling deals. It is about meeting people and creating opportunities during your followup with a new connection you make at the event. 4. Have a followup plan in place. 5.

Maybe there was some uniquely shaped rock or a tree that attracted your attention? Perhaps you thought for a moment that you could detect something as if there was some kind of presence on the particular site that you could not really explain? Many people testify that they feel a strong affinity with nature all around us that their strongest spiritual experiences are when they are moving through the forest. This is not new of course. Humans have always had similar experiences since the origin of our species long long ago. Through the ages we have tried to understand and process these experiences tried to portray them and give them shape sought contact with the powers and the presence that we felt all around us. These experiences are the core of nature\'s religion. Those of us who closely identify with these experiences exert a natural spirituality and seek a community that share in these gifts. That is the foundation of our community. We seek a harmony with nature and the gods based on ancient traditions and practices. We use the term ""ancient"" but that does not mean that our religion is obsolete or outdated. We reaffirm the old traditions and ways developed by the people who have gone before us but develop them simultaneously adapting them to our time and in the modern conditions under which we live. When we use the word ""ancient"" we may also allude to that it is rooted in a mythical time when our ancient ancestors lived in true harmony with the earth. Our religion is polytheistic meaning that we recognize and turn to a variety of gods and powers. Among these gods and goddesses include Odin Freya Thor Sif and the others from the Norse mythology. Not all gods are Aesir - Freya is of the Vanir family moreover it is not just the gods and goddesses we turn but to nature spirits as the fey animal totems and so on. While we share a common religious foundation with the ""Asatru"" we understand that that this term is too narrow. We recognize and celebrate these powers in rituals that we call blot. The blot can be considered as a symbolic celebration where we invite gods goddesses and beings to participate we offer them gifts and forming a relationship with them. A blot can be very simple and intimate but it can also be a big ceremony with many participants. Our festivals are tied to the seasons and we are also ceremonies surrounding life\'s rites of passage such as weddings funerals naming of children house blessings and much more.",Greenbelt, religion-beliefs,-76.87999725,39,open, Pagan; Asatru; Shamanism; Runes; Spiritual Growth; Transformation; Norse Mythology; Earth-Based Spirituality; Shamanic Journeying; Shamanic Training and Classes; Pagan Families; Norse Paganism; Heathenry or Heathenism or Heathens; Anglo Saxon or Germanic or Norse Religion; seidth; ,15,91212326750,1055,Prince Georges,0.77815125,2.390935107,0.602059991,0.696356389,0.352181925,0.627150505,0.070199894,0.9946728742,4,4.75,186,3.75,2,3, The Violet Flame and MORE at The Insight Center..., 2013-01-18 23:50:39,"I am in the process of integrating this group into another group I have created called Pure Energy as I Am now teaching and facilitating group meditations on many different spiritual subjects not just the Violet Flame.

We\'ll also discuss some of the current topics and issues in whole-food plant-based nutrition. ""Whole-food plant-based"" means we focus on plant foods in their natural unprocessed state as much as possible because such foods are the healthiest one can find. However this does not exclude small additions of salt healthy oils and natural sweeteners. Some people may also choose occasional use of more processed foods such as bread pasta bottled salad dressings and sauces sweet snacks pre-packaged foods vegetarian meat substitutes etc. These foods are not essential for a healthy lifestyle but they do make it more appealing convenient and tasty. This Meetup is for vegetarians vegans and people who want to be; for those looking to prevent or treat chronic diseases such as heart disease cancer diabetes obesity reflux constipation and many others.

Nearly every Friday night (sometimes Saturday or Sunday afternoon) this group will meet to play indie RPGs which we\'re defining as anything that\'s not Dungeons &amp; Dragons or Pathfinder. Most sessions will be open on a first RSVP first play basis. There will be a mix of continuing campaigns and one-shot adventures with the goal to keep mixing up genres and systems as we go forward. New players are welcome to join any session that is open to RSVP. Our approach gives you the freedom to pop into a session when real life allows and to focus on having a fun time. You need to bring nothing except enthusiasm. This group is wonderfully nice and supportive; this is tabletop roleplaying as it should be. Since September 2013 we\'ve played Always/Never/Now Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Cinematic Unisystem) Call of Catthulu Call of Cthulu Cosmic Patrol Doctor Who: Adventures in Time and Space Dread Dungeon World Eclipse Phase Fate Fiasco Ganakagok Hillfolk Icons In Nomine King Arthur Pendragon Laundry Files Microscope The Mountain Witch Mouse Guard Newsies &amp; Bootblacks Primeval Rocket Age Shab-al-HIri Roach Star Trek (Last Unicorn Games) Star Wars (West End Games) Wicked Lies and Alibis Witchcraft and Yggdrasil. Our goal is to play at least 10 new RPGs every year. My wife (Michelle) and I (Kirk) host these sessions at our house and will provide vegetarian meals and snacks. We have three types of meetups: Private Session: This is where a member of the group has wrangled 4+ other players for me (Kirk) to run a RPG typically one I\'ve already run for the group at my house. I\'m aiming to do 1-2 of these every month. RPG Gala: This involves up to 4 GMs running different RPGs for a maximum of 24 people. These will alternate between Friday Saturday and Sunday sessions. We always need volunteers to GM and these events are only possible when we have enough GMs to make it work. LARP: We\'re going to try once every four months to run a LARP with politics intrigue and mystery. This will be a sci-fi fantasy setting that specific enough to frame the scenario but vague enough for you to make your character your own. Good Enough Gaming: These are tutorials and help sessions for people wanting to learn how to GM or merely pick up some tricks on how to improve their game. If you have any questions or concerns don\'t hesitate to message me! Frequently Asked Questions Q) What will be provided at the session? A) Some sessions will have snacks provided and some dinner they will be labelled. Food will be vegetarian and usually there will be sodas and some snack food; hot water and an assortment of tea bags will always be provided. We also have plenty of pens pencils paper notecards and dice. Q) What should I bring? A) A sense of fun and teamwork! No rules knowledge or prior experience is presumed. Contributions of snacks or sodas are always appreciated. Try to keep things PG-13 in tone when possible. Q) What should I not bring? A) No alcohol or pets please. Q) What\'s the parking situation? A) Parking is available in the driveway and along the street. The best location if not in the driveway is alongside the curb of the nearby park between our house and Tamarack Road. ,Silver Spring, games,-76.98000336,39.06999969,open, Sci-Fi/Fantasy; Games; Roleplaying Games (RPGs); Gaming; Fantasy RPG; roleplaying games; Roleplaying; Game Night; Traditional Role-Playing Games; Role-Playing Games; Tabletop Role-Playing; Indie Roleplaying Games; Tabletop Roleplaying and Board Games; ,13,74829571827,866,Montgomery,1.079181246,2.021189299,0.920818754,0.691965103,0.488424491,0.530164907,0.249302323,0.9849726402,1,4.42,47,3,2,3, Maryland Hypnosis, 2013-08-08 22:25:59,"This meetup group is open to all who are interested in learning more about hypnosis and the possibilities of positive change.

It is for those who are tired of taking refuge in their beliefs and are serious about discovering the deepest intimacy with life that only comes from slowing way down and becoming deeply honest with oneself. Similarly this group is designed for people who see relationship as a vehicle for awakening. This group focuses on the profound impact vulnerability has in our lives. We consider the defining moments of any relationship: when we shield our hearts away from or open fully in the midst of the difficult moments that arise in everyday life. When relationship is used as a spiritual practice it will act as a furnace that stokes the fire that burns within. It will support your awakening flushing everything out that\'s not true - all of the conditioned beliefs and defense strategies - and inviting the deepest part of you to come forth in this world. Chris and Jennifer Rubacky are the teachers of this group. They have been in a conscious partnership for over a decade and married since 2005. They have devoted themselves to using their relationship as a crucible for embodying their essential nature in all aspects of their lives.  We begin with a silent meditation each week. All questions are welcome and everyone will have time to share. Suggested Donation: $20 dollars ($5-$20 dollars suggested sliding scale; no one turned away for lack of funds).

Since we as Gen X\'ers in our older/wiser age tend to be more selective about where and how we travel this groups focus is on non-touristy responsible travel (to local domestic and international destinations). Non-touristy just means high-quality trips to cool distinctive destinations (e.g. Iceland) with lots of character as opposed to the cheapest vacations to the same old touristy spots. Responsible simply means patronizing locally-owned hotels and restaurants so that we give back - the money you spend stays in the local community which is not the case with most mass tourism that only works with the huge international chains. Besides that as a guiding principle we go wherever we want to go! Near and far domestic and international beach and city mountains and lakes adventure and relaxation long weekends and weekend to weekends and anywhere in between or longer! This is our travel club and its all about us! So if you like to travel to cool fun places and are looking for like-minded new friends to travel with then this is the group for you! How do we decide where to go? Easy while Ill offer some trips for consideration well chat about locales of interest that you have... here online and at local meet-ups at different bars &amp; restaurants in the city. Fantastic way to get to know each other and the oh so many neighborhood spots in Baltimore. Always new places to check out &amp; many neighborhoods to keep up with so might as well check them out with new friends and do some travel planning at the same time! We also can do other types of quality local Baltimore outings (e.g. walks/hikes volunteering) to keep in touch continue our travel ideas and build lasting friendships with our fellow city and metro neighbors.

I look forward to meeting you all! Is there anything I need to sign? I know some clubs have liability forms and such. Please re-read meetup.coms terms of service especially section 6. You agreed to it in order to use this site. You may not have read it but you had to check the box that said you did. In general section 6 says if an organizer or any member places a event on the calendar and you get injured or something at it its your own fault. If you cant live with that this group isn't for you. Who runs this group? This meetup group is not an organization. It is a group of people who like to get together and socialize. There is no one in charge. If someone starts telling you what to do and you dont agree with it dont do it. Use your own common sense and leave the event if you think it is too risky or you feel uncomfortable. So who is this Chris who is the organizer? Isn't he in charge? Chris runs the web site. He can post calendar entries and moderate the message board as can any other organizers. (Moderate means if someone puts something up that is inappropriate he can delete it.) What are the rules? If you want a group that has rules you dont want this group. Ok well just a few basic ones. 1. Be safe and 2. Be courteous towards others. 3. Use a recent photo of yourself so people can recognize you when you attend any events. That means if someone does something you think is unsafe dont do it with them. If that doesn't work for you tell them about your concerns directly or whoever organized the event that you are uncomfortable or email the organizers. Nothing may get done about it so be prepared for that. No one forced you to go to an event and no one will force you to stay on one. You can leave at any time. Overall just have fun I assume that everyone who joined this group wants to have fun. If that is what you're looking for this group is for you! I am aware that not all groups are for everyone so please don't take any offense to the above statements. They are not intended to discourage anyone from joining.

It is also for people further along in their journey who want to offer support and in so doing experience benefits themselves. (Note that this description is subject to change based on input from the community). The format will change to meetings TWICE a month with telephone support for those who want it at least weekly. If you are reading this in late December 2014 dates for the first new meetings have not yet been set but will be soon. They will probably be on the 2nd and 4th or the 1st and 3rd Friday evenings of the week; stay tuned. We welcome peoples\' involvement as Participants Coaches or Helpers. Everything is free of charge with no commercial interests and nothing for sale.* PARTICIPANTS are those looking for help on their journey toward healthier food. Most participants will be beginners not very familiar with preparing healthy delicious plant-based foods or the benefits it can provide. Most participants will be omnivores interested in learning new recipes and trying to add something new to their diet. Some participants may be motivated by health challenges looking to reverse or radically improve health issues rather than just taking pills. Many participants will be from the Park Heights neighborhood. Participants will be open to the idea of possibly moving toward a plant-based diet. They are not required to bring food to meetings but may do so if they wish and may be able to receive a payment toward the cost of ingredients. This is also foreating together socializing and mutual support where people can talk honestly about their challenges barriers and successes. COACHES are those who would like to offer support to participants and should have some experience in preparing healthy plant-based food with minimal if any salt sugar or oil. Prospective coaches would attend support meetings and eventually determine if they would like to join the team by serving as a coach over a period of time. Coaches are not necessarily experts in plant-based cooking or nutrition but have some amount of passion for helping others to move in this direction and are able to provide helpful tips and pointers for participants. Some coaches will be motivated by the prospect of getting support and inspiration for themselves. If needed coaches may be able to receive a payment toward the cost of ingredients. HELPERS are those who are part-way on their journey able to prepare some healthy plant-based food with minimal if any salt sugar or oil who can give some advice and encouragement to others but are still on the path of learning. If needed helpers may be able to receive a payment toward the cost of ingredients. SUPPORT MEETINGS: Twice a month. We hope that most people will be regular Participants learning more over time with a smaller number of Coaches and Helpers. Coaches helpers (and Participants if they want) bring potluck dishes to share. There is usually a presentation about nutrition or food preparation often a guest speaker or excerpt from a video plenty of discussion about barriers and successes with sharing of ideas and recipes. *Useful kitchen items and copies of DVDs will be available at every meeting for sale at cost (no profit will be made). ""TICKETS"": Space is limited. An invitation (""ticket"") is required. We\'ll have a list of invitees so there is no need to bring a paper ticket. Send a request to attend by email WITH YOUR PHONE NUMBER and contact information and we will get back with you with the exact time and date. Some invitations (""tickets"") that are good for one or two months at a time. FREE CONSULTATION from Joseph A. Adams M.D. can be provided individually at support meetings free of charge for participants. This is not medical advice just coaching and nutrition information. INTRODUCTORY MEETINGS: To be scheduled periodically date location and frequency to be determined. These will be open to the public scheduled in or around the Park Heights area. All are welcome free of charge. These are outreach meetings to inform neighbors about the Nutrition As Medicine program. DRAMATIC HEALTH BENEFITS: For people who want to lose weight or treat and prevent heart disease high blood pressure diabetes cancer and many many other health challenges. Its also for anyone who wants to try fabulous new plant-based recipes that are more delicious and easy to prepare than they ever imagined. Its for people who like to taste a new recipe before they go to the trouble of preparing it themselves. Dr. Joe maintains a website of favorite recipes (www.NutritionAsMedicine.org) and can answer questions about nutrition health and medication. Just as people need support from N.A. or A.A. to overcome dependence on drugs or alcohol people also need support to get into recovery from chicken wings pizza and the S.A.D. (Standard American Diet). It is possible to experience a transformation and your taste buds will change as you learn to appreciate the taste of real food. Once people discover that healthy food is fabulous many can completely get off some or all of their pills for diabetes high blood pressure and other health conditions.

Also be active in community and do some things like stream cleanups etc (not mandatory) so this primarily an informal lacrosse toss around but if you're interested in doing some good you can.

There is plenty of free parking in the lot at the back of the building. Our group hosts an annual gathering and occasional field trips as well. We say Friends of IONS because our group follows the work of the nationally based Institute of Noetic Sciences (www.Noetic.org) founded by astronaut Edgar Mitchell. Please visit their website to learn more. The mission of the national organization is: Broadening our knowledge of the nature and potentials of mind and consciousness and applying that knowledge to enhancing human well-being and the quality of life on the planet. Given the wide range of topics and opinions that are presented and discussed during our activities it may not surprise you that IONS notes that Views expressed by speakers workshop leaders and participants do not necessarily reflect the views of IONS or anyone associated with The Institute of Noetic Sciences which in other words means that we foster diverse and open-minded conversations enough that someone is bound to take an opposing view or even not like what is said! And unfortunately in a litigious society we also must share that Baltimore Friends of IONS is wholly independent of the Institute of Noetic Sciences and is legally and financially responsible for its own activities.

Without all of her hard work to get this group up and running I wouldnt have had the opportunity to step in for her when her work got too busy. Im going to start this off slowly as I get my organizer feet under me. Initially Ill schedule a number of happy hours to get more acquainted with you the members. Beer festivals and brewery tours will be added shortly after. I hope that with your participation we can make this a fun and possibly even an educational meetup group. Welcome fellow ABCers! - Gregg &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; More About this Meetup From the original organizer Courtney: This is a group for fun people in the Annapolis area who appreciate craft beer. We\'ll gather at establishments featuring great beer lists go on local brewery tours and maybe even catch a beer festival or two. I started this group because I genuinely enjoy a tasty craft beer and I want to seek out where to get the best brews in the Annapolis vicinity while making new friends. All levels of craft beer enthusiasts are welcome but beer snobs are not! You don\'t have to memorize fancy beer lingo know if ""Shake Your Money Maker"" is a song or a beer or be able to sing ""99 Bottles of Beer"" in tune. But you do have to be 21 and mind your Ps and Qs. A few notes about this meetup group are below. Any questions or comments you have about this group are always welcome. Thank you for taking the time to check out Annapolis Brew Crew. Cheers Courtney Genesis of Annapolis Brew Crew: Annapolis Brew Crew is version 2.0 of a Brew Crew group I had in San Diego. As San Diego is one of the hottest spots in the country for craft beer there were about 20 breweries including big ones like Stone within about seven miles of where I lived and worked. The intent of my San Diego Brew Crew was to visit a new brewery the first Thursday of each month after work. Overtime people wanted to join my crew but didnt like beer so we often deviated from the breweries and went to local bars that had spirits and wine. Basically Brew Crew evolved into a happy hour group. Now that I have moved cross country I am starting a new Brew Crew but do plan to keep this one focused on beer. Limited Membership: Initially Annapolis Brew Crew will be limited to 50 members but should this group continue to flourish I will pay additional dues to Meetup.com to expand our membership base. The reason for this is simply because Meetup has gotten expensive and charges the organizer based on the number of members it has. I dont mind paying for additional members as long as they are actively engaged in Annapolis Brew Crew so I will monitor this situation closely as our meetup group matures. Members who have not recently been active on the Annapolis Brew Crew site may be removed; however if you are still interested in this Meetup please feel free to rejoin as wed love to see you at a future event.

Women\'s Book Club"" - in Annapolis", 2015-02-24 15:40:08,"I love reading books that give me a sense of empowerment make me feel inspired and give me the keys to ALLOWING a happier life. And then I want to chew on those concepts with others and hear about all the increased joy theyre feeling! Some self helps books use terminology that is not a perfect match to how would describe something but their intentions are all quite the same anyway. I just take what I can get from them allowing them to clarify the beliefs I find to be most valuable. _______________________ The format for this book club could be that we choose one specific book to read and then discuss. But if folks would prefer just bringing in ANY book theyre currently reading and discussing any way in which it makes them FEEL BETTER - thats fine too. Im going to host the first few meetings at my house until another member of the group feels comfortable hosting at hers - so we can be most comfortable and hear each other (which is often hard in a public place). _________________ If youd like to read a book in common for our first meeting may I suggest: ""How to Rule the World From Your Couch"" - this is basically about using the massive leverage of intuition before you take physical action. Great stuff. You know how science says we\'re only using 10% of our brains?

This group is for promoting health and wellness through an ancient practice called QiGong. What is Qigong? Qigong focuses on improving physical health and wellness. It opens the energy flow within the body by eliminating blockages. The intent is to balance the body by opening the energetic pathways (meridians). This is accomplished by a series of gentle movements synchronized with the breath. This form of Qigong can be safely practiced by the beginner with limited movement to the most advanced student. It benefits all students and aides them in moving forward no matter what their prior experiences. Each class is started with a set of Opening Moves to allow the body structure to open in all directions. Next we move through the Qigong movements. These movements focus on Energy passing through specific pathways (or meridians). The class ends with a closing Qigong form that integrates the mind-body-spirit to a more grounded state of well-being. Qigong is an excellent tool to acquire mind-body-spirit awareness. Its movements provide a path toward personal transformation. Each individual may have a different experience each time they practice the form. The goal is as they work toward balance of the Yin-Yang Qi they will notice improved health increased energy and a greater awareness of life. What are the benefits?

Sure we have differences and we may not see ""eye to eye"" but if we can accept one another ""as is"" we have already won the first battle of conformity and tradition. Let\'s agree to meet in order to walk/work together for the purpose of accomplishing God\'s Will. To create revolving strategies by translating the Living Word of God into creative action and imagery it is very important to ""Tell us about yourself"". Please communicate your talents gifts skills knowledge personality etc. that will best project your God given abilities and capacity to show God\'s love to others. To display these ""Actions/Acts"" of God\'s Love to others in the general public we aim to meetup once a month to actually do the hands on work which will be the result of putting some presentations in rotation and developing a good flow among members. Occasionally expect an extra meetup to strategize new actions afforded to us by the Holy Spirit the needs of the people and communities we serve. Even in our common interaction as a group in public we can represent The Love of God by also engaging in discipleship fellowship and showing others that Christians are fun loving and creative outside of our spiritual comfort zones and associates. We welcome all Believers in God and His Word who have a heart for God and who want to serve people with their talents time and resources. God\'s will be done!

We gather six times a week to study and practice: we recite traditional chants practice various meditation techniques discuss traditional texts and more. Please take a look at our ongoing calendar for upcoming meetups.ABOUT THE CENTERThe Gampopa Center was founded in 2009 in Annapolis Maryland by Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche based on the Buddhist understanding that the teachings of Buddha can bring us peace happiness and freedom. Lamas students were excited to welcome a qualified Tibetan Buddhist teacher into the community and wanted to provide a place for learning and practicing Dharma. As a growing community of lay Dharma practitioners we are grounded in but not limited to the Karma Kagy lineage. The Center consists of a small shrine room and we are actively looking to enlarge our facility.ABOUT OUR MAIN TEACHEROur community is grateful for the opportunity to learn and practice under the direction of an authentic accomplished guide Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche. Born in Tibet in 1973 he is a monk scholar and author. The Dalai Lama and the Seventeenth Gyalwang Karmapa have glowingly endorsed his book The Lamp of Reasoning and Scriptures of the Sage the Buddha. He has completed a traditional three-year retreat under the guidance of the Very Venerable Bokar Rinpoche who subsequently appointed Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche to be a three-year-retreat teacher. He has received advanced Buddhist training from masters in India Sikkim and Nepal. Now a citizen of the United States Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche makes his home in Annapolis Maryland.______________________________________The Gampopa Center has an open door policy.

Older Women Cheap Travel offer tours that cost one-third of what most companies charge and all of us women (10 per trip) share rooms which keeps the cost low.

We see the sites but we also enjoy the culture by going where the locals go and not just to tourist venues. I Pat Brown will be your guide.

Find out more about the trips and how we travel at: http://www.olderwomencheaptravel.com When we meet we will enjoy international food at a variety of restaurants and we will talk about our experiences as women travelers and share tips and stories and our wish list of places to go.

I am less interested in having a support group or therapy sessions and more interested in just having fun with some down-to-Earth good-natured people who don\'t have the most active social lives or are just plain bored. Anyone is welcome but just keep in mind that I myself am not exactly a socialite and am doing this as a way to get out of the house more. Don\'t expect large gatherings of dozens of people or rowdy nights out; I\'m more into just relaxing going to the movies or finding a place to hang out where we can do something simple. I\'ve also found that many meetup groups tend to have members of mixed ages and while there\'s nothing wrong with that I think it\'d be nice to have a group in the Baltimore area (I\'m in Dundalk or the 21224 zip code for reference) for shy people exclusively in their 20\'s so that we don\'t have to feel even more out of place or awkward than we already might. Also groups geared toward very specific ""geeky"" activities are fine but unless you\'re intimately familiar with whatever the hobby is there\'s a good chance that you\'ll stand out or feel insecure if you have anxiety and aren\'t a super expert at anything in particular. I don\'t want anyone to have to feel that way. I just want friends -- regardless of what their knowledge of advanced literature or geek culture is like and without anyone having to worry about not fitting in or being drowned out in a large crowd. Let\'s see if we can get a small group of friends going in a totally chill non-judgmental environment where there\'s less emphasis on constant meetups and more emphasis on just connecting as people on our time whenever we feel comfortable doing so. I\'m totally fine with Skyping or having casual phone conversations when we\'re unable to meet in person as well. One other thing: Because I do have some anxiety issues that I\'m trying to overcome I\'m not too into traveling long distances for meetups or doing anything like going to clubs or concerts. I\'m just looking for something interesting and relaxing to do in Dundalk or the surrounding areas of Baltimore County even if it\'s just getting something to eat or seeing a movie or going to the mall and sitting around once in a while -- and again as I\'m more interested in genuine friendships than in ""activity partners"" I\'m totally fine with just talking on the phone once in a while or doing some online gaming or something like that. I really have no idea what this group should be so if you have any ideas definitely let me know. I read too many posts on sites like reddit about how people waste their 20\'s being lonely and I think that if you\'re in that boat let\'s forget what a conventional meetup is ""supposed"" to be and just try to be awesome friends.",Baltimore, socializing,-76.54000092,39.27999878,open, Watching Movies; Social Networking; Video Games; New Technology; Reading; 20\'s & 30\'s Social; 20\'s Social; Gaming; Social Anxiety; Console Gaming; Geeks & Nerds; Movies in Movie Theaters; Anxiety; 20 somethings; Shyness; ,15,13794641966,159,Baltimore City,0.77815125,2.113943352,1.041392685,0,0.352181925,0.554494614,0.317049744,018719110,3,5,49,6,2,3, HoCo Girlfriends in our 20s!, 2015-07-04 23:45:36,New to the area and looking for a fun group of girlfriends?

All are welcome whether you are a therapist yourself or just curious to learn and experience Past Life Regression Hypnosis. Our meetings include discussions sharing own experiences - both - as facilitators/therapists and clients social outings field trips group meditations and hypnosis. Past Life Regression Therapy is based on the theory of reincarnation. It is belief that a soul survives death to be re-born again into a new body with renewed opportunity to learn life\'s lessons.This powerful tool is used by even most skeptical conservative and scientifically inclined therapists because it works regardless of our beliefs.If there are no physiological or psychological reasons for your issue then past-life exploration would be a wonderful way to uncover memory of a past trauma. Often Past Life Regression can reveal the root cause of a present symptom. Often just the matter of uncovering those memories is enough for the symptoms to disappear on it\'s own. Some people seek this kind of therapy with hopes to improve their health. Some people desire this experience out of pure curiosity. The outcome is the same - their life change in a very positive way. People are freeing them-self from pains fears physical conditions gaining more understanding of who they are improving their lives and their relationships. ,Sykesville, health-wellbeing,-76.97000122,39.34000015,approval, Metaphysics; Meditation; Hypnosis; Consciousness; Reincarnation; Spirituality; Wellness; Holistic Health; Energy Healing; Alternative Medicine; Spiritual Growth; Past Life Regression; Healthy Living; Hypnotherapy; Healing with past life regression and hypnotherapy; ,15,10893401973,126,Garrett,0.301029996,1.544068044,0.77815125,0,0.136242566,0.40501436,0.169141087,018799074,14,4.92,129,10.07142857,0,1, Odenton Volleyball Meetup - COED, 2015-08-03 22:46:22,I want to start a Volleyball meetup in the Odenton area for people that love the sport or just want to have fun while exercising.

Are you in a big church where you feel like you don\'t know other members or are young adults activities being organized for people under 25 and somehow you don\'t fit the full women or men\'s ministry range? Or you just don\'t see people in your age range in church! Are you Christian and looking to socialize with others but not into meetups for young people that seem to be always centered around happy hours? Are you looking for activity partners or just looking to expand your social circle of Christian friends? I\'m hoping to create a meetup where young Christians can socialize together. My goal is to create an active meetup where members can engage in activities such as dinners concerts/shows faith and book discussions museums dance activities mini golf bowling day trips whatever even taking a sushi-making class (it\'s more fun than it sounds). I\'m also very open to suggestions. If you have an interest in something else let me know. I\'ll usually try something at least once. So to complete Bunyan\'s Pilgrim Progress Reference at the beginning Christian and hopeful said to themselves ...""To prevent drowsiness in this place let us fall into good discourse."" In the words of Spurgeon ""Christians who isolate themselves and walk alone are very liable to grow drowsy. Hold Christian company and you will be kept wakeful by it and refreshed and encouraged to make quicker progress in the road to heaven"". I\'ve lived in multiple places growing up learned several languages and I enjoy doing multiple activities. I\'m a health professional who\'s got a bit of me in the financial sector. So I\'m hoping to create a meetup where we can meet people from various backgrounds professions etc. and hopefully make lasting friendships and have fun.

You may join so long as you\'re willing to drive to the meetup location which will initially and maybe even primarily be in Baltimore or Howard county. Depending on feedback from the majority of the members we may also have meetups planned elsewhere such as in Montgomery or Anne Arundel county. However for now as your organizer lives in Baltimore County we will have them in this area to start with. :) The main reason this group exists is because I am looking for like-minded people to hang out with and make friends who ""get"" this stuff! What we\'ll do at our meetups is yet unknown until we get momentum going (don\'t you all just love the whole momentum thing?) and so initially we will just get together and discuss how we use the teachings in our day to day lives and perhaps share our successes all the while keeping it positive! I am very open to any kind of feedback and suggestions so shoot me a message whenever. If you\'re not too familiar with the teachings but are very interested in knowing more about them you can read about Abraham here: http://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/about_...

Members include women who are interested in running for elected office women who are serving on campaigns women who are running for office women who are interested in Baltimore city politics as well as those who are dedicated to promoting the election of women to public offices. The groups objectives are to: Enhance the skills and sharpen the techniques of women who are interested in running for public office. Galvanize the collective support of women throughout the city to increase the number of women elected to public office. Promote the issues of concern to women especially those who are voiceless. - Educate ourselves in the issues of concern to Baltimore residents We must encourage women of all ages to run for office or be part of the process. Just being silent and ignoring the political system in Baltimore is not acceptable. This group we will empower women to run for city/county office and/or working on campaigns. Men outnumber women in these roles by significant margins. Fact: In the 110th Congress we had a record number of women chairing committees but that record is still only six chairs out of roughly 40 committees. As the pipeline to political power begins early in life 12 of the last 19 Presidents started their political careers before they were 35 years old women often handicap themselves by not considering a run for office until much later in life than their male counterparts. Join this meet up and let's start empowering each other to take a stand.
