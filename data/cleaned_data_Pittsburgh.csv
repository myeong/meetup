This is a donation based event we\'re going to bring you once or twice a month. Basically I will be available in the shop during an hour to an hour and a half one evening a month in order to take questions and have an open discussion on a pre-chosen topic for that time period. We wanted to do something different and maybe a little new age-y and talk about rocks and such. I\'m going to bring my stones and show you how they are used in my practice for mediation journeying and healing work including the stones I used in my successful recovery from several feminine disorders. I will also share with you how some of these rocks were used in ancient medicine and healing practices and how some are used today. A friend of mine Dan happens to be a rock person and is going to bring some of his favorites to talk about too. Joyce has many varieties of some of these stones in shop for sale if you would like to take them home (and she\'s incredibly reasonable so I often buy stones here). This is going to be as interactive as you want it to be; you will have the ability to work with these stones if you choose to but nothing will be forced on you in the least. If we can answer your questions we will. If we don\'t know the answer I\'ll point you in the direction you need to go either towards a practitioner or towards a book. This event is being offered without charge in the interest of building a healthy community but if you\'d like to support my work and the shop donations are happily accepted.

The church\'s Romanesque style was designed by architect John T. Comes [masked]) for the firm Rutan and Russell. Comes also designed Saint John the Baptist Church also in Lawrenceville for the Beezer Brothers architectural firm. Construction for St. Augustine Church began in September of 1899 and was dedicated on May 21 1901. The beautiful stained glass windows are also wonderful pieces of history. They were imported from Munich Germany. The parish has been operated by the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor Capuchin (OFM Cap) since the 1870s when there was a call for German speaking priests put out by Bishop Domenec early in the history of the Diocese of Pittsburgh. There will be a tour of the church immediately following Mass. We can\'t wait for you to witness the beauty of this exquisite example of German Romanesque Catholic Churches in Pittsburgh! Bring your cameras invite family friends and neighbors to help rediscover another one of Pittsburgh\'s hidden gems that deserves to be a part of our vibrant community once more!

All films are co-presented by Silk Screen.  A live poetry reading by Persian Pittsburgh will be at 7:30. The movie starts at 8:00 pm.Based on Satrapi\xe2\x80\x99s graphic novel about her life in pre and post-revolutionary Iran and then in Europe. The film traces Satrapi\xe2\x80\x99s growth from child to rebellious punk-loving teenager in Iran. In the background are the growing tensions of the political climate in Iran in the 70s and 80s with members of her liberal-leaning family detained and then executed and the background of the disastrous Iran/Iraq war. The film was co-winner of the Jury Prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. However it has drawn complaints from the Iranian government and was initially banned in Lebanon after some clerics found it to be \xe2\x80\x9coffensive to Iran and Islam.\xe2\x80\x9d On 7 October 2011 the film was shown on the Tunisian private television station Nessma. A day later a demonstration formed and marched on the station. Nabil Karoui the owner of Nessma TV faced trial in Tunis on charges of \xe2\x80\x9cviolating sacred values\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdisturbing the public order\xe2\x80\x9d. He was found guilty and ordered to pay a fine of 2400 dinars ($1700; \xc2\xa31000) a much more lenient punishment than predicted. A live poetry reading by Persian Pittsburgh will precede the screening., Alphabet City Tent, Pittsburgh, 320 Sampsonia Way, -80.011147, 40.457176

This is Rebekah (http://rebekahgambleholisticpractitioner.com). One effort Sparkle and I are making for our communities this year is something we\'re calling "Open Discussion." This is a donation based event we\'re going to bring you once or twice a month. Basically I will be available in the shop during an hour to an hour and a half one evening a month in order to take questions and have an open discussion on a pre-chosen topic for that time period. Sparkle and I have both noticed discussions on when it\'s better to use herbs or essential oils going on around us so we decided that should be one of our topics this month. I will bring a bunch of dried herbs supplements essences and the like and she and I will both bring oils to this event. I am a qualified herbalist and holistic practitioner and Sparkle just so happens to have gone to school at Aroma Apothecary a school for aromatherapy. So you\'ve got two good and qualified people on your hands and lots of fun stuff to play with this month. Which herbs do what? What\'s the difference between an infusion and a decoction and how do I know when to make each? How do I make and use each? How much of an essential oil should I use for which purpose? How can I tell the quality of herbs teas and oils? How does aromatherapy work?We can answer questions like these and many many more. If we can answer your questions we will. If we don\'t know the answer I\'ll point you in the direction you need to go either towards a practitioner or towards a book. This event is being offered without charge in the interest of building a healthy community but if you\'d like to support my work and the shop donations are happily accepted. Look for a new topic and a new conversation in September!, Sparkledragon\'s Magical Emporium, Pittsburgh, 2120 Broadway Ave, -80.033188, 40.404533

Live Love Latch! is an event to celebrate breastfeeding and to highlight breastfeeding support. Everyone is invited to attend and sign the declaration of support. You do not need to be breastfeeding to be included. Family friends doctors lactation consultants midwives businesses legislators and anyone else who supports breastfeeding in our community are welcome. The key goal of Live Love Latch! is to raise awareness of how a supportive community can help nursing dyads breastfeed successfully. The secondary goal is to break the previous year\'s record for breastfeeding supporters attending. Last year\'s national record was 9028! In the spirit of the Surgeon General\'s Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding this celebration provides an opportunity to educate everyone about how they can be supportive to breastfeeding families and how this natural way of parenting effects the community as a whole. Any businesses interested in sponsoring the event through a donation are welcome to contact us ([masked]), Northland Public Library, Pittsburgh, 300 Cumberland Road, -80.034645, 40.571003

Dr. Timothy Pearce Assistant Curator &amp; Head Section of Mollusks Carnegie Museum of Natural History. "Wily Land Snails of Pennsylvania: Where Do They Live and Which Are Rare?"A local scientist\'s work is dramatically increasing what we know about Pennsylvania\'s 129 land snail species. For the Pennsylvania Land Snail Atlas Project Dr. Timothy Pearce collected 17472 records of Pennsylvania land snails from modern field work and museum specimens documenting thousands of new county records. Many minute species are now known to be widespread although they previously seemed to be rare. Dr. Pearce assistant curator and head of the section of mollusks at Carnegie Museum of Natural History will discuss his work in "Wily Land Snails of Pennsylvania: Where Do They Live and Which Are Rare?" at Caf\xc3\xa9 Scientifique. Dr. Pearce gained an important historical perspective on ecology while working toward a master\'s degree in snail paleontology at University of California at Berkeley then he continued studying snail ecology for a PhD at University of Michigan. During a year-long post-doctoral study in Madagascar he helped find more than 600 undescribed land snail species. During his first curator job at the Delaware Museum he was awarded that institution\'s first National Science Foundation grant. His current research at Carnegie Museum of Natural History ecological snail studies in the northeastern and northwestern regions of the United States and in Colombia South America.

The church\'s Romanesque style was designed by architect John T. Comes [masked]) for the firm Rutan and Russell. Comes also designed Saint John the Baptist Church also in Lawrenceville for the Beezer Brothers architectural firm. Construction for St. Augustine Church began in September of 1899 and was dedicated on May 21 1901. The beautiful stained glass windows are also wonderful pieces of history. They were imported from Munich Germany. The parish has been operated by the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor Capuchin (OFM Cap) since the 1870s when there was a call for German speaking priests put out by Bishop Domenec early in the history of the Diocese of Pittsburgh. There will be a tour of the church immediately following Mass. We can\'t wait for you to witness the beauty of this exquisite example of German Romanesque Catholic Churches in Pittsburgh! Bring your cameras invite family friends and neighbors to help rediscover another one of Pittsburgh\'s hidden gems that deserves to be a part of our vibrant community once more! You will not be disappointed! We will be welcoming people outside in front of the church. We will have a space for our group to sit in. Please be sure to introduce yourself so that we can give you a name tag., Our Lady Of the Angels, Pittsburgh, 225 37th Street , -79.963923, 40.465831

The format is mostly the same: one of us does a guided meditation we have a brief break if needed and then the other does a complementary meditation. The whole event takes about an hour. We have some folding chairs a couch and some cushions to sit on but feel free to bring a mat or something to sit on if you have special needs to ensure they are accommodated. Tea coffee and water are available at the event in the lobby. I am excited to welcome Bob Lardin to be my guest at this month\xe2\x80\x99s event. Robert W Lardin Jr. is a former Catholic Deacon and a retired systems analyst. He is currently active at Allegheny General Hospital in the Holistic Medicine program where he practices Reiki. Bob is a certified hypnotherapist a Knight\xe2\x80\x99s Templar Reiki Master and is certified in Quantum touch. He enjoys working with all sorts of conditions and situations in the hospital as well as teaching his methods when the opportunity arises. Bob teaches hypnosis Reiki and meditation in his spare time and spends lots of time practicing. I will open the event with a meditation on connecting to the sky and earth energies. We will work on feeling the upward and downward flow of energy in the body which is the foundation for energy work shamanic journeying and many other practices. You will start to notice different aspects of this energy flow during the meditation which has the goal of helping your overall awareness of your field and it\xe2\x80\x99s energetic anatomy. After a break following this first meditation you will draw on these flows and this ground work as Bob assists you with a meditation that has roots in the Templar form of Reiki. This second meditation will use oils. Bob will then demonstrate the different forms of energy he works with in Reiki and Quantum Touch and show you how to use these different energies in your meditation practice to heal and create change. The event is $10 pre-registered or $15 at the door. You may send pre-registration or pre-payments to [masked] through paypal. We are very limited on space for these events and preference is given to those who register ahead of time. Hope to see you there!, Embody Healing LLC, Pittsburgh, 2609 Brownsville Road, -79.978386, 40.385338

11064482, 16, Quantum Cranberry: Exploring Your Infinite Possibilities, Quantum Cranberry meetings are an interactive open forum where you will meet with other kindred spirits to learn about the perfect union of science and spirituality. Modern science suggests that all things are possible in the sub-atomic realm where quantum particles form molecules that create your body and your brain and link to your soul. Our meetings will explore the limitless possibilities that already lie within you. Structured like a university discussion group topics will focus on personal and spiritual growth working towards a PhD for your soul. We will study explore and discuss a variety of spiritual and scientific works such as The Secret What the Bleep Do We Know?! A Course of Miracles Leap! The Divine Matrix The Power of Now etc. We will also link together a variety of different spiritual philosophies such as Buddhism Taoism Hinduism Gnosticism Christianity and the Kabbalah all while using quantum physics to scientifically support their wisdom.,Cranberry Twp, new-age-spirituality, -80.1100006104, 40.7099990845, Philosophy; Meditation; Self-Improvement; Consciousness; Spirituality; Intellectual Discussion; Science and Spirituality; Positive Thinking; Spiritual Growth; Quantum Physics; Spiritual Development; Transformation; The Science of Spirituality; Spiritual Discussion; Spiritual Awakening; ,11064482, Level 16 - The Projector: You Are A Movie Star, 2015-08-05 17:00:00, Science really doesn't much cooler than this: over the past few decades it has become more and more clear that we are living in a hologram! What does that mean? Well for starters it means that life is much more like a movie than you could ever possibly imagine. And thanks to concepts discussed in earlier levels it also means that YOU are the director and scriptwriter and the actor/actress and the key grip (we'll explain that one later) of this movie. However you are not the producer. That duty belongs to God. :-), Quantum Counseling Services, Cranberry Twp, One Landmark North Suite 205A 20399 Route 19 Brandt Drive, -80.105698, 40.692699

Once you realize that reality is about the evolution of your consciousness (Level 12) you either succeed at it or try again and again and again (and again if necessary) until you succeed at it. As they say in A Course In Miracles "Free will does not mean that\xc2\xa0you\xc2\xa0can\xc2\xa0establish the curriculum it means\xc2\xa0only\xc2\xa0that\xc2\xa0you\xc2\xa0can elect what\xc2\xa0you\xc2\xa0want to take\xc2\xa0at a given\xc2\xa0time" ... and fortunately there is no such thing as time (Level 15) so you have eternity to succeed! (That takes the pressure off.) In this group we will watch scenes from the movie "Revolver" and process the delicate battle between one\'s ego and soul., Quantum Counseling Services, Cranberry Twp, One Landmark North Suite 205A 20399 Route 19 Brandt Drive, -80.105698, 40.692699

To be or not to be? Be or not be\xc2\xa0what?!? We will answer that question in this group after we process what it means! The first 16 groups have led up to this point - the halfway point of the series - where we begin to gradually shift the focus away from the science of the material world and more toward the soul of the spiritual world., Quantum Counseling Services, Cranberry Twp, One Landmark North Suite 205A 20399 Route 19 Brandt Drive, -80.105698, 40.692699

There are many applications to entanglement but our purposes are primarily for spiritual insight. Beliefs such as "everything happens for a reason" and "we are all one" along with karma and even some principles of the Kabbalah can be linked to entanglement (in addition to computers cell phones the internet etc. but we will stick with the easy stuff for this meetup)., Quantum Counseling Services, Cranberry Twp, One Landmark North Suite 205A 20399 Route 19 Brandt Drive, -80.105698, 40.692699

And truly miraculous! This meetup done with the flair of quantum physics as a guide will dive deep into the text and process its soul-inspiring concepts encouraging all participants to walk their pathway toward Truth. (Note: this is a heavily spiritual group with a strong emphasis on the presence of God in all of our lives ... we will use science as support for the concepts in the course but the focus is primarily spiritual.), Quantum Counseling Services, Cranberry Twp, One Landmark North Suite 205A 20399 Route 19 Brandt Drive, -80.105698, 40.692699

Reality is not "out there" as much as it is "in here." When Jesus stated in Luke 17:21\xc2\xa0that "the kingdom of God is within you" he was referring to the Observer Phenomenon ... well maybe not specifically but during this group we will demonstrate the link between the "observer" (i.e. you) and the physical world with which you interact., Quantum Counseling Services, Cranberry Twp, One Landmark North Suite 205A 20399 Route 19 Brandt Drive, -80.105698, 40.692699

You can throw all of that out! You do not need science to understand spirit. In Luke 17:20 Jesus says "The kingdom of God is not coming in ways that can be observed." And for all intents and purposes\xc2\xa0brilliant mathematician Kurt G\xc3\xb6del proved precisely that! This group begins to set the stage for the final 11 "spiritual" levels of truth., Quantum Counseling Services, Cranberry Twp, One Landmark North Suite 205A 20399 Route 19 Brandt Drive, -80.105698, 40.692699

Set ... Action!, 2015-08-05 22:30:00, The "Incito Veritas" founding fathers (which included females of course\xc2\xa0as no soul has a gender) originally called this group "Fight Club" and first intended to keep that\xc2\xa0name\xc2\xa0while maintaining secrecy. So much for that. But the spirit of Fight Club remains the idea of trying to bring out the best in each other through the evolution of consciousness. As Brad Pitt said about the movie "Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it." And not fear the pain! In this meetup\xc2\xa0we discuss ways that concepts introduced during the Incito Veritas series can be applied to our daily lives. We will learn and grow as we process our experiences.

Well there are many ways to think of it ... a dream ... a playground ... or my favorite way of thinking of it a Costume Party! In this group we will explore this concept and look closely at what your costume is - your human ego., Quantum Counseling Services, Cranberry Twp, One Landmark North Suite 205A 20399 Route 19 Brandt Drive, -80.105698, 40.692699

Scientifically it means that "things" can be in more than one place at a given time. Spiritually it is the backbone for Matthew 19:26 when Jesus says "With God all things are possible.", Quantum Counseling Services, Cranberry Twp, One Landmark North Suite 205A 20399 Route 19 Brandt Drive, -80.105698, 40.692699

With so many people in the Meetup sometimes it can be challenge meeting/mingling especially for relatively new members when attending other events at busy art galleries outdoor festivals and\xc2\xa0performances at large venues such as the Benedum. So perhaps a series of fun\xc2\xa0activities that bring lots of people together would also help with\xc2\xa0introductions and spotting other\xc2\xa0members at future events. In terms of the Meetup for the Little Italy Days portion of the event there are\xc2\xa0several options although everyone is encouraged to arrive as\xc2\xa0early as possible to enjoy all the festivities including live music and great street food. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Please gather at the Pittsburgh Dance Center (4765 Liberty Ave above Starbucks)\xc2\xa0at 5 PM where you can drop off the wines and\xc2\xa0then the\xc2\xa0group can walk around\xc2\xa0to check out Little Italy Days. We hope to\xc2\xa0see everyone\xc2\xa0back at the studio at 6-6:30 PM to enjoy some wine/pastries and then we will get the party started with a Foxtrot\xc2\xa0class at 7 PM! After the first 45-minute\xc2\xa0lesson\xc2\xa0people will have the option\xc2\xa0to continue dancing until 9:30 PM\xc2\xa0or\xc2\xa0simply enjoy some\xc2\xa0Italian wines\xc2\xa0snacks good conversation and lots of\xc2\xa0laughs. And there will even be a second 45-minute class for those that are interested!! This will be a fantastic event bringing people together --\xc2\xa0Meetup groups PDC clients and others from the community that may also\xc2\xa0stop by after Little Italy Days. In addition to the usual dance lessons people expect (salsa rhumba etc.)\xc2\xa0just wait until we learn some dances to Italian music with familiar songs from Dean Martin Frank Sinatra Andrea Boccelli Louis Prima\xc2\xa0etc. while enjoying Italian wines! While Pittsburgh has a vibrant cultural scene including classical and contemporary dance this is our chance to experience\xc2\xa0being a bit more than spectators while learning more about the art of dance. Unlike a restaurant where people spend most of the time talking with those seated nearby the \'Dance Lesson Wine Lesson\' will be less formal so people should be able to meet many others while enjoying the group dance lesson and sharing pizza/wine. While\xc2\xa0there are\xc2\xa0other Meetup groups and organizations in the region that are specifically focused on dance\xc2\xa0this event is also\xc2\xa0an opportunity for people to see if they might enjoy taking up dance\xc2\xa0in a relaxed informal atmosphere.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because\xc2\xa0some might be more comfortable bringing a friend for the dance lesson guests are certainly welcome. So when you RSVP please indicate if you\'ll bringing one or more friends. This event costs only $10/person -- please bring cash at the\xc2\xa0door -- and is BYOB wine. The $10 includes complimentary pastries and\xc2\xa0snacks. What a great deal! But\xc2\xa0to make the wine appreciation session more interesting please feel free to bring either your favorite bottle of wine -- or something you\'ve never tried before -- which costs less than $15/bottle. Italian wine is suggested for this event although there will also be local Pennsylvania wineries participating at Little Italy Days for wine tastings/purchases and so you could also bring a bottle back to the dance studio. For those that live close to the larger state stores this\xc2\xa0might be a chance to check out one of the Chairmen\'s Selection wines. It would be fantastic if this event included a variety of white and red wines representing different regions of Italy for the group to try. And if you don\'t drink that is\xc2\xa0certainly OK as this event is about having fun bringing people together and learning a little more about ballroom\xc2\xa0dance.\xc2\xa0 To enhance this event it would be great if those that were interested in arriving a bit earlier\xc2\xa0on\xc2\xa0Sunday afternoon August 23\xc2\xa0to Little Italy Days could post some comments. Perhaps a group could be organized to check out even more of the festival or having a dinner before the dance lesson. Also\xc2\xa0please let us know if\xc2\xa0you\xc2\xa0have any preferences on the dance lesson (in addition to the\xc2\xa0dances for Italian\xc2\xa0music)\xc2\xa0 We hope to see everyone on Sunday\xc2\xa0August 23!

This will be a great\xc2\xa0opportunity\xc2\xa0to spend a weekend afternoon in a relaxing atmosphere\xc2\xa0at one of our region's signature festivals.\xc2\xa0We'll walk around a bit while checking out\xc2\xa0booths featuring\xc2\xa0local artists as well as a wide range of artists from around the country working in different mediums (painting sculpture etc.).\xc2\xa0 We'll have a chance to visit\xc2\xa0various Shadyside boutiques shops and galleries mingled with national retailers in a neighborhood of tree-lined streets and\xc2\xa0historic homes\xc2\xa0and distinctive restaurants.\xc2\xa0 Depending on the interests of the group we'll also have plenty of time to take some breaks for ice cream cool drinks and perhaps even\xc2\xa0a lunch or dinner. The Shadyside Arts Festival involves hundreds of artists/activities along Walnut Street -- centered primarily between the intersections with S. Aiken\xc2\xa0and Ivy. What started out as a neighborhood street fair is now regarded as one of the top shows in our region. The complete schedule of artists and activities will probably be announced sometime during late Spring or early summer\xc2\xa0and then we'll plan some specific Meetup opportunities to check out artist booths. For more information on the \xc2\xa0Shadyside Art Festival festival please visit http://www.artfestival.com/Festivals/Shadyside_The_Art_Festival_on_Walnut_Street_Pittsburgh_Pennsylvania_August.ASPX MEETUP Considerations Since the weekend forecast is looking pretty good we'll arrange Meetup groups for both Saturday and Sunday afternoon. As always it is also fine if\xc2\xa0people prefer to check\xc2\xa0out the festival on their own (with family/friends)\xc2\xa0or in smaller groups. One gathering location is at Brueggers (corner of S. Aiken and Walnut) on Saturday August 29 from 2:30-3 PM and 4:30-5 PM and Sunday August 30 from 3-3:30 PM.\xc2\xa0 We'd also like to give members a few more options. While some may spend only an hour or two at the festival others will stay longer or may want to have lunch or dinner or go shopping along Walnut Street. When you RSVP please indicate if you might also like to consider\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0lunch/dinner at a local Shadyside\xc2\xa0restaurant so we may be able to adjust the meeting\xc2\xa0times. We can also post additional locations/times so members have a chance to meet/mingle depending on when they arrive and how long they decide to stay at the festival. Parking While there is a Pittsburgh Parking Authority garage in Shadyside\xc2\xa0which\xc2\xa0charges fairly reasonable rates ($3-$10 depending on how long one stays) the garage may be busy and thus many people visiting Shadyside Arts Festival opt for street parking and then just walk as there are many side streets in this neighborhood. But if you want to try swinging by the garage it is located at 714 Bellefonte Street (a short distance off Walnut Street) or call[masked] or visit their website http://www.pittsburghparking.com/shadyside-garage\xc2\xa0 There is also plenty of public transportation that serves this neighborhood with stops within\xc2\xa02 blocks of the festival (64\xc2\xa071B\xc2\xa071D 75) and\xc2\xa03-5 blocks of the festival (P1 71A\xc2\xa0 71C 82 86) Stay tuned for updates!, Walnut Street in Shadyside, Pittsburgh, Walnut Street, -79.93341, 40.45142

Please note that there will be a tour of the church immediately following Mass (which is usually less than an hour long) As a reminder it is important to recognize that while everyone may have different religious beliefs we should also try to be respectful and welcoming and realize that we can sometimes have a tendency to overlook historical things in our own region.\xc2\xa0 As always it is also fine if you wish to attend on your own with family/friends instead.\xc2\xa0 Pittsburgh Mass Mob is a group that enjoys going to different churches which have historical significance in terms of architecture rich ethnic/cultural tradition etc.\xc2\xa0 Typically 30-80 from the Pittsburgh Mass Mob group visit a different church which is selected each month.\xc2\xa0 Of note is that their are similar Mass Mob groups all across the country where visitors are struck by what they experience with comments such as \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like walking back in history.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Brother John Harvey has graciously invited the Pittsburgh Mass Mob to visit the gorgeous historic Saint Augustine Catholic Church (which is also known as Our Lady of\xc2\xa0Angels Parish)\xc2\xa0in the Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh. The church\'s Romanesque style was designed by architect John T. Comes [masked]) for the firm Rutan and Russell. Comes also designed Saint John the Baptist Church also in Lawrenceville for the Beezer Brothers architectural firm. Construction for St. Augustine Church began in September of 1899 and was dedicated on May 21 1901. The beautiful stained glass windows are also wonderful pieces of history. They were imported from Munich Germany. The parish has been operated by the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor Capuchin (OFM Cap) since the 1870s when there was a call for German speaking priests put out by Bishop Domenec early in the history of the Diocese of Pittsburgh. Our Lady of the Angels was established in 1993 as part of the diocese\'s reorganization and revitalization project in part driven by declining populations in various neighborhoods.\xc2\xa0 The parish was formed by the merger of St. Augustine Holy Family St. John the Baptist and St. Mary.\xc2\xa0 Of the four churches St. John the Baptist was sold shortly after the merger.\xc2\xa0 The remaining three churches at first remained open.\xc2\xa0 However after a few years the parish determined that the congregation could not support three church buildings.\xc2\xa0 St. Mary Church closed in November of 2004.\xc2\xa0 Holy Family Church closed on Dec. 28 2008.\xc2\xa0 St. Augustine Church remains open and continues to serve the parish. There will be a tour of the church immediately following Mass.  For more information on the history of Saint Augustine Catholic Church please visit http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~njm1/StAugJub3.html We can\'t wait for you to witness the beauty of this exquisite example of German Romanesque Catholic Churches in Pittsburgh! Bring your cameras invite family friends and neighbors to help rediscover another one of Pittsburgh\'s hidden gems that deserves to be a part of our vibrant community once more! You will not be disappointed! We will be welcoming people outside in front of the church. We will have a space for our group to sit in. Please be sure to introduce yourself so that we can give you a name tag.

RSVPing to only group is necessary.    http://www.carnegielibrary.org/locations/brookline/     This will be our third meetup at the library in Brookline. I was able to reserve the larger room this time so there will not need to be a cap. This room fits about 40 people. The library closes at 5:00 so we will need to head out immediately once the meetup is over.    Parking is either diagonal on the side of the street the library is on or parallel on the opposite side. It is never difficult to find a spot to park but paid parking is enforced on Saturdays unless you find a side street to park on for free so be sure to pay at a pay station because they do ticket on Saturdays.\xc2\xa0     Topics you would like to discuss are always welcome and please feel free to contact me with any suggestions. I'm learning this as I go but hope that our meetings are productive and helpful to those who go. \xc2\xa0As I said at our last meeting getting that foot out the door can be the hardest part but is often very rewarding once you do so. \xc2\xa0, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh - Brookline, Pittsburgh, 708 Brookline Blvd, -80.021233, 40.394665

This is Rebekah (http://rebekahgambleholisticpractitioner.com). One effort Sparkle and I are making for our communities this year is something we\'re calling "Open Discussion." This is a donation based event we\'re going to bring you once or twice a month. Basically I will be available in the shop during an hour to an hour and a half one evening a month in order to take questions and have an open discussion on a pre-chosen topic for that time period. Sparkle and I have both noticed discussions on when it\'s better to use herbs or essential oils going on around us so we decided that should be one of our topics this month. I will bring a bunch of dried herbs supplements essences and the like and she and I will both bring oils to this event. I am a qualified herbalist and holistic practitioner and Sparkle just so happens to have gone to school at Aroma Apothecary a school for aromatherapy. So you\'ve got two good and qualified people on your hands and lots of fun stuff to play with this month. Which herbs do what? What\'s the difference between an infusion and a decoction and how do I know when to make each? How do I make and use each? How much of an essential oil should I use for which purpose? How can I tell the quality of herbs teas and oils? How does aromatherapy work?We can answer questions like these and many many more. If we can answer your questions we will. If we don\'t know the answer I\'ll point you in the direction you need to go either towards a practitioner or towards a book. This event is being offered without charge in the interest of building a healthy community but if you\'d like to support my work and the shop donations are happily accepted. Look for a new topic and a new conversation in September!, Sparkledragon\'s Magical Emporium, Pittsburgh, 2120 Broadway Ave, -80.033188, 40.404533

We wanted to do something different and maybe a little new age-y and talk about rocks and such. I\'m going to bring my stones and show you how they are used in my practice for mediation journeying and healing work including the stones I used in my successful recovery from several feminine disorders. I will also share with you how some of these rocks were used in ancient medicine and healing practices and how some are used today. A friend of mine Dan happens to be a rock person and is going to bring some of his favorites to talk about too. Joyce has many varieties of some of these stones in shop for sale if you would like to take them home (and she\'s incredibly reasonable so I often buy stones here). This is going to be as interactive as you want it to be; you will have the ability to work with these stones if you choose to but nothing will be forced on you in the least.

The church's Romanesque style was designed by architect John T. Comes [masked]) for the firm Rutan and Russell. Comes also designed Saint John the Baptist Church also in Lawrenceville for the Beezer Brothers architectural firm. Construction for St. Augustine Church began in September of 1899 and was dedicated on May 21 1901. The beautiful stained glass windows are also wonderful pieces of history. They were imported from Munich Germany. The parish has been operated by the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor Capuchin (OFM Cap) since the 1870s when there was a call for German speaking priests put out by Bishop Domenec early in the history of the Diocese of Pittsburgh. There will be a tour of the church immediately following Mass. We can't wait for you to witness the beauty of this exquisite example of German Romanesque Catholic Churches in Pittsburgh! Bring your cameras invite family friends and neighbors to help rediscover another one of Pittsburgh's hidden gems that deserves to be a part of our vibrant community once more! You will not be disappointed! We will be welcoming people outside in front of the church. We will have a space for our group to sit in.

If you ask a CEO an open-source developer and a computer science professor you\'ll get very different answers. We\'ll take a guided tour of the history of ethical thought and apply it to software development in order to understand how others have defined it and perhaps help to develop your own ethical framework. Along the way we\'ll answer questions such as: What would Nietzsche say about malware developers? How are contracting companies like Moses? Would Kant write closed-source software?

Join us for a game of flag football on Thursday night. It has been requested that we play with a slightly smaller ball than regulation so it can be easier to throw and catch. Two people who have participated in recent events have flags/belts for us to use but if neither of them are able to make it we'll play touch football instead. It's starting to get to the point where we're going to be losing daylight a lot quicker so plan on being there around 6:30 so we can get a good 90 minutes of playtime in. Don't forget to bring some friends!, Junction Hollow Field, Pittsburgh, Boundary St, 0, 0

If we have too many people we'll either have something else to do in the deep outfield or find a way to run a mini tournament so everyone gets good playing time. \xc2\xa0I'm all about making this the most fun it can be and understand the challenges we have with too many people.\xc2\xa0 The new rules definitely worked well and I think we'll keep the bases closer together so we have more scoring in the games. \xc2\xa0We've been playing on the actual field lately so make sure you prepare with clothing you can slide on the dirt with. \xc2\xa0I'd advise not wearing jeans or all black as it has been very hot for the games lately. Hope you can join us and can bring some friends!, Armstrong Field, Pittsburgh, 13th Street/Sarah, 0, 0

Since receiving it I have heard it mentioned by at least 5 other people with a few of them being avid players. Since the game is only a 2 vs 2 game and the sets being very expensive ($60 each) I\'m going to make this a "Lawn Game" Meetup so we can have a bunch of different activities going on at once. We can do Kan Jam cornhole and Spikeball...and if we have enough space we can try Blitzball which I should be getting in the mail this week. We\'re going to run this Meetup at the Oval in Schenley Park because we\'re not going to need a ton of space but we\'ll definitely need flat ground for all of our events. Look for us at the top of the stairs near the tennis courts. Each game we have needs 4 players to play them so don\'t hesitate to bring some friends!, Schenley Park tennis courts, Pittsburgh, Overlook Drive, -79.94216, 40.431979

This game got quite popular last year and was requested as our Meetup of the week for 7 straight weeks. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The name of the game is Big Ball. I created this game during my junior year at IUP. The best way to describe the game is that it\'s a mix between Soccer and Ultimate Frisbee but we use a ball that\'s about 45" in diameter. We played it every week for 2 years on the practice soccer field. There is no physical contact with other players permitted but you can use the ball however you want. Any part of your body can touch the ball and there\'s no height limit on the goals. Also NO CLEATS OR SPIKES ALLOWED! To see a video of this game in action from 3 years ago check it out here:\xc2\xa0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deBQzfRsBg0 We will be playing this game at Junction Hollow Field off of Second Avenue a bit past the Hot Metal Bridge. Here are some more details &amp; rules. Field size we need is about 60 - 70 yards based on how many players we get (best games are at least 7 vs 7) There are 3 lines that matter in the game...the goal line on each side and the line at the center of the field. There are no out of bounds lines on the sides of the field. Players can dribble roll kick throw or carry the ball for 3 steps The goals are 12 feet wide and there is no height limit on the goal. The game relies heavily on defense. There are also no regulations for goalies or a goalie box. This means your goalie can play mid field if he wants or you can even have 3 goalies...they can even piggyback on each other to be "taller" if they want. You just lose those additional players in the field Both teams start the game and after each goal at mid-field. The team that wins the coin toss or just got scored on start with the ball. As soon as anything crosses mid-field (the ball OR one of your players that\'s getting a running start) the other team is allowed to cross the line and start playing defense. As mentioned above there is no physical contact with other players but you can use the ball however you want. If you\'re in the process of taking your 3 steps you can plow people over with the ball. If someone is charging you you can kick the ball at them you can hit people with the ball...I just prefer you don\'t aim for the head. If you do actually blatantly contact someone you get a warning and a 2 minute penalty. Second offense in the same game gets you ejected from the game. This only happened once in 2 years of playing as the ball does a good enough job of not getting players TOO close to each other... The ball is built like an exercise ball but it\'s VERY heavy. I would strongly advise players not try to punch the ball while it\'s in the air hit it with one arm or kick it with your feet as it could easily result in an injury or twisting of the body. On that note it\'s easiest to "kick" the ball with your knees or thigh hit it with two hands punching close together or hit with the forearms while hands are clenched at the fists. We sometimes have players get into a "scrum" around the ball and it doesn\'t move for a while. If that happens and the ball doesn\'t move for 3 - 5 seconds we\'ll have a jump ball from where the "scrum" took place. Games are normally played until 11 and we switch sides of the field when one team scores 6. We usually take a little half-time break at that point too. We have had many girls play the sport and they loved it. \xc2\xa0A few of them even had trouble picking the ball up but they still loved the game. Some of them were actually our most die-hard players. We normally start every game kicking and throwing the ball in a circle to get everyone warmed up for how big and heavy the ball actually is The game is actually the most fun in the rain because of our most important rule... NO CLEATS OR SPIKES OF ANY KIND! All players must wear tennis shoes or some other kind of non-grip shoe so they don\'t have any advantage in the dirt or grass. That\'s the way we\'ve always played and I feel that makes everyone very even when it comes to maneuverability on the field. You can only imagine what some rain puddles and slick grass add to a game where no one has traction. Good times. Join us on Thursday August 13th at Junction Hollow Field in Squirrel Hill for a game of Big Ball. \xc2\xa0Just show up to the park to play and bring some friends. \xc2\xa0Don\'t forget the number one rule...No SPIKES!, Junction Hollow Field, Pittsburgh, Boundary St, 0, 0

His debut already includes a handful of elements familiar to fans of subsequent work: a deceptively spare style often branded \xe2\x80\x9cminimalist\xe2\x80\x9d; actor Lee Kang-sheng as the silent and sullen Hsiao-kang; copious amounts of water whether pouring from the sky or bubbling up from a clogged drain; and enough urban anomie to ensure that even the subtle humor in evidence is tinged with pathos.\xc2\xa0 The loosely structured plot involves Hsiao-kang a despondent cram school student who becomes obsessed with young petty thief Ah-tze after Ah-tze smashes the rearview mirror of a taxi driven by Hsiao-kang\xe2\x80\x99s father. Hsiao-kang stalks Ah-tze and his buddy Ah-ping as they hang out in the film\xe2\x80\x99s iconic arcade (featuring a telling poster of James Dean on the wall) and other locales around Taipei and ultimately takes his revenge.\xc2\xa0 Neon God is a remarkably impressive first film that hints at the promise of its director: a talent confirmed by Tsai\xe2\x80\x99s equally stunning second feature Vive L\xe2\x80\x99Amour (Golden Lion Venice) and continuing to his most recent film Stray Dogs which ranked high on many \xe2\x80\x9cbest of\xe2\x80\x9d lists last year. Though showing such diverse influences as the French New Wave Wong Kar-wai\xe2\x80\x99s early films\xe2\x80\x94and yes Rebel Without a Cause\xe2\x80\x94Tsai\xe2\x80\x99s film is most remarkable for introducing his startlingly unique vision to world cinema.

It explores Garvey\xe2\x80\x99s dramatic successes and failures before his fall into obscurity. Among the film\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful sequences are interviews with people who were part of the Garvey movement decades ago. These interviews communicate the appeal of Garvey\xe2\x80\x99s revolutionary ideas to a generation of African Americans and reveal how he invested hundreds and thousands of black men and women with a newfound sense of pride., Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh - Homewood Branch, Pittsburgh, 7101 Hamilton Ave, -79.899214, 40.455284

Unable to fit in amongst these older slackers Tomas discovers that unsung Mexican folk-rock hero Epigmenio Cruz has been hospitalized somewhere in the city.

This is a donation based event we\'re going to bring you once or twice a month. Basically I will be available in the shop during an hour to an hour and a half one evening a month in order to take questions and have an open discussion on a pre-chosen topic for that time period. We wanted to do something different and maybe a little new age-y and talk about rocks and such. I\'m going to bring my stones and show you how they are used in my practice for mediation journeying and healing work including the stones I used in my successful recovery from several feminine disorders. I will also share with you how some of these rocks were used in ancient medicine and healing practices and how some are used today. A friend of mine Dan happens to be a rock person and is going to bring some of his favorites to talk about too. Joyce has many varieties of some of these stones in shop for sale if you would like to take them home (and she\'s incredibly reasonable so I often buy stones here). This is going to be as interactive as you want it to be; you will have the ability to work with these stones if you choose to but nothing will be forced on you in the least. If we can answer your questions we will. If we don\'t know the answer I\'ll point you in the direction you need to go either towards a practitioner or towards a book. This event is being offered without charge in the interest of building a healthy community but if you\'d like to support my work and the shop donations are happily accepted. Look for a new topic and a new conversation in September!, Sparkledragon\'s Magical Emporium, Pittsburgh, 2120 Broadway Ave, -80.033188, 40.404533

This is Rebekah (http://rebekahgambleholisticpractitioner.com). One effort Sparkle and I are making for our communities this year is something we\'re calling "Open Discussion." This is a donation based event we\'re going to bring you once or twice a month. Basically I will be available in the shop during an hour to an hour and a half one evening a month in order to take questions and have an open discussion on a pre-chosen topic for that time period. Sparkle and I have both noticed discussions on when it\'s better to use herbs or essential oils going on around us so we decided that should be one of our topics this month. I will bring a bunch of dried herbs supplements essences and the like and she and I will both bring oils to this event. I am a qualified herbalist and holistic practitioner and Sparkle just so happens to have gone to school at Aroma Apothecary a school for aromatherapy. So you\'ve got two good and qualified people on your hands and lots of fun stuff to play with this month. Which herbs do what? What\'s the difference between an infusion and a decoction and how do I know when to make each? How do I make and use each? How much of an essential oil should I use for which purpose? How can I tell the quality of herbs teas and oils? How does aromatherapy work?We can answer questions like these and many many more. If we can answer your questions we will. If we don\'t know the answer I\'ll point you in the direction you need to go either towards a practitioner or towards a book.

There an apple tree bearing fruit of magical properties looms over a garden filled with herbs and edible flowers that possess the power to affect in curious ways anyone who eats them. For nearly a decade 34-year-old Claire Waverley at peace with her family inheritance has lived in the house alone embracing the spirit of the grandmother who raised her ruing her mother's unfortunate destiny and seemingly unconcerned about the fate of her rebellious sister Sydney who freed herself long ago from their small town's constraints. Using her grandmother's mystical culinary traditions Claire has built a successful catering business -- and a carefully controlled utterly predictable life -- upon the family's peculiar gift for making life-altering delicacies: lilac jelly to engender humility for instance or rose geranium wine to call up fond memories. Garden Spells reveals what happens when Sydney returns to Bascom with her young daughter turning Claire's routine existence upside down. With Sydney's homecoming the magic that the quiet caterer has measured into recipes to shape the thoughts and moods of others begins to influence Claire's own emotions in terrifying and delightful ways. As the sisters reconnect and learn to support one another each finds romance where she least expects it while Sydney's child Bay discovers both the safe home she has longed for and her own surprising gifts. With the help of their elderly cousin Evanelle endowed with her own uncanny skills the Waverley women redeem the past embrace the present and take a joyful leap into the future., White Rabbit Cafe and Patisserie, Greensburg, 113 N Main St, -79.544754, 40.303875

But twenty years later Heloise considers it a blessing to be a person who knows how to avoid attention. In the comfortable suburb where she lives she's just a mom the youngish widow with a forgettable job who somehow never misses a soccer game or a school play. In the state capitol she's the redheaded lobbyist with a good cause and a mediocre track record. But in discreet hotel rooms throughout the area she's the woman of your dreams\xe2\x80\x94if you can afford her hourly fee. For more than a decade Heloise has believed she is safe. She has created a rigidly compartmentalized life maintaining no real friendships trusting few confidantes. Only now her secret life a life she was forced to build after the legitimate world turned its back on her is under siege. Her once oblivious accountant is asking loaded questions. Her longtime protector is hinting at new mysterious dangers. Her employees can't be trusted. One county over another so-called suburban madam has been found dead in her car a suicide. Or is it? Nothing is as it seems as Heloise faces a midlife crisis with much higher stakes than most will ever know. And then she learns that her son's father might be released from prison which is problematic because he doesn't know he has a son. The killer and former pimp also doesn't realize that he's serving a life sentence because Heloise betrayed him. But he's clearly beginning to suspect that Heloise has been holding something back all these years. With no formal education no real family and no friends Heloise has to remake her life\xe2\x80\x94again. Disappearing will be the easy part. She's done it before and she can do it again. A new name and a new place aren't hard to come by if you know the right people. The trick will be living long enough to start a new life.\xc2\xa0, Ground Round, Coraopolis, 5980 University Blvd, -80.21772, 40.520031

We have found that beyond ten the ability to critique and be critiqued decreases. Many of our participants have been published and some have achieved awards for their work. We cover many genres and have covered historical fiction science fiction YA fantasy and autobiographical semi-fiction (mostly-true stories but not written in the first person). We don\'t do poetry and have zero experience with plays or screenplays. We currently have no one working on nonfiction but we don\'t rule that out.

Another great meetup last Friday night were we played our feature game and built a better dystopia in Euphoria! \xc2\xa0What a game we had five gamers squaring off to gain the most authority and exert their influence on the new world. \xc2\xa0There were about three of us that had a chance to win the game in the last round but Redbeard pulled off an exciting double move to win the game in a tie breaker! \xc2\xa0Interesting little worker placement game with a neat bumping mechanic. After that game broke we played a game of 7 Wonders that Mathew won\xc2\xa0impressively\xc2\xa0by\xc2\xa0building a science dynasty! It seems like there was a lot of people traveling last week so hopefully this meetup will be a little better attended so we can get some more games on the tables. This week's feature game will be the space themed classic Cosmic Encounters! Redbeard or Mathew will have to bring their copies since I personally don't own it.    Other games that I will bring along with me are... Five Tribes Castles of Mad King Ludwig Viticulture with Tuscany Expansion Francis Drake Dominion Concordia Plus many more brought by our members...\xc2\xa0 Hope to see another great turnout and newcomers are welcome!, Kings Family Restaurant, Canonsburg, 580 McClelland Rd, -80.150963, 40.256481

So as to avoid confusing folks I am not you usual host Russ! Nope it's your friendly neighborhood Redbeard stepping in to do the hosting in his stead for this one night. He is needed elsewhere. We hope to return your regularly scheduled Russ to you very soon. We had a great meetup of 9 or 10 guests the last Friday night that we played  where our feature game was that classic American theme-heavy style game Cosmic Encounter (FFG) where folks invaded neighboring worlds of the other galactic empires and establish a greater number of colonies on opposing homeworlds than their opponents did. Victory went to Russ in one game and another table had game that came right down to the wire between Coleman Matt Wilson and a newcomer Jay. Entirely my fault for not knowing who to give the laurels to on that table. Folks eventually broke out into a game of Viticulture which is a European style game with deep strategies. While that was happening another table tackled games like Roll for the Galaxy Coup Colossal Arena and Neuroshima Hex! So  it seems keeping plans light and loose is likely the way to go for this meetup. Feel very welcome to come out and bring games that interest you. Chances are you will find some folks will be talked into playing it easily enough. Feel very welcome to make your first visit if you have been watching us from afar. The restaurant will be happy to sell you food -- there is no admission. There are plenty of folks who are happy to teach games to newcomers no experience required. We want to make more gamers! We have games We know where to find more games. People are tougher to come by and we hope to be a welcoming and friendly face to any who show up. As for an Idea of what games will be handy I can bring: Cabo Pairs Pinochle Machi Koro Legendary: Marvel Deckbuilding Shadows over Camelot Cloud 9 To Court The King Hanabi Pandemic with its On The Brink expansion Condottiere and Pickomino to name a few. But bring your games! No harm to my ego if we play what you bring instead. I want to see you guys! Drop in. We go until the last person gets sick of hanging around.

3849892, 4, Pittsburgh Silver Screen Dinner & Film Group, Introduction: If you enjoy an evening(or afternoon) out for a nice meal &amp; a movie then this group is perfect for you.  We attend evening &amp; afternoon shows any day of the week as well as weekends. Although a lot of our events do involve a meal before or after a show sometimes we just go to the movie only. You can also join us just for the meal or movie if you want. Your choice entirely.     Note: Women Only Group Sorry Guys    We see movies of every genre; Independent Foreign Oscar Nominated Arthouse Classic Historical Comedies Dramas Horror Romantic Comedies Suspense Action Thrillers and so much more. If you are a fellow movie lover looking to make new friends see exciting new films and enjoy various interesting restaurants around the Pittsburgh area this group is for you.  Come join us so we can share good times and make wonderful memories together.  NOTE: IT IS A REQUIREMENT FOR MEMBERSHIP THAT YOU INCLUDE A PHOTO OF YOURSELF BEFORE MEMBERSHIP CAN BE APPROVED (NO ANIMATED ANIMAL PHOTOS UNLESS MEMBER IS INCULDED AS THE PICTURE MUST BE MAINLY OF YOURSELF OR GROUP/COUPLE PHOTOS THAT ARE CLEAR WHO THE NEW MEMBER IS). We require this because when a new member meets the group for the first time it is essential for the Organizer (myself) and other members to be able to recognize you. This is beneficial for both the group &amp; Assistant Organizers as well as the new member so you are not wandering around the Theater or restaurant trying to find us as well as us trying to meet you for the first time.  IT IS ALSO A REQUIREMENT THAT A PICTURE OF THE MEMBER BE MAINTAINED FOR CONTINUED MEMBERSHIP. NO SHOW POLICY: If you RSVP "yes" for an event and find that cannot make it before the RSVP cutoff time we require that you come back to the Meetup site and update your RSVP to "no" ASAP.  It is also required that if you are scheduled to attend and the event has started that you contact the Organizer or Event Host immediately(Organizers will usually provide a phone number where they can be reached in this instance.) If you fail to attend a scheduled event change your RSVP or contact the event host you will be counted as a No-Show unless there is sudden emergency or problem.  You will be counted as a "No Show" without exception if we do not hear from you.  If a member is a "No Show" 3 times without an explanation to either the Assistant Organizer or myself they will be removed from "Pittsburgh Silver Screen Dinner &amp; a Movie" group.  RSVP\'s: There is not a "Maybe" option for RSVP\'s.     CHRONIC LAST MINUTE CANCELLATIONS: We also have a policy concerning chronic last minute cancellations.    Last minute problems such as weather issues illness accidents staying late at work etc. are of course excusable and understandable circumstances that will arise. However people who sign up for Events and cancel at the last minute will begin being marked as a no-show when the problem starts to become chronic. If this problem continues they will be removed from the group. This includes people who double-book and cancel with our group to attend an Event with another group at the last minute or day of a scheduled Event.   It takes a lot of time and work to plan these Events and Members who do this are wasting myself and the other Assistant Organizers\' time. It is better to wait until you are sure that you can make it rather than sign up then cancel at the last minute. Our group(and other Meetup Groups) have and are having major problems with this issue.   Also we frequently have waiting lists for other Members when an Event is full and it is unfair and discourteous to cancel at the last minute leaving people that are waiting for a cancellation no time to plan to attend the Event or it\'s become so late that they have made other plans.       MY PHONE NUMBER IS AS FOLLOWS: 412-713-0294 in case you need to reach me for any reason.  It is a good idea to put it in your phone contacts so you have it handy if you need to reach me.  NO SALES POLICY: WE ARE STRICTLY A DINNER &amp; MOVIE GROUP(SOCIAL GROUP) AND NOT A SALES OR BUSINESS NETWORKING GROUP OF ANY KIND. THEREFORE WE DO NOT ALLOW ANY MEMBER TO SELL PROMOTE SALES OR DISTRIBUTE ANY MATERIAL TO PROMOTE SELLING OF ANY KIND DURING ANY OF OUR SCHEDULED EVENTS OR POST ANY SUCH ANNOUNCEMENTS LINKS WEBSITES DONATION SITES ETC.

Finding Margo Losing Gus draws its inspiration from the work of bestselling author John Green whose Young Adult novels portray teens struggling to make sense out of life and answer the big questions \xe2\x80\x93 from learning to empathize to dealing with tragedy loss and the realities of life. Green\xe2\x80\x99s best known novel \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fault in Our Stars\xe2\x80\x9d deals with sixteen-year-old cancer survivors confronting their own mortality and attempting to love and support each other with the little time they have left. Geeksdanz\xe2\x80\x99s production jumps into the space between Green\xe2\x80\x99s four novels to explore both the similarities between characters and the diversity of relationships with particular focus on the un-romanticized reality of so-called \xe2\x80\x9cromantic\xe2\x80\x9d relationships and the idea that being there to support your partner in everyday problems is sometimes more important than physical attraction. More info at www.geeksdanz.org $15 Suggested Donation at the door (will be split between Geeksdanz and the Monroeville Library).\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I\'ll be calling a few days ahead to reserve our seats.\xc2\xa0If you can\'t attend on Saturday there will be an additional performance Sunday August 9th at 2 pm.Geeksdanz Artistic Director Ellen Deutsch is a member of N4B., monroeville public library, Monroeville, 4000 Gateway Campus Blvd., -79.755966, 40.429394

Every month we suggest a topic - some are clear cut like spooky tales for Halloween or books adapted to the cinema; others are a little more open to interpretation. This is one of the latter. It is always the case that you choose the title and you share your thoughts with a fellowship of readers who share your interest in literature. At its simplest you read a book and you come and share it with us. Show and Tell-style. Easy. BYOB: Long Distance Dedications is a chance to read a title of either your choosing or a person of your choice. Read a book with a friend or family member who lives afar from our Someplace Special. If you like and it is an option invite your partner to share in the experience - via Skype or FaceTime. This can be a great opportunity to share your book club experience with someone you love - an out-of-state friend or a long-distance love affair a sibling or parent across the country a military spouse deployed abroad. Choose well friend... we\'re reading for two. The title selection can be anything - classic or contemporary literature non-fiction biographies... so long as both you and your loved one share in the experience. And if this little twist doesn\'t appeal to you... it\'s always cool to arrive stag your friendly neighborhood book club is always your best Plus One. Cheers!

Now the seven books of nonfiction that appeared between 1968 and 2003 have been brought together into one thrilling collection. Slouching Towards Bethlehem captures the counterculture of the sixties its mood and lifestyle as symbolized by California Joan Baez Haight-Ashbury. The White Album covers the revolutionary politics and the "contemporary wasteland" of the late sixties and early seventies in pieces on the Manson family the Black Panthers and Hollywood. Salvador is a riveting look at the social and political landscape of civil war. Miami exposes the secret role this largely Latin city played in the Cold War from the Bay of Pigs through Watergate. In After Henry Didion reports on the Reagans Patty Hearst and the Central Park jogger case. The eight essays in Political Fictions -on censorship in the media Gingrich Clinton Starr and "compassionate conservatism" among others-show us how we got to the political scene of today. And in Where I Was From Didion shows that California was never the land of the golden dream. Join us at Silk Elephant in Squirrel Hill for a lively discussion about the changing times of the 20th century from the perspective of one of the greatest contemporary writers.\xc2\xa0, Silk Elephant Restaurant, Pittsburgh, 1712 Murray Avenue, -79.922972, 40.437581

"Jeff Winston forty-three didn\'t know he was a replayer until he died and woke up twenty-five years younger in his college dorm room; he lived another life. And died again. And lived again and died again -- in a continuous twenty-five-year cycle -- each time starting from scratch at the age of eighteen to reclaim lost loves remedy past mistakes or make a fortune in the stock market. A novel of gripping adventure romance and fascinating speculation on the nature of time..."

He was an orthodox Jew who converted to Christianity. He is well versed in Hebrew and Yiddish this will help us to take apart a passage in the original language. I love to study this way it helps to understand what the original word was because in English it could have several meanings. FYI: this Bible study is televised on Channel 2 you will not be recorded if you wish not to be. There will be a time of fellowship after the Bible study so please stick around and talk for awhile., Green Pepper, Pittsburgh, 2020 Murray Ave, -79.923019, 40.434151

18289411, 3, South Hills Bible Study, This is a group that is committed to pursuing spiritual growth in the context of caring loving and authentic relationships. All are welcome to attend regardless of your religious beliefs or level of Bible knowledge. We meet in a home in Brentwood for a meal fellowship Bible discussion and prayer. Our group has a God-sized vision: We want to be used by God to facilitate a spiritual awakening in Pittsburgh.\xc2\xa0 Of course such an\xc2\xa0awakening is ultimately a work of God. He\'s the only One who\'s able to awaken people from their slumber and enable them to see the truth about spiritual matters.\xc2\xa0 Furthermore\xc2\xa0God\xc2\xa0primarily does this as people hear the gospel proclaimed. We believe that the gospel isn\'t just the "ABC\'s" of Christianity but rather the "A through Z."\xc2\xa0It\'s not just one class we take among many other classes. Instead it pervades the entire curriculum.\xc2\xa0 Therefore our vision is to see the gospel transform our city. This begins with experiencing progressively greater gospel transformation in our own lives and then\xc2\xa0seeing that spread to people around us until the entire city is renewed by the gospel.\xc2\xa0 What exactly does that look like? It looks like\xc2\xa0broken relationships being\xc2\xa0reconciled poverty being\xc2\xa0alleviated people experiencing\xc2\xa0freedom from the destructive impulses that dominate their lives and--most of all--people being\xc2\xa0forgiven for their sins and made right with God.\xc2\xa0 In other words we believe that the gospel is the solution for all the problems our city faces. Now it\'s great to talk about the gospel transforming our city but we also have to think about how that\'s going to happen. Of course as we discussed above it\xc2\xa0will ultimately happen by God\'s power as the Holy Spirit uses gospel proclamation to awaken those who are spiritually asleep.\xc2\xa0 However the entire church also has a vital role in all of this. Our role is to be the "city on a hill" that Jesus talked about in Mathew 5:14. And a central component of being a\xc2\xa0"city on a hill" is\xc2\xa0living in caring authentic and\xc2\xa0committed\xc2\xa0community with each other. Basically showing people what true love looks like. That\'s the most powerful and persuasive testimony for the truth of the gospel--Christians living out the gospel in community with each other.

The monthly assembly is our flagship event for celebrating together and nurturing a wider secular community.

They put the idea out to their community and got such an overwhelmingly positive response that the thing went a little bit viral with 30 assemblies popping up worldwide practically overnight. Since then the thing has gone way viral with about 80 new assemblies working to launch in September. \xe2\x80\x9cWell doesn\xe2\x80\x99t my city already have a dozen secular groups and a few Unitarian churches?\xe2\x80\x9d I hear you asking yourselves?

The intellectual and cerebral aspect of our average secular groups is very important and indispensable but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t often leverage the positive power of emotion music and poetry or just enjoying ourselves as a group.

The plan will involve a shuttle (if we have at least 3 people).\xc2\xa0 One person will stay to watch boats and gear.\xc2\xa0 All others will drive to the Freeport Takeout area (parking is along the road in Freeport).\xc2\xa0 We will then get into as few vehicles as possible to get all people back to Appollo PA (Roaring Run Access)\xc2\xa0where the paddling will begin.\xc2\xa0 The estimated drive time to Freeport is\xc2\xa025 minutes each way (which means starting to paddle at 6:50-7PM.\xc2\xa0 We will start in the daylight and hopefully (if it is not cloudy) see the sunset and moonrise.\xc2\xa0 The estimated paddling time is\xc2\xa04 hours on the water +-\xc2\xa030 min depending on current and how fast or slow the group wants to paddle.\xc2\xa0 Any rapids will be small class I or just faster water.\xc2\xa0 The last 4 miles are in the\xc2\xa0slack water of the Allegheny River\xc2\xa0with less current than the beginning of the trip.\xc2\xa0 We will need one person who\'s vehicle is at the takeout in Freeport to go back to\xc2\xa0Roaring Run Access Point/ Appolo to get the (person who watched boats at the beginning)\'s vehicle.\xc2\xa0 Others are free to leave when their boat are loaded as long as one person watches the remaining boat(s) from the people involved in the end shuttle. If\xc2\xa0only one other person besides\xc2\xa0me\xc2\xa0comes then\xc2\xa0we can go to\xc2\xa0Freeport and paddle a section of the Allegheny River\xc2\xa0out and back with no shuttle.\xc2\xa0 This is also the plan if the river is running extremely high- (flooded)\xc2\xa0or low. We\xc2\xa0will pass through the communities of\xc2\xa0Appolo\xc2\xa0North Vandergrift\xc2\xa0Hyde Park Leechburg West Leechburg Schenley and take out in Freeport.\xc2\xa0 On the way we\'ll pass under a walking bridge through wooded areas probably see a few trains running along the river and see the lights of the Allegheny Ludlum Bagdad plant.

I\xc2\xa0recommend bringing something to drink or a snack and an\xc2\xa0extra layer if it is going to be cold. bilge pumps paddle floats and othersafety equipment to get back in you boat\xc2\xa0are good to bring if you havethem.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t plan to tip but it has happened unexpectedly and I wasglad to have my pump.\xc2\xa0 It is also good to have a cell phone in a dry bagziplock or other water proof container just in case.\xc2\xa0 In the event of rain(not storms) this trip will still go- but you may want a spray skirt to keepyour boat dry.\xc2\xa0 A camera is nice but we may not get too many pictures in the dark- we can try.\xc2\xa0 (I don\'t think we\'ll be in water that is very deep so it should be possible to push your boat to shore standing or get back in on the water if you tip) This trip will run unless there islightening or thunder at launch time (or storms are predicted on the radar) toarrive during the time we will be on the water.\xc2\xa0 A low chance of stormsmay mean shortening the trip- or turning around if we hear thunder when on thewater.\xc2\xa0 If the weather is questionable please call me at[masked] tosee whether the trip is still on.\xc2\xa0 If the river is at flood stage orobviously unsafe due to recent torrential rains- this trip will becancelled or changed to the Allegheny River at Freeport.\xc2\xa0 I will not be able to see the conditions until I arrive around 5:30PM but if you have doubts- please call otherwise a decision will have to be made based on what we see upon arrival.

I think that\'s realistic.\xc2\xa0 Entry fees will pay 90% return with two winners - 54% goes to the winner of the zero-loss side 36% to the winner of the one-loss size 10% goes to the club. (to defray meetup costs) \xc2\xa0 Side pools will pay 100% return with 60% going to the farthest-advancing on the zero-loss side and 40% to the farthest-advancing on the one-loss side.

We are establishing administrations for\xc2\xa0common law grand juries in all 3144 counties in the United States of America. By doing this the people will move our courts back to \xe2\x80\x9cCourts of Justice\xe2\x80\x9d and take back 100% control of their government. THE DUTY OF THE COMMON LAW GRAND JURY is to right any wrong. If anyone\xe2\x80\x99s unalienable rights have been violated or removed without a legal sentence of their peers the grand jury can restore them. And if a dispute shall arise concerning this matter it shall be settled according to the judgment of the grand jurors the sureties of the peace. IN A US SUPREME COURT STUNNING 6 TO 3 DECISION JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA writing for the majority confirmed that the American grand jury is neither part of the judicial executive nor legislative branches of government but instead belongs to the people. It is in effect a fourth branch of government "governed" and administered to directly by and on behalf of the American people and its authority emanates from the Bill of Rights and has the power to enforce law and remove people from office. GRAND JURY BACKGROUND When the American colonies separated from England King\xc2\xa0George retaliated by revoking the charters. Technically the colonies were without any legal authority to operate. However civics (the branch of political philosophy concerned with individual rights) was generally taught and known by the people who asserted their rights and maintained order by applying the common law. The people united in the form of common law grand juries and continued the functioning of government. As the legislatures matured they slowly increased governmental power while simultaneously reducing personal sovereign power. This was done through a combination of passing pro-government legislation and reducing or eliminating education about civics. Today two and a quarter centuries later hardly anyone even knows the meaning of the word "civics." Despite the fact that the state and federal constitutions still acknowledge the common law as the ultimate law system people everywhere are conditioned to believe that the statutory law and codes are the only source of law. The only remaining common law term generally known among the public is "common law marriage." The common law grand jury is now dormant only because of the public ignorance of its powers that supersede all other government entities including the modern statutorily defined grand jury.

We are establishing administrations for\xc2\xa0common law grand juries in all 3144 counties in the United States of America. By doing this the people will move our courts back to \xe2\x80\x9cCourts of Justice\xe2\x80\x9d and take back 100% control of their government. THE DUTY OF THE COMMON LAW GRAND JURY is to right any wrong. If anyone\xe2\x80\x99s unalienable rights have been violated or removed without a legal sentence of their peers the grand jury can restore them. And if a dispute shall arise concerning this matter it shall be settled according to the judgment of the grand jurors the sureties of the peace. IN A US SUPREME COURT STUNNING 6 TO 3 DECISION JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA writing for the majority confirmed that the American grand jury is neither part of the judicial executive nor legislative branches of government but instead belongs to the people. It is in effect a fourth branch of government "governed" and administered to directly by and on behalf of the American people and its authority emanates from the Bill of Rights and has the power to enforce law and remove people from office. GRAND JURY BACKGROUND When the American colonies separated from England King\xc2\xa0George retaliated by revoking the charters. Technically the colonies were without any legal authority to operate. However civics (the branch of political philosophy concerned with individual rights) was generally taught and known by the people who asserted their rights and maintained order by applying the common law. The people united in the form of common law grand juries and continued the functioning of government. As the legislatures matured they slowly increased governmental power while simultaneously reducing personal sovereign power. This was done through a combination of passing pro-government legislation and reducing or eliminating education about civics. Today two and a quarter centuries later hardly anyone even knows the meaning of the word "civics." Despite the fact that the state and federal constitutions still acknowledge the common law as the ultimate law system people everywhere are conditioned to believe that the statutory law and codes are the only source of law. The only remaining common law term generally known among the public is "common law marriage." The common law grand jury is now dormant only because of the public ignorance of its powers that supersede all other government entities including the modern statutorily defined grand jury.

Kickoff Day - August 25th The start day of the season players are sent a kickoff email that contains important information about the league the link where your league standings and players contact information. We guarantee 6 playing partners at your playing level but have been averaging closer to 15+ partners in most cities. Your Task - "Flexible Scheduling"After this kickoff email is sent it is the player\'s task to communicate with other players. Players should work with their partners to find an agreeable time and location to play the match. While PittsburghTennisLeague doesn\'t mandate your playing schedule it is recommended that players schedule at least one match per week. By request of the players we started to allow players to play 1 rematch per season. The regular season is all about playing as much as you can.

This is a ~20 mins long guided meditation with the ultimate goal of achieving \xc2\xa0oneness with our Higher Self. It is based on the fact that certain energy centers in our system are entry points to certain levels of Divine Energy.\xc2\xa0 This meditation focuses on strengthening our divine connection through our Heart and Crown centers as they are the centers of love ... love for man and love for the divine.\xc2\xa0As we practice regularly we learn to love the Divine more through the love for mankind. The secret is in the Heart :) An interesting feature of this meditation is that as we expand our love centers we also become instruments of world service when we bless the Earth with Light Love and Power.\xc2\xa0 With regular practice we experience a holistic transformation as our energy system becomes more subtler and stronger. Though the meditation is only about 20 mins we give ourselves more time to meet and interact and learn from each others experiences. So please give yourselves about 2 hours for the event. Also you are welcome to donate to help cover cost of the event space! Looking forward to meeting you all !

3394792, 1, Strange Brew, Strange Brew - a beer sharing and tasting group \xc2\xa0 The purpose of this group is share craft beers that you might not normally have had a chance to try. We will each bring in a few brews and everyone will get samples until the bottles are empty. We don't want to bring standard beers that anyone can get everywhere. The idea is to bring in beers that are a little more unique: new releases seasonal special editions one-offs rare to Pittsburgh brews home brews or even beers that you pick up out of the area... that sort of thing.\xc2\xa0 This isn't meant as an exchange group as we will be drinking the brews at the\xc2\xa0meetups. \xc2\xa0 There are basically two sides to what could be brought to the meetups. The first would be beers that you would be able to buy in the area but are a little uncommon. Those would be the seasonal new releases special releases etc. It is possible that many people would not normally get a chance to try these brews either because they sell out or because people do not realize that these are available. Once we get a chance to try these beers we might be able to go out to find them and buy them for ourselves. This is nice because if you try something that you like you can keep an eye out and get more. \xc2\xa0 The other side would be beers that we would not be able to buy in the area. Those would be home brews and beers brought in from out of the area. Home brews are obviously not available anywhere except at the brewer\xe2\x80\x99s house. When I travel I like to stop in at bottleshops to see what they have available. I often find beers that I have never seen before and that I know are not available in Pittsburgh. This is nice because you would be able to try or share brews that we might never see again a unique experience. \xc2\xa0 We will be able to try each brew and discuss what we like or do not like about it. People\xc2\xa0who know a lot about beer will be able to share insight that others might not know and help educate those new to craft beers. People\xc2\xa0who are just getting into craft beers will be able to taste different styles. They will be able to hear what other like minded folk think about each and compare that to their own opinions. \xc2\xa0 Outside of not wanting commonly available brew brought in we are NOT going to be a snob minded group. People of all levels of experience and all levels of taste are welcome. The only way to get the Pittsburgh beer scene to grow is to have new people learn about craft beers. The only way to learn about beer is to try a variety. \xc2\xa0 If you like it drink it! \xc2\xa0 New Group Rules:  Bring some unique unusual or rare (for the area) beer for everyone to try.\xc2\xa0 Just 2 bottles of 12oz brews or 1 of larger bottles. Have a good time.

1029979, 1, The Campaign for Liberty: Pittsburgh, "Truth is treason in the empire of lies... There is an alternative to national bankruptcy a bigger police state trillion-dollar wars and a government that draws ever more parasitically on the productive energies of the American people. It\'s called freedom... If we want to live in a free society we need to break free from the artificial limitations on free debate and start asking serious questions once again. I am happy that my campaign for the presidency has finally raised some of them. But this is a long-term project that will persist far into the future. These ideas cannot be allowed to die buried beneath the mind-numbing chorus of empty slogans and inanities that constitute official political discourse in America." From The Revolution: A Manifesto by Ron Paul This Meetup Group is intended to serve the continuing Ron Paul Revolution specifically in the Pittsburgh and Western PA area. Regardless of the results of any one political campaign we will continue to follow the example and leadership of Dr. Ron Paul to bring about the restoration our liberties our Constitution and our cherished republic. We will take an active role in this endeavor.,Pittsburgh, government-politics, -79.9899978638, 40.4500007629, Right to Bear Arms; United States Constitution; Ron Paul; ,1029979, Allegheny County Common Law Grand Jury Reinstatement Committee Meeting\xe2\x80\x8f, 2015-08-04 23:00:00, ONLY THE PEOPLE CAN SAVE AMERICA - WILL YOU? We are establishing administrations for common law grand juries in all 3144 counties in the United States of America. By doing this the people will move our courts back to \xe2\x80\x9cCourts of Justice\xe2\x80\x9d and take back 100% control of their government. THE DUTY OF THE COMMON LAW GRAND JURY is to right any wrong. If anyone\xe2\x80\x99s unalienable rights have been violated or removed without a legal sentence of their peers the grand jury can restore them. And if a dispute shall arise concerning this matter it shall be settled according to the judgment of the grand jurors the sureties of the peace. IN A US SUPREME COURT STUNNING 6 TO 3 DECISION JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA writing for the majority confirmed that the American grand jury is neither part of the judicial executive nor legislative branches of government but instead belongs to the people. It is in effect a fourth branch of government "governed" and administered to directly by and on behalf of the American people and its authority emanates from the Bill of Rights and has the power to enforce law and remove people from office. GRAND JURY BACKGROUND When the American colonies separated from England King George retaliated by revoking the charters. Technically the colonies were without any legal authority to operate. However civics (the branch of political philosophy concerned with individual rights) was generally taught and known by the people who asserted their rights and maintained order by applying the common law. The people united in the form of common law grand juries and continued the functioning of government. As the legislatures matured they slowly increased governmental power while simultaneously reducing personal sovereign power. This was done through a combination of passing pro-government legislation and reducing or eliminating education about civics. Today two and a quarter centuries later hardly anyone even knows the meaning of the word "civics." Despite the fact that the state and federal constitutions still acknowledge the common law as the ultimate law system people everywhere are conditioned to believe that the statutory law and codes are the only source of law. The only remaining common law term generally known among the public is "common law marriage." The common law grand jury is now dormant only because of the public ignorance of its powers that supersede all other government entities including the modern statutorily defined grand jury.

Dynamic Business Rule Validation Across the Web Development Stack with Stefan Vantchev Whether you are a seasoned web developer or relatively new to the game I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you will agree that most software applications must continue to change over time along with the changes in the business requirements that the software is to support. In some applications these changes manifest from changes in laws or government regulations or maybe just from an aggressive new marketing strategy that requires the application to now support new sales strategies. In all instances the software applications we build must support these changes in business rules by setting new validation rules that must be evaluated through all layers. With increasing expectations of instantaneous response times we should be providing front end validation but we can\xe2\x80\x99t forget the importance of securing our APIs and of course the database. In this discussion we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about the tools we use to support dynamic business rule validation through AngularJS C# using Fluent Validators and SQL server. We are also very interested to know how others have tackled this issue in their applications so that we can all learn some new techniques together. About Stefan Vantchev Stefan Vantchev has been designing and developing software for over 14 years. His architectural and development background ranges from embedded software to enterprise-level SaaS and desktop applications to data-visualization solutions for a plethora of industries. Stefan has extensive experience with most of the iterations of the .Net framework with most recent interests including AngularJS WebAPI NoSql Dependency Injection and code modularization. When not serving as software architect at Mosaix Software Stefan volunteers at the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank and the Waldorf School of Pittsburgh.

DIRECTIONS:\xc2\xa0The simplest approach is beginning from the PA 18 exit (Exit 12) on PA 60 proceed north on PA 18 for 3.1 miles to the Rochester Bridge. Immediately after crossing the bridge turn right at the traffic light onto Pleasant Street. At the bottom of the hill in 0.2 miles you come to a complicated six-way intersection. Turn onto first right \xe2\x80\x94 New York Avenue (which is at a 90-degree angle from the road you are on \xe2\x80\x94 there is a white sign here that says "Rochester Riverfront Park" as well as a few other things) and proceed over bridge that bends to the right. After 0.25 mile turn left at the stop sign onto Harrison Street. The Ohio River and Riverfront Park are ahead at the next stop sign (0.1 mile). Turn right on Water Street; the road runs along the Ohio briefly then turns north and parallels the Beaver River for about 0.7 mile before terminating in a parking circle. \xc2\xa0We don\'t plan on anything fancy. \xc2\xa0Vicky Kennedy and I will provide hamburgers and hot dogs with buns. \xc2\xa0Veggie burgers will also be available. \xc2\xa0 Volunteers to bring other picnic foods would be very appreciated. \xc2\xa0Vicky will be coordinating the food and drink. \xc2\xa0If you would be willing to contribute food or a monetary donation please contact Vicky Kennedy [masked] \xc2\xa0or call[masked] For this meeting I need to limit it to members. \xc2\xa0If our group continues to grow I\'d like to include family members next time.

16204522, 1, Pittsburgh Christian Apologetics Group, This is a group for people interested in Christian Apologetics. Please see our new website. http://ukranians2.wix.com/pgh-apologetics-c...   What is Apologetics you may ask? Apologetics: \xe2\x80\x9cThat aspect of Christian theology which seeks to set out and demonstrate the credibility and plausibility of the Christian Faith\xe2\x80\x9d (Alister McGrath in The J.I. Packer Collection). Apologetics is about analyzing and defending what Christians believe why they believe it and asking whether or not Christianity is true and makes logical sense. Its okay to ask the tough questions all is fair game. Every evangelist should be an apologist. The evangelist shares the gospel with people and the apologist tries to convince people that the gospel is true and real.   Apologetics is as old as the Bible and ancient Greek philosophers. The word itself was made famous in the book of  1 Peter. "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an apologia to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear"    Apologetics is about taking an honest look at Christianity and asking "Is this stuff real?" "Did Jesus really exist?" "Is there any historic logical philosophic and scientific merit to Christianity?" Its Christianity for the deep and thinking person. Its Christianity for the skeptic and agnostic. In the end the skeptic may or may not become a believer that is their choice. But at least the facts are clearly analyzed and presented. Take a look at this 2 minute video for an excellent explanation.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAFlmuiA-eE    What will this meetup group do and accomplish?   This group is for discussion and debate about religion and Christianity and also a book club for apologetics authors such as: Ravi Zacharias JP Moreland Alister McGrath John Lennox Os Guinness William Lane Craig Phil Fernandez CS Lewis and anyone from the Veritas forum or any other apologetics author/speaker people are interested in.   Books by skeptics and atheists will also be read in order to give an honest analysis to their claims and to compare to the claims of apologists. We will also try and attend debates and Q/A forums at Universities all over the country. Sadly most of these are not in Pittsburgh. Watch this video for an example of such a Q/A session. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8XSa79sU0M Basically we watch a difficult video or read a difficult book that challenges Christianity and we try our best to refute it using apologetics books and materials logic common sense and most importantly the Bible. We talk a lot. Its mostly about discussion. If you want to listen thats fine too.   Who should join this group? If you are interested in the Historic Jesus and Historic Christianity philosophy religion in general or you are a Christian who is either struggling with their faith or is strong in their faith but wants a deep and serious philosophic discussion about Christianity. Also if you are a believer in another religion or faith or agnostic or atheist and would like to discuss Christianity or religion in general.  Christians people of non-Christian faiths skeptics and atheists are all welcome!!!   So what makes me qualified to run this group?   This type of discussion is usually done at the University level in Philosophy courses. I do not claim to be an expert in the area of Apologetics my field of study is in Science and Engineering actually. In fact I\'m just a guy in my late 20\'s working for a tech company not a University professor.   But I have been a fan of apologetics authors and have been listening to debates between Theists and Non-Theists and people of different faiths for years now. Its something which helps me a lot in my own faith. I\'m a student of apologetics and Christianity like everyone else in the group.   In fact our group currently consists of a few University Philosophy professors and pastors that have a lot more knowledge and experience than I do. The biggest thing I contribute is passion and enthusiasm for the subject of apologetics and the willingness to learn from others. I am always open to advice and everything in this group is 100% democratic. Everything we do is a group effort and everyone has a say in everything.   When and where do we meet? We meet in the Squirrel Hill library community room. Sometimes its a Panera Bread instead depending on community room availability. As of right now we either meet in the Squirrel Hill library or in the Shadyside Panera Bread.   We meet once a month. The meetings are 2 hours long and usually on Saturday at 11am. We usually have some assignment to complete before each meeting such as watch a video read part of a book read an article etc. During the meetings we discuss the assignment watch videos have formal debates between theists and atheists and just talk about the subject of the assignment.

Thank you for coming and for the support!  What we will do during this meeting Beginning with this meeting we will be starting something new. We will begin watching \xc2\xa0Theist Vs. Atheist debates of the most famous philosophers and apologists of today and discussing afterwards.\xc2\xa0 Most of these debates are very long. Usually around 2 hours. We will split the debates up into approximately 4 sections and it will take 4 meeting to get through each debate.\xc2\xa0 This will all lead up to the talk by Ravi Zacharias in October at CMU and Pitt which we will attend as a club.\xc2\xa0 The topic Since we have been talking about free will and the problem of evil during the past few meetings we will continue the topic by seeing how two famous philosophers William Lane Craig and Sam Harris handle the question of "Is God Good?" Below is a link to the video we will watch. Watch until approximately 30 minutes. This is what we will cover during the meeting. I still need to figure out a proper stopping place such that both speakers had a turn before we discuss. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwcZNWd3iSo    The Rules http://ukranians2.wix.com/pgh-apologetics-club#!meetup-group/cwzz We had some problems during past meetings because people failed to follow the rules. People got offended. Remember these are challenging topics. Why don\'t you discuss religion and politics at the dinner table? Because it causes WW3 among your family members. This is a club where we discuss those topics and try to be civil about it.\xc2\xa0 People have different opinions and the only way we will get anywhere is if we respect each other and give each other a fair hearing and\xc2\xa0DO NOT\xc2\xa0talk over someone else while they are speaking. Everyone has the same amount of time to speak and no talking over other people. These are the main rules.\xc2\xa0 Lets have fun and learn something together!\xc2\xa0, Squirrel Hill Library , Pittsburgh, 5801 Forbes Ave., -79.922531, 40.438118

9759622, 1, Biophilia: Pittsburgh, Biophilia: Pittsburgh is the pilot chapter for a global Biophilia Network of creative minds dedicated to strengthening the bond between people and the natural world through education discussion and action. Click here to access materials from our past meetings. Our Goals   \xe2\x80\xa2 To welcome and inspire others with the concept and principles of biophilia   \xe2\x80\xa2 To foster collaboration and learning between professionals from a wide variety of disciplines   \xe2\x80\xa2 To communicate biophilic principles in action-oriented ways to a wider audience for exponential and regional impact \xc2\xa0 What Is Biophilia? The term \xe2\x80\x9cbiophilia\xe2\x80\x9d which literally means \xe2\x80\x9clove of life\xe2\x80\x9d was coined by social psychologist Erich Fromm and popularized by biologist E.O. Wilson who defined it as \xe2\x80\x9cthe innately emotional affiliation of human beings to other living organisms.\xe2\x80\x9d The implications of biophilia extend across a vast array of disciplines including design and engineering nutrition psychology public health education biology and the humanities. Biophilia is expressed all over the world every day through complex collaborations such as the design and construction of buildings and landscapes; and intimate personal encounters including nature hikes and home gardening. \xc2\xa0 What Will We Do? It all starts with good conversation! Biophilia: Pittsburgh will begin by meeting monthly at the Center for Sustainable Landscapes classroom at Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens. Over delicious small-plates and light refreshments a discipline or behavior will be identified \xe2\x80\x94 often by an expert guest speaker \xe2\x80\x94 and discussed among the participants in the interest of sharing ideas and identifying opportunities. With your direction we hope to expand the schedule to include off-site trips to biophilic regional destinations like nature preserves green buildings and urban gardens and to plan and enact initiatives in our own community to make things better for people and the planet.

Perhaps more than any other natural history subjects birds help connect people with nature and ornithology has a long history of contribution by citizen scientists. In 2013 Mulvihill brought the Smithsonian Institution\'s Neighborhood Nestwatch project to Pittsburgh.

Piacentini. Mulvihill will talk about this and the National Aviary\'s other research and conservation projects. Robert S. Mulvihill is a native Pittsburgher who has been an active member of the birding and bird conservation community for more than thirty years. He received a B.S. in Education from the University of Pittsburgh and an M.S. in Biology from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Mulvihill began his ornithological career at Powdermill Nature Reserve the biological field station of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History where he served as a field ornithologist at the world renowned Powdermill bird banding station.

18288294, 1, Remembering the First World War, Many historians and others consider World War I to be the most significant event of the 20th century. Its influence continues to echo through modern life and culture.   I have always been fascinated by the Great War and its aftermath. I am not an academic or historian but an amateur scholar who would like to learn more about the events and outcomes of the war. As the world observes the centenary of the war this is a good time to find others with similar interests.   The structure of this group will be determined somewhat by the members.  I see this primarily as a study/discussion group but we can expand to other activities (more on that below).   To get started we\'ll have a reading/viewing list of books websites and films to get us all at the same starting point.  Then we can explore more areas - perhaps the flu pandemic the Christmas Truce portrayals in popular culture (WWI in Doctor Who anyone?) etc.   "Other activities" could include watching a film or documentary as a group having a WWI-era dinner listening to/performing the poetry and music inspired by the war sharing personal family histories and so on.  A major project I am planning is a staged multidisciplinary performance featuring historical narrative readings from letters home period music and poetry.  Participation in this project is welcome.   This will be not just a military history but an exploration of the war\'s social cultural and artistic heritage. Meeting times locations and frequency are all TBD. East End/east suburb locations are my preference but other areas can be considered based on where people live and work.   People at all levels of interest are encouraged to join - from novices to professional historians. PLEASE NOTE For logistical and financial purposes our group currently has a cap of 50 members.  However anyone who is interested can attend our events.  Non-members can PM the Organizer (Jeannine aka pghwelshgirl) via Meetup to inquire about specific events.  Members who are inactive for extended periods will be asked to relinquish their membership so that new members may join.  Prior members are still free to take part in events though as described above. If the group becomes more active with more regular events and higher attendance we will remove the cap.  In that event however members will be asked to pay a small amount (a few dollars a year) toward the administrative costs of the group.,Pittsburgh, literature-writing, -79.8899993896, 40.4300003052, Poetry; Watching Movies; Book Club; Museum; History; Intellectual Discussion; Reading; Novel Reading; International Travel; Historic Buildings; Historic Locations and People; local history; World War I; English & British culture/history/literature; ,18288294, FINALLY! "Testament of Youth" at Harris Theater, 2015-08-01 23:30:00, Good news! I\'ve still been checking upcoming films at local theaters. As I\'d hoped Pittsburgh Filmmakers has scheduled Testament of Youth for the first week in August. Timing isn\'t ideal as it\'s only a week after our visit to Soldiers &amp; Sailors. But c\'est la guerre! Also these schedules are always subject to change. I don\'t think Filmmakers will pull it but they could possibly reschedule for later in August if an earlier film is held over. If that happens I\'ll update the details here ASAP. I\'ve scheduled this for Saturday August 1.\xc2\xa0 Showtimes have not been announced yet so the 8:00 pm time is tentative. According to the Filmmakers website admission to the Harris is $8.00. Here\'s the link to Pittsburgh Filmmakers description of the film. And here (again!) is the film\'s website which includes the trailer. Although there are events at Heinz Hall Benedum and Theater Square that evening the Pirates are out of town. Parking shouldn\'t be too challenging.Here\'s a map of downtown garages For now I\'m scheduling this for the film only. I may add on an optional drink-before nearby once the showtime is known. Thanks! Jeannine ===================================================== JULY 30 UPDATE Basically same info as in comment below: I looked for a bar/restaurant near the Harris but didn\'t see one on the maps that looked close enough. So for those who\'d like to meet to socialize a bit before the film I\'ll be at Crazy Mocha\'s just a few doors away from the Harris Theater starting at 6 pm: 801 Liberty AvenuePittsburgh PA  If you\'re interested drop in when you can.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have Meetup signs up at our tables. We\'ll walk over to the Harris at 7 pm.\xc2\xa0 If you\'re just going to the film please meet us in the lobby by 7:10 pm. For all info re: the film the Harris and parking see the links above. Not too late to RSVP - or bring a friend!. I am following up this announcement with an email. My cell phone for calls/messages/texts is[masked]-6848. See every one Saturday!

It has a lot of great things to offer. However when I talk with people about it there are a number of misconceptions. I'd like to dispel some based on what I've learned using kanban for the last 3 years. I'm hoping folks in the audience will share their experiences as well - kanban practitioners are encouraged to attend! Michael's Bio:I started out in engineering back in the mid \xe2\x80\x9890s programming aircraft engine models. I quickly learned I like to build cool stuff but I also like to be lazy. With software I can do both! So in \xe2\x80\x9899 I made the switch and became a software developer. Along the way I realized it isn\xe2\x80\x99t all about heads-down coding - the overall process is important. My agile journey began in the early \xe2\x80\x9800s when I picked up some engineering practices from XP. Then I had to lead teams so I learned Scrum. I\xe2\x80\x99ve since introduced Scrum to a number of clients. Scrum worked well but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t always feel like the right fit. I learned about lean and kanban and transitioned a team to ScrumBan and eventually full kanban. I\xe2\x80\x99ve played multiple roles on my journey - developer tester project manager program manager and architect. And I truly enjoy all of them (well maybe not testing so much) because they all get me to my desired end state - building cool stuff., Innovu LLC, Pittsburgh, 100 West Station Square Dr. Suite 500 (Landmarks Building), -80.003815, 40.433418

Also I am proposing grabbing an adult beverage or two after our sketching at 8:30.There is no shortage of watering holes. I tried to look at bus info... but all that I can tell anyone is that PAT and Westmoreland Transit have routes that come through Irwin but I'm not sure of the times. Irwin Main St. and Pennsylvania Ave would be the ideal stop. Any bus traveling from Pittsburgh to Latrobe Mt. Pleasant and/or Greensburg should pass by that stop.

1400108, 1, Veterans and Patriots United, Are you disgusted with the direction our Government is going?  Is this the America you have known?  Do you fear that your children and future generations will never have the opportunities that we have had?  If you agree with us join us in a grass roots movement to stop the insane direction of this government and return our country to its Constitutional Principles.  We know that it is hard to spend the time to be politically active when you are busy working and supporting your family.  It is easy to demonstrate and be politically active when you don't have a job and your goal is to get something for nothing or when ACORN is paying you money to show up and demonstrate. Consequently we are at a distinct disadvantage with other political organizations.  However we can all see where our lack of participation has gotten us.  No matter how difficult it may be we must stand up for our belief in our country and our Constitution before it is too late.   We will be having our Veterans and Patriots United monthly meetings on the last Wednesday of every month at 7:00pm.  We have agreed to limit the meeting to two hours.  We are experimenting with a new location for the meetings so please pay attention to the location when planning to attend. Our group spent our original (9) months educating ourselves and creating our political platform to accurately describe the type of candidates we would like to support in order to bring this country back to its Constitutional roots.  Our political platform is our Group&rsquo;s defining document and you can view it by clicking on the &ldquo;FILES&rdquo; section of this site.  Take the time to read it and understand it and you will clearly see how far our country has strayed from what the Founding Fathers had envisioned and how blatantly the Constitution has been violated. Our future meetings will be dedicated to education and taking positive steps in order to get candidates elected that agree with our political platform.  We will listen to candidates speak and determine how best to support those candidates that we believe will most closely reflect our political platform.  Without the public&rsquo;s support we will not be successful.  Please attend our meetings and become a member.  Pass the word and make a difference.  Do it for your family your children and future generations.  We only ask for a committment of two hours a month to attend our monthly meetings.  Is two hours a month too much to ask in order to try your best to make a difference and get this country headed back in the right direction? Please help us!

18680854, 1, Pittsburgh Functional Programming Meetup, I'm probably not moving to London or the Bay Area. Is it possible to be a professional Haskell programmer in Pittsburgh? Wouldn't it be nice to have a day job slinging Erlang or Elixir?. How about getting paid to hack Clojure? Maybe your dream job is coding Common Lisp or OCaml. Is there anything we can do to promote functional programming in our town? Can we be a little less passive? If there was a visible functional community in the area could that help to create possibilities? With the possible exception of the multi-paradigm language Scala I'm not sure there is a single functional programming language that's in wide enough commercial use here in Pittsburgh to support a significant work force. Likewise potential employers might be averse to adopting FP for lack of a pool  of such developers from which to draw. But perhaps all functional languages taken together as a whole could provide a suitable foundation. It's a concurrent and polyglot world now and our industry needs what the functional paradigm has to offer. The hope is that such a community could lower the barriers to adoption of functional languages for both employers and developers in our area.,Pittsburgh, tech, -79.9499969482, 40.4700012207, Lisp & Scheme; Programming Languages; Scala; Haskell; Functional Programming; Clojure; Erlang Programming; F# Programming; Concurrent Programming; Category Theory; OCaml Programming; ClojureScript; Elixir Programming; PureScript; ,18680854, August Meetup, 2015-08-05 23:00:00, First Wednesday of each month., IBM Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh, 1710 Murray Avenue, -79.92305, 40.437515
