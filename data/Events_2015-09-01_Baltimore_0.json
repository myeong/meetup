The population was 1,134 at the 2000 census. A charming, bayside gem nestled on the beautiful Eastern Shore of Virginia.<\/p> <p><br\/>Located on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay, Cape Charles continues to recapture its 1880s glory days when the railroad gave birth to this post-Victorian beauty.<br\/>Around the 1880\u2019s, it became a bustling town as patronage flourished from the newly established railroad business (the rails were extended from Pocomoke, Maryland in 1884). Then, Cape Charles hosted daily trains from New York, multiple passenger steamer boats, and was a loading point for cargo headed over the 36-mile Chesapeake Bay waters to Norfolk, Virginia.<\/p> <p>The town thrived through the booming railroad age, through World War II ferrying supplies and troops, and was even popular through the 1950\u2019s as a popular auto ferry until the ferry was moved to Kiptopeke, to the south. With the opening of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel in 1964, and the decline of railroad transit, the town experienced an economic downturn, as cargo trucks became the main shipping method.<\/p> <p>We can dine together at the Shanty or the Aqua Restaurant for lunch. If you get sucked in to the relaxed atmosphere and desire to stay one night, consider the Hotel Cape Charles, designed around the small-town warmth of Cape Charles.<br\/>Estimated: 198 miles<br\/>Travel Time (excluding gas stops) 3 hrs 20 mins.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/c\/4\/600_432619396.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>NOTE: dates may change.<\/p>",

We will also spend a little time paddling on the river and the Chesapeake Bay. This is a beautiful area where you would never know that you are just a short distance from major highways and rail lines. There is marsh and woodland and abundant wildlife. Bring a snack, sunscreen, hat and plenty of water along with appropriate safety gear. ALL PADDLERS MUST WEAR PFDs AND BE ABLE TO PERFORM A WET EXIT.<\/p> <p>Afterwards, we will head to the nearby historic town of Port Deposit for a refreshing meal at Lee's Landing Dock Bar.<\/p> <p><b>Kayaking involves known and unanticipated risks which may include, but are not limited to, pain, suffering, physical injury, death and economic or emotional loss, which participants may suffer during, or travelling to and from this activity.

To that end, I\u2019ll need folks to pre-pay so that I can prepare for you to just come hungry and ready to play!\u00a0 You need not bring a thing (unless it's games, of course!)\u00a0The cost\u00a0$8 a person\u00a0covers everything:\u00a0burgers, hot dogs, grilled chicken breasts, buns, condiments, side dishes, desserts,\u00a0non-alcoholic drinks, and paper products. We've done it this way for the past 2 years and it seems to greatly simplify things :-) You just show up hungry!\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>Pre-payment is required in order to r.s.v.p. and we\u2019ll close the window for responding on July 28th. This is to allow sufficient time to purchase and prepare the food. Refunds will be given, should you change your mind about attending---as long as you change your r.s.v.p. by the 28th! Refunds will also be given should we get rained out.<br\/>Above and beyond food, I have lots of board games and a croquet set. You are welcome to bring your own games and alcoholic beverages\u2014if you are so inclined. This is a family friendly event, but please be sure to bring appropriate games\/activities\u00a0IF you are bringing children.<\/p>",

Tze\u2019ec which means \u2018One Who Dwells in Both Realms\u2019 was given this name because of his unique ability to understand the relationship between the physical and spiritual realms.<\/p> <p>Tze\u2019ec has combined his ancestry and love of the Mayan culture with his love of dance and music. He has danced professionally with the Ballet Folklorico and the Baile Aztlan of Mexico, and his music is featured in the Imax film Alaska on various indigenous albums and collections from around the world. In 1993 he ecorded his prayers and journeys in the Yucatec dialect on his first album\/CD Mayan Dream. Tze\u2019ec has lectured at the University of Indiana, University of Akron, Kansas State University, Youngstown University, taught classes in Colorado University and Naropa College.<\/p> <p>Join us for an evening of insight and experience into Mayan Mysticism.<\/p>",

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\". That way, we know not to be waiting for you. Thanks.<\/b><\/p> <p>So come join us on Sunday for a brisk walk in the park. It's a great way to clean out the cobwebs and start a Sunday.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

Or $75 seasonal per car, good for all state parks. 5120 South Street, Baltimore, MD 21227 GPS gets you to the park entrance. After turning in the park entrance, please pay the entrance fee at the booth. Continue straight ahead (for about 1.5 miles) and when you reach the intersection, take a LEFT (there is not an option to go forward, you can only turn LEFT or right).

We will view this documentary and then discuss the main question that it raises: Why are there so many churches yet so many problems in African American communities? African Americans are considered by sociologists and demographers to be the most religious ethic group in the United States, but is also a group impacted by many social and economic problems. This discrepancy underscores the ineffectuality of religion and the futility of faith in Black America.<\/p>",

In vivid poems, she shares what it was like to grow up as an African American in the 1960s and 1970s, living with the remnants of Jim Crow and her growing awareness of the Civil Rights movement. Touching and powerful, each poem is both accessible and emotionally charged, each line a glimpse into a child\u2019s soul as she searches for her place in the world. Woodson\u2019s eloquent poetry also reflects the joy of finding her voice through writing stories, despite the fact that she struggled with reading as a child. Her love of stories inspired her and stayed with her, creating the first sparks of the gifted writer she was to become.<\/p>",

Any money raised will go towards next quarters Meet-up fees. Please bring cash in small denominations. \u00a0Let's have an evening of good food, lively conversation, and great company.

        "description": "<p>Dear yogis,<\/p> <p>We invite you on an exciting journey\u00a0 exploring the path of Bhakti Yoga, the yoga of love and devotion.<\/p> <p><br\/>We live in an age which grants us extraordinary conveniences and torrents of information. Yet\u00a0 the very technology designed for our well-being often serves only to isolate us from one another and distance us from the experience of all that is truly divine.<\/p> <p><br\/>The Bhakti Lounge is a place where incredible transformation and healing takes place all through the culture of bhakti. Meditation, Kirtan, Discussions on the Bhagavad Gita and other ancient texts from the Vedic tradition , Vegetarian food prepared using Bhakti &amp; Ayurvedic principles create an environment where lifelong friendships are made. As one yogi remarked\" I finally found a\u00a0 community of kindred spirits\"<\/p> <p><br\/>We meet every Sunday on 200 Bloomsbury Avenue Catonsville, MD from 6 pm to 8 pm. Please join us to create a sacred circle of love and devotion and bring bliss\/ananda in the Baltimore region and beyond.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nHope to see you soon!<\/p>",

The four-season resort, located in Garrett County, Maryland, offers a wide range of activities such as boating, fishing, camping, swimming, hiking, bicycling, and horseback riding in the summer. (Skiing, snowboarding, snowtubing, and snowmobiling during the winter months.) A short 3-hour drive takes you from hustle bustle metro life to Deep Creek Lake - one of the best kept secrets for a relaxing, local getaway escape!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/e\/9\/600_435407849.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The outdoor activities are pretty much limitless at Deep Creek, but most folks of course opt for lake activities such as boating, kayaking and swimming. Rent a pontoon boat, ski boat or wave runner and tour around the lake... or better yet, to a local bar (yes, via boat!). The area has state parks with scenic hiking trails to some very cool waterfalls. Bring your bike and try out part of the bike course for the famous SavageMan Triathlon that Deep Creek hosts. Or take it down a notch and visit the local shops, restaurants &amp; bars, and even explore \"downtown\" - walk the streets and check out the stores and eateries. Or go into total relaxation mode and grab a chair and a drink and just relax lakeside or at an outdoor bar... and perhaps venture down the road to enjoy some summer treats at the fudgery, popcorn poppery, and the best ice cream ever at Lakeside Creamery.<\/p> <p>We have lakefront accommodations right on the water's edge! Wake up and walk out back and enjoy beautiful views of the lake and mountains. Go for a swim in this freshwater lake or grab one of the kayaks that are on the property for hourly rental. We will also have a pontoon boat for the group to go out on... info on how to reserve your spot coming soon.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/f\/0\/600_435407856.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Our small, waterfront hotel is a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence Winner for the last two years in a row and is newly renovated. There are 20 guest rooms, which have either 1 King bed, 2 Queen beds, or a 1 Queen bed. Rooms feature hardwood bamboo flooring and neutral finishes with fresh white linens and comforters; and the furniture within each room was designed and built by a local artisan from reclaimed barn wood.\u00a0 All rooms equipped with a mini-fridge and microwave, and have a covered balcony with clear lake and mountain views.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/f\/f\/600_435407871.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>You can opt to stay 2 nights (Fri &amp; Sat) or just 1 night (Sat)...whatever works best for you.<\/p> <p>For now, just RSVP and Save the Date - Aug 28-30! I know people tend to book up their summers early... so just wanted to get this on folk's calendars before other events &amp; trips get scheduled on this weekend.<\/p> <p>When the date gets closer, I'll send out a message about pricing (based on single and double occupancy) and when a deposit is due to hold your spot. And we can start to coordinate rides and such.<\/p> <p><b>**Paying a deposit will be required to confirm your reservation on the Deep Creek Lake weekend getaway.**<\/b><\/p> <p>More to come... stay tuned.<\/p> <p>Hope you can join us for this fun lake vacation!\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>This is a combined meetup for the Washington DC Gen X Travel Club and Baltimore Gen X Travel Club.<\/i><\/p>",

If you can bring a core game please list that with your RSVP so we can expand the number of player seats.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Adventure 0-2 - A Pirate's Life<\/b><\/p> <p>Yo ho! A pirate\u2019s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\u2019s more to a pirate\u2019s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\u2019s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate\u2019s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\u2019s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.<\/p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that\u2019s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there\u2019s power, there\u2019s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play, as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we are sure we have space for, but if there is more interest, we can almost certainly make more room. So please sign up for the wait list if you want to play.<\/p> <p>3.

If\u00a0you drive and find parking difficult, try the 1200 block of Bank Street for free street parking. \u00a0Also, the Little Italy Garage is inexpensive and safe. \u00a0It's between Central, Exeter, and Bank streets.\u00a0<\/p> <p>P.P.S.\u00a0Though we meet at the Under Armour Brand Store, we are not affiliated with Under Armour.\u00a0<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Hi all! Here's our book for July. Hope you enjoy!<\/p> <p><i>The New York Times bestseller and the USA Today #1 Hot Fiction Pick for the summer, The Chaperone is a captivating novel about the woman who chaperoned an irreverent Louise Brooks to New York City in 1922 and the summer that would change them both.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p>Only a few years before becoming a famous silent-film star and an icon of her generation, a fifteen-year-old Louise Brooks leaves Wichita, Kansas, to study with the prestigious Denishawn School of Dancing in New York. Much to her annoyance, she is accompanied by a thirty-six-year-old chaperone, who is neither mother nor friend.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Cora Carlisle, a complicated but traditional woman with her own reasons for making the trip, has no idea what she\u2019s in for. Young Louise, already stunningly beautiful and sporting her famous black bob with blunt bangs, is known for her arrogance and her lack of respect for convention. Ultimately, the five weeks they spend together will transform their lives forever. For Cora, the city holds the promise of discovery that might answer the question at the core of her being, and even as she does her best to watch over Louise in this strange and bustling place she embarks on a mission of her own. And while what she finds isn\u2019t what she anticipated, she is liberated in a way she could not have imagined.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Over the course of Cora\u2019s relationship with Louise, her eyes are opened to the promise of the twentieth century and a new understanding of the possibilities for being fully alive. Drawing on the rich history of the 1920s,\u201930s, and beyond\u2014from the orphan trains to Prohibition, flappers, and the onset of the Great Depression to the burgeoning movement for equal rights and new opportunities for women<\/p> <p>\u2014Laura Moriarty\u2019s The Chaperone illustrates how rapidly everything, from fashion and hemlines to values and attitudes, was changing at this time and what a vast difference it all made for Louise Brooks, Cora Carlisle, and others like them.<\/p>",

This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>",

FUN!<\/p> <p>However, since each workout program is intentionally different to alleviate boredom and to give you maximum results in minimum time its difficult to describe a \"typical day.\" You can expect some light running, resistance training, obstacle courses, core, body weight, and team training. On some days, you will hike, crawl, lunge, and have a fun time while burning a ton of fat and meeting new people. It's always an adventure! These 1 hour workouts are design to provide a total body workout, in half the time!<\/p> <p>Can wait to see you at the next session!<\/p>",

I suggest bringing a yoga mat for floor exercises, but if you don't have one..don't worry we'll improvise!<\/p> <p>What are classes like?<br\/>Classes are taught to beginner's level, with variations for more advanced students. All movements and combinations are broken down to their basic components and explained. The first half of class focuses on basic technique and isolations to prepare the body for the specific movements that are part of the choreography work on in the end. The end of class is where we work on a choreographed piece. Expect to dance the entire time, work up a good sweat, get a good workout, and learn a little something new almost every class.<\/p> <p>Will this class help me tone up?<br\/>It sure will!

We'll be writing layout and positioning logic from scratch and discussing the limitations of using pre-existing systems, such as Twitter Bootstrap.<\/p> <p>The course will be equal parts design and development and will address the interplay between the two. Throughout the four weeks, students will each design and build a fully responsive site with content provided by the instructor.<\/p> <p><b>Class dates:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>- Aug 4, 6:15-8:30pm<\/p> <p><br\/>- Aug 11, 6:15-8:30pm<\/p> <p>- Aug 18, 6:15-8:30pm<\/p> <p>- Aug 25, 6:15-8:30pm<\/p> <p><br\/>Class will begin at 6:30pm promptly. Please arrive at 6:15pm to give yourself time to grab a seat and set up your laptop.<\/p> <p><i>Due to the restrictions of Meetup's registration, we can't schedule multi-day events, so keep in mind that this Meetup event serves as registration for the entire course.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Requirements:<\/b><\/p> <p>- A basic understanding of HTML and CSS (experience with a CSS preprocessor such as LESS or Sass will also be valuable but is not required)<\/p> <p>- A code editor; we recommend Sublime Text (learn more and download here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sublimetext.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sublimetext.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.sublimetext.com\/<\/a><\/a>)<\/p> <p>- Google Chrome web browser<\/p> <p><br\/>Also, all GDI events require that all participants--students, teachers, TAs, organizers, etc.--abide by our Code of Conduct:<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.girldevelopit.com\/code-of-conduct\"><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.girldevelopit.com\/code-of-conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.girldevelopit.com\/code-of-conduct<\/a><\/b><\/a><\/p> <p><b>About the teacher: <\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/e\/2\/6\/600_439552774.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i><b>Andy Mangold <\/b><\/i>is a designer, front-end developer, and one of the co-founders of <a href=\"http:\/\/friendsoftheweb.com\/\">Friends of The Web<\/a>.

        "description": "<p><b>What:<\/b> This is an open ongoing mindfulness meditation group for both beginners and experienced practitioners.<\/p> <p>While the forms of meditation we practice are rooted in Buddhist teachings, the study and practice of mindfulness and insight meditation is applicable to anyone from any background or religion, and all are welcome.<\/p> <p>These teachings are available to all. Although a <b>$5-$10 donation is suggested<\/b>, donations are not required for attendance. Each class will include: guided meditation, instruction, opportunities to practice, and time for discussion, questions and answers.<\/p> <p><b>When and where:<\/b> We meet <b>every Tuesday from 7:00-8:30 p.m<\/b>. at <b>Baltimore Yoga Village in the Mount Washington<\/b> area of Baltimore. Please arrive early to settle into your seats - we start right at 7:00 p.m.<\/p> <p>We practice Insight Meditation, a style of meditation that helps the mind attain deeper levels of calm concentration through sustained attention on the breath, then combines this with the crucial aspect of insight through contemplation of the mind and body and all of their changing and impermanent senses, emotions and thoughts. Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teaching Schedule:<\/b><\/p> <p>6\/23 Mira\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 6\/30 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>7\/7\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7\/14\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07\/21\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7\/28\u00a0 Stan<\/p> <p>8\/4\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8\/11\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a08\/18\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8\/25\u00a0\u00a0Stan<\/p> <p><b>Teachers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a former high school physics teacher who has been meditating for\u00a030 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.

On some days, you will hike, crawl, lunge, and have a fun time while burning a ton of fat and meeting new people. It's always an adventure! These 1 hour workouts are design to provide a total body workout, in half the time!<\/p> <p>Can wait to see you at the next session!<\/p>",

Fortunately, that same author provides a brilliant, easy to understand blueprint on how to significantly reduce the likelihood of being one of these statistics. Join EE on Wednesday, August 5, when Michael Sanders of NEXPHASE Inventory Management covers the details of Michael Gerber\u2019s extraordinary work and learn how to flip the odds\u2026..in our favor!<\/p> <p>Each attendee of the August luncheon will also receive a copy of The E-Myth Revisited, courtesy of Steve Hall of Maryland Sales Training and Management Development.<\/p> <p>About Michael Sanders<\/p> <p>Michael Sanders is a senior business executive with twenty eight years of experience in administrative, client service and operational leadership roles.

He prides himself on his ability to assess business situations, regardless of scope, and then assist as necessary in facilitating a collaborative solution using creativity and strong critical thinking skills. He is process driven by nature and therefore analytical in his approach, but creative in solving problems and implementing solutions. Building effective teams and inspiring them to peak performance is one of his passions and therefore one of his greatest strengths.<\/p> <p>He possesses excellent leadership skills and believes strongly in the concept of \"team\", cross functional or otherwise. He considers himself a visionary as well as a principle centered leader. Academically his qualifications include a Masters Degree in Management and Technology\/MBA from the University of Maryland University College as well as a B.A in Economics from the University of Maryland Baltimore County.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:<\/p> <p><br\/>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun! More information can be found at &lt;a&gt;www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com.&lt;\/a&gt; Hope to see you there!<\/p>",

Before and after the hike you will have an opportunity to pick up information about volunteering at the county animal shelter<\/p> <p>Dogs on the trail are encouraged but must remain on a leash and don't forget the dog litter bag!<\/p> <p>Please join a hike through portions of this 426-acre park as well as sections of the adjoining Loch Raven Reservoir. This location is a stream valley park comprised of pasture, cultivated gardens, open fields, woods, hedgerows, orchards and wooded piedmont hills. The diversity of this habitat makes it an excellent area for wildlife. There are many species of raptors such as the Red-tailed Hawk, American Kestrel, and Great Horned Owl, which prey on a healthy population of small mammals such as rabbits, deer mice, and meadow voles.<\/p> <p>White-tailed deer and red fox are also plentiful. Songbird populations include Baltimore Oriole, Bobolink, Eastern Meadowlark, Indigo Bunting, Eastern Bluebird, and many others. Belted Kingfishers and Great Blue Herons are often seen around the stream, Minebank Run.<\/p> <p>The terrain is a bit hilly but not too difficult. The trails surfaces are a bit uneven and there may be stream crossings based on which direction we take. Good shoes are recommended. Other items to consider include water and a hiking pole.<\/p> <p>Meet up time is 6:30 PM<\/p> <p>Directions for Visitors: Take the I-695 beltway to Exit 29. Turn left at the first light onto Cromwell Bridge Road. Turn left onto park entry road at 2175 Cromwell Bridge Road.<\/p> <p>Signs say, \u201cCromwell Valley Park, Willow Grove Farm, Baltimore County Department of Recreation and Parks.\u201d<\/p> <p>Follow the road across the bridge and park in gravel parking lot on the left.<\/p>",

Get there early.\u00a0 I plan to get there by 6:30.\u00a0 If you want to be sure you can sit with the group, I suggest getting there before 7.\u00a0 If you arrive and there's no space to sit with us, there's nothing I can do about that.<\/p> <p>2. Use the restroom before you arrive.<\/p> <p>3. Bring a camp chair and picnic supplies including food and drink.\u00a0 Sharing is optional.\u00a0 I would guess alcohol is technically not allowed on the public pier, but you will see plenty of it and no one seems to care.\u00a0 I suggest being as discrete as possible though, for example, if you bring wine, keep the bottle in a paper bag, pour it into plastic cups, and keep it down low when pouring.<\/p> <p>4. Be prepared to enjoy the evening.\u00a0 The show doesn't start until 8 pm, so we'll have a lot of time to sit and picnic.<\/p> <p>5. The long term weather forecast is upper 80's.\u00a0 I plan to bring an umbrella just in case, although at the moment, it doesn't look like rain.<\/p> <p>6. You can park in the Little Italy parking garage on the corner of S Central Ave and Bank St for $4 after 4 pm.\u00a0 It's about a 7 block walk to the Marriott Pier.<\/p> <p>7. I'll email my cell # to everyone Wednesday morning.\u00a0 Call if you have trouble finding us.\u00a0 Note however I'll only be taking calls until 8 pm--after that, I plan to turn my phone off so I can enjoy the picnic and concert.<\/p> <p>8. If you have any questions, please post them below in the comments.<\/p> <p>See everyone on Wednesday!<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Hi folks:<\/p> <p>I wanted to let you know about this Star Trek - Scifi media convention which I, Ellen Silber, and Patrick Lindsley have been going to in the Baltimore, MD area. When the details will be announced, I will let you know.<\/p> <p><br\/>About the con: It's a con which isn't as crazy big as Dragon Con. They have their share of Star Trek - media Scifi guests, lots of programming ranging from science, cosplay, hobby kit building, comic books, some anime, etc. A weekend cost of a ticket is\u00a0 now $90.00. They try to keep their costs as reasonable as possible. You get a lot of stuff for your membership. When there is a big media guest and they have to add on a charge, it's very reasonable. In the last few years, they big media guests were William Shatner, RIchard Dean Anderson, and via Skype - Leonard NImoy. Feel free to check out what they have done in the past.<\/p> <p>As for hotels to stay at, the convention hotel is not outrageous for the hotel rate. There's an Embassy Suites hotel across the street. It's very gorgeous. A wonderful buffet breakfast is included. The cost per night isn't bad either. If you want to lock in a very good with Embassy, you need to book it more than six months ahead of the con. About a quarter mile away from the con hotel is York Rd. It's like a cross between Central Ave. and Wolf Rd. in Albany. There are more hotels there which are more affordable, more restaurants, supermarkets, etc. Across from the convention hotel is the Hunt Valley Mall. It has lots of neat restaurants and had the god of supermarkets - Wegmans. There's also a light rail station from Maryland Transit Authority to take you to downtown Baltimore.<\/p> <p>Ellen and I and Patrick fly there Wednesday before the con to also make it a good vacation. We go to attractions in Baltimore and Washington, DC. . This year on Wednesdaym August 5th, we are flying out from Albany on an 11:50AM flight to BWI - Baltimore airport. We usually fly back to Albany on Monday after the con.<\/p> <p><br\/>I hope some of you can join us.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nShore Leave 37 August 7-9, 2015<\/p> <p><b>Shore Leave 37 will include:<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n<b>Writing Workshops:<\/b> Learn how to improve your writing from some of your favorite writers.

Just go to www.Pre-Dating.com\/dc\u00a0and enter PDPSMU to register and get your discount.<\/p> <p>By now you know it takes meeting a number of people before you find someone you click with. Sometimes it seems like hundreds! The problem is, how do you meet them in the first place? There are bars, blind dates, dating services, dating sites, but they all have their disadvantages and they take time ... lots of it. Plus it's no fun to risk rejection over and over again striking up conversations with people who might not even be single, if you even get the courage to speak to them. And if the conversation goes well it is still awkward exchanging phone numbers.<\/p> <p>With speed dating, you meet up to 12 people (sometimes more) singles in your age range in about 2 hours. Afterwards, if there's interest, (you discreetly circle on your interest sheet who you would like to see again), you'll receive an email with links to contact these event participants. There's no pressure, no rejection, no embarrassment, and no games.

The center is located at 424 Fourth Street in Annapolis.<\/p> <p>The sessions will be led by Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche. Born in Tibet in 1973, he is a monk, scholar, and author. The Dalai Lama and the Seventeenth Gyalwang Karmapa have glowingly endorsed his book \u201cThe Lamp of Reasoning and Scriptures of the Sage, the Buddha.\u201d He has received advanced Buddhist training from masters in India, Sikkim, and Nepal. Now a citizen of the United States, Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche makes his home in Annapolis, Maryland.<\/p> <p>One portion of the session will be dedicated to Lojong, a mind training practice in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition based on a set of fifty-nine slogans.<\/p> <p>The other part of the session is devoted to the practice of Chenrezig, the Buddha of Compassion. It is taught that the practice of Chenrezig helps people to cultivate genuine compassion for all sentient beings and ultimately leads us to the realization of enlightenment.\u00a0The meditation consists of chanting a liturgy and visualizing the form of Chenrezig. Although some aspects of the practice may seem foreign, attendees are encouraged to relax, delight in the ritual, and not become preoccupied with doing it \"right.\"<\/p> <p>People of all belief systems and current practitioners of all levels are welcome to attend. Visitors and members can attend on an \u201cas can\u201d basis, attending as much or as little as they are able. Attendees sit on floor cushions or chairs provided at the center<\/p> <p>The Gampopa Center was founded in 2009 by Tibetan born Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche based on the Buddhist understanding that the teachings of Buddha can bring people peace, happiness, and freedom. The center holds weekly study sessions, short courses, and special events at its Annapolis location.<\/p> <p>Ongoing Wednesday night attendees need not RSVP; we ask that first-time Wednesday night attendees RSVP because there is a limited amount of seating available. \u00a0<\/p> <p>In order to allow the Gampopa Center\u2019s activities to continue and flourish, people are encouraged to make a donation if they are so moved.<\/p> <p>Visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gampopacenter.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gampopacenter.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.gampopacenter.com\/<\/a><\/a> or for more information.<\/p>",

Although a $5-$10 donation is suggested, donations are not required for attendance.<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Each class will include:<\/b> guided meditation, instruction, opportunities to practice, and time for discussion, questions and answers.<\/p> <p><b>When and where:<\/b> We meet every Tuesday from 7:30-9:00 p.m. at Centennial High School, 4300 Centennial Lane, Ellicott City, MD, 21042, room 406. Please arrive early to settle into your seats - we start right at 7:30 p.m.<\/p> <p><b>We practice Insight Meditation<\/b>, a style of meditation that helps the mind attain deeper levels of calm concentration through sustained attention on the breath, then combines this with the crucial aspect of insight through contemplation of the mind and body and all of their changing and impermanent senses, emotions and thoughts. Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teacher:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a high school physics teacher who has been meditating for 25 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004. Stan is a mentor with the Insight Meditation Community of Washington (IMCW) and is a graduate of the Meditation Teacher Training Institute, a two-year certification program with senior Insight teachers Tara Brach, Jonathan Foust, Hugh Byrne, and Pat Coffey. He also teaches Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Stan also earned a Masters of Social Work in 1998.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Location: Oakland Manor Town Center (TC) Room.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>Park anywhere in the Oakland Manor Parking lot.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p><br\/>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>6. The group is not recommended for those under age 13.<\/p> <p>Please feel free to contact Stan Eisenstein at [masked] if you have any questions.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>",

A Twin Flame is quite literally the soul\u2019s other half, which parted before entering the 3rd dimensional experience and human incarnation. YET, the Twin Flame Reunion cannot occur unless the other person is WHOLE \u2013 or at least it is much less likely to last, if it does.<\/p> <p>So in this new old math \u2013 a HALF makes a WHOLE and TWO HALVES MAKE A WHOLE!<\/p> <p>How brilliant!<\/p> <p>Up until recently, most Twin Flames did not generally incarnate at the same time (or rarely did so), but took turns supporting each other through respective human lifetimes. However, at this special time on Earth, Twin Flame partners are incarnating together in greater numbers with the special purposes<br\/>of helping to maintain timelines, protect and augment energies, and move our world forward to what may be called the Golden Age of Gaia \u2013 quite literally, Heaven on Earth!<\/p> <p>Yes, despite what you may see on the news, this is not only possible \u2013 but it is happening in the present moment of Now \u2013 where ALL change occurs! Hooray!<\/p> <p>Since many Soul Mate connections are also quite compelling, familiar, and strong, how do you know whether you\u2019ve really found your \u201cpartner of ultimate destiny\u201d or Twin Flame?<\/p> <p>Would you like to know more about Twin Flames? Is it possible that you have found yours? Do you think you found him or her and then he or she \u201cran\u201d? How do you manifest your Twin Flame? What if you are already with someone else (or he or she is) and then you meet whom you believe to be your Twin Flame? Does everyone have a Twin Flame? What is the difference between a Twin Flame and a Soul Mate? HOW DO YOU ATTRACT YOUR TWIN FLAME?<\/p> <p>Find all of this out and more \u2013 and set more firmly-footed on the path to Grand Sacred Reunion with your Twin Flame. There are more ways to do so than you think! How quickly it happens is up to you. Find out how!<\/p> <p>Pay $25.00 at the door.<\/p> <p><br\/>See you at EarthTouch Healing Arts, beloveds! \u00a0Get ready to manifest your Twin Flame in the NOW - where all change takes place.<\/p>",

Movies are projected onto the outside wall of Ciao Bella Restaurant in the Da Mimmo Ristorante parking lot from a row home across the street. Folks arrive early to set up lawn chairs, listen to live entertainment, stroll the neighborhood, and eat at one of Little Italy's many restaurants. Instrumental in allowing this event to be created was the late \"Mr. John\" Pente, who wholeheartedly supported the Film Fest for the last 11 years of his life. Mr. John died in 2011 at age 100 after living in The Neighborhood for his entire life. He allowed a movie projector to be set up in his third floor bedroom window ... all for the good of the neighborhood. His nephew, the late Ray Lancelotta who died in 2014, had then purchased the home and generously continued the Film Fest tradition. For 2015, the Lancelotta family also have stepped up to continue the Film Fest.<\/i><\/p>",

Of course, this\u00a0is\u00a0something you\u00a0would\u00a0say especially if you have been touched by the paranormal before. Take the adventure now, with\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.examiner.com\/topic\/cat\">Cat<\/a>\u00a0Gasch, through her world of the paranormal as you never have before and you will be truly amazed.<\/p> <p>\"Cathy E. Gasch was born, raised, went to school, worked and still lives in the state of Maryland. She is currently semi-retired and lives in Washington County with her husband of thirty seven years and seven cats. She enjoys working in her yard and garden and enjoys making crafts. Most of Cathy\u2019s leisure time is spent reading and researching family history as well as historical\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.examiner.com\/review\/my-life-amidst-the-paranormal-by-author-cat-gasch#\">locations<\/a>. She loves to travel and has been to Ireland, Scotland, England and many wonderful and fascinating places in the United States. Cathy\u2019s paranormal experiences have spanned over 50 years, and through them, she continues to learn about herself and the world, often times, through the eyes of those who have passed on.\"<\/p> <p>Cat goes on to tell us about her life \"amidst the paranormal\"; \"I have been able to \u201csense\u201d ghosts since I was around five years old when our family moved into an early 20th century home that was in need of repairs and renovation.\"<\/p> <p>\"It was not until I was well into my teen years that I was able to share many of my experiences with family and friends. By that time, I had done much research into the \u201cparanormal\u201d through library and<a href=\"http:\/\/www.examiner.com\/review\/my-life-amidst-the-paranormal-by-author-cat-gasch#\">store<\/a>\u00a0bought books, hoping to find answers to my experiences. What I learned was that I was not alone in what had happened to me but it still did not answer the question\u2026why? Finally accepting my ability as a \u201csensitive\u201d shaped who I am, my way of thinking and how I live and accept my life. I still don\u2019t have answers as to why I am able to know when those who have passed are around and I probably never will until I too have passed on. \"Whatever the reason, despite difficulties growing up and not being believed, and whether or not people even believe me now, I know what I am capable of, am sure in what I do and am certain of my experiences. And this causes me to not fear what is beyond this life.\"<\/p> <p>\"I wrote this book at the prompting of a fellow believer, Mike Ricksecker, who thought that I should share my experiences. During the process of writing each story, I relived the experiences and learned new things about myself with a different perspective. The experiences are still fresh in my mind but putting them to paper allowed me to remember small details that would otherwise be lost to just myself. I can\u2019t thank Mike enough for believing in me and what I know in my heart and memory to be true\u2026.I have and still live amidst the paranormal.\"<\/p> <p>Walk with Cat throughout her venture of the paranormal, from being a very young child not knowing what she was seeing or why to growing up to trying to understand why she was given this gift of being able to \"see, feel, hear, sense\" \"them\" at \"their\" convenience.

        "description": "<p>Of all the instruments used in sound healing, the Gong is perhaps the most powerful, and the most mysterious. Used in ancient Chinese palaces and temples, and also in the tradition of Kundalini Yoga, <a href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/angelablueskies\/sets\/gong-samples\"><b>Gong Meditations<\/b><\/a>, also called Gong Baths, are deeply nourishing and restorative. Similar to an extended savasana, the softer sounds are soothing on a deep level, and as the sound level builds, the body and energy are cleared in profound ways. Through the intense vibrations of the sound, the body and mind are able to relax and surrender to the healing energies of the Gong, and as the waves of sound wash over participants, a deep energetic clearing occurs, leaving the participant feeling balanced, peaceful, and light. Class led by Angela Blueskies.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/2\/6\/6\/event_227933862.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Angela Blueskies<\/b> is a <i>Songkeeper<\/i>, sound healer, and medicine woman. A lifelong musician, she received her training as a classical flutist at the prestigious <i>Peabody Institute<\/i> in Baltimore. In her performing career, she began to long for a deeper sense of connection and presence with her audiences. It was while travelling in South America that Angela first encountered traditions that worked with songs and music for healing and transformation. Deeply influenced by sacred ceremonies from Peru and the traditions of bhakti yoga and kirtan, she began to experiment with creating music for healing and meditation. Expanding beyond her background as a classical flutist, in her sound healing sessions, Angela also works with voice, toning, and mantra, as well as frame drum, rattles, flutes from around the world, singing bowls, and the gong. Her <b>Sound Medicine Journeys<\/b> are intuitively guided energy healing sessions that use song, music, and sound to bring clearing, balancing, and a higher vibration of peace and joy to all those present. In addition to her work with <b>Sound Medicine Journeys<\/b>, she also leads kirtan with several wonderful musicians in the Baltimore\/Washington area, including her band <b>Bhakti Tree<\/b>.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun! More information can be found at &lt;a&gt;www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com.&lt;\/a&gt; Hope to see you there!<\/p>",

Perform the processes of synthetic genome assembly and discuss exciting developments in this rapidly emerging field.<\/p> <p>In this workshop we will be building our own new semi-synthetic genome! Join us as we apply synthetic biology techniques to create a viral genome (don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re working on viruses that only infect bacteria!) In addition to lab work, we will be discussing this brave new frontier in biological engineering- how this technology is currently being used to redesign cells and systems, and how society should respond to and regulate this new field. For those who have taken Build-a-Gene before, there will be some familiar techniques but there will be new techniques in viral replication and genome editing as well this year. Join us as we learn to synthesize new genomes from scratch!<\/p> <p><br\/>The course will take place between 9 am to 1 pm over the course of 5 days. The days are Aug 8, 15, 22, 29th, and Sept 5. \u00a0While we encourage you to take all sessions in the series, each session can stand on its own.

There is a cap of 20 participants, RSVP is needed by July 28th, and we will need someone in the group to either have a GPS geocashing app or device (we do not have one.) They will also provide coffee, doughnuts, and juice. Also, if you provide them with feedback about your experience you will receive a goodie bag!<\/p> <p>Please read below for more info:<\/p> <p>Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) provides water for Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery Counties. We are launching a series of geocaches in our T. Howard Duckett Reservoir property and would like to invite you to be among the first to find them. Geocaching is a family friendly activity that combines technology and nature. By using a GPS device or the geocaching app on a smartphone, participants can discover hidden geocaches along our geotrail and solve puzzles for a chance to win prizes. Participants may travel to just one cache, or all eight, and solve the puzzle at each site for a key code, which can then be entered online for a chance to win a hiking backpack stuffed with goodies. Winners will be randomly selected after 100 entries have been made. However, there will also be small prizes in each individual geocache. August 8, 2015 we will host a small launch event in the Suplee Recreation Area with light refreshments, information booths about WSSC programs, and of course, the chance to go geocaching. The tentative timetable is from 10 am -12 pm, but guests would be free to come and go as they please.<\/p>",

Beginner kayakers are provided kayaking instruction and skill building tips in a safe and controlled environment in one of our beautiful park pools. Not a beginner and just want to practice? We can go over the basics of rescue techniques and wet exits. We will be at the Cherry Hill Splash Park every Saturday from 1-3 pm there is a $2 general admission to enter the pool. Some folks just need a 15 min refresher and others want to just hang out at the pool. We recommend you bring a chair and what ever else you need to spend the afternoon at the pool. There is a 3 story spiral water slide at this pool(FYI)! Please come dressed to swim in the pool!<\/p> <p>Participants must be 50 pounds and up and children under 18 must be accompanied by a parent to kayak. RESERVATIONS ARE RECOMMENDED.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>So, I will be riding the 50 miler this year, but there are other options. \u00a0The start location has also changed to the McKeldin part of the park. \u00a0A little\u00a0incite\u00a0on this\u00a0course: \u00a0Everyone has to wade through the river this year, around mile 3. \u00a0Also, all of the rides start off on some of the tougher \/ long climb terrain the park can throw at you. \u00a0The return route is not to bad though. \u00a0They were nice coming back (except for climbing back to the start in McKeldin). \u00a0Beyond these notes here is a bunch of info I pulled off of MOREs site, and video I made of the 35 miler last year, along with links to the courses. \u00a0It might be good to state in the comments which ride you are signing up for so we can try to meet up!<\/p> <p>From the MORE Epic Website:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moreepics.com\/the-patapsco-epic\/\">Link to more site<\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Back for its 2nd edition, the Patapsco Epic is coming bigger and better than ever in 2015! This extended mountain bike adventure showcases the world class trail systems of Patapsco Valley State Park. With tons of steep descents and climbs, this course is by far the most technical and challenging of MORE's Epic Rides. Keep in mind this ride is not a race. You'll be able to enjoy it at your own pace, but you will need to be in shape to successfully complete this difficult ride. Support for each course includes a detailed map, well-marked course trails, killer aid stations, and a post-ride party with a meal ticket to fuel up after your Epic ride. All the net proceeds going directly back to the local trails, so you'll be riding toward better trails and having a blast doing it!<\/p> <p>The Patapsco Epic's General Terrain-The Patapsco Valley State Park follows a steep valley stream with trails snaking up and down each side of the valley. Expect the excitement of a roller coaster as you'll be going up and down most of the time with very little flat terrain when on the single track. Many climbs are 1\/4 to 1\/2 mile in length with some quite steep ascents. The trails are also somewhat rocky and rooty, not so much that you feel that you are on rocks all day, but enough that you know they are there. This makes for a challenging course! Although no one section is excessively demanding, the course keeps you working most of the time with very little flat or road sections to rest on. You'll know you're an Epic rider when you successfully complete one of the following courses:<\/p> <p>The 15 Miler-\u00a0Perfect for experienced beginners or riders who couldn't commit to consistent training leading up to the event to enjoy a taste of the Patapsco Epic riding experience. Expect your adventure to last approximately 2-3 hours.<\/p> <p>The 25 Miler-\u00a0This course will showcase the McKeldin, Woodstock, Alberton, &amp; Daniels Areas. Expect your adventure to last about 4-5 hours for a beginner with a high level of fitness, intermediate, or advanced rider.<\/p> <p>The 35 Miler-\u00a0This course will showcase the McKeldin, Woodstock, Alberton, Hollofield, Rockhaven, Pickall, &amp; Daniels Areas. Expect your adventure to last about 5-8 hours for an intermediate to advanced rider.<\/p> <p>The 50 Miler-\u00a0This course will showcase the McKeldin, Woodstock, Alberton, Hollofield, Avalon, Rockhaven, Pickall, &amp; Daniels Areas. Expect your adventure to last about 7-10 hours for an intermediate to advanced rider. This course will be beyond Epic and will redefine what you think is Epic!<\/p> <p>Camping *New for 2015*-\u00a0Get a few extra hours of sleep before your Epic ride by camping at the Patapsco Epic! Camping will be available on-site at McKeldin the evening of Saturday (Aug 8) into Sunday (Aug 9). Camping is $20\/night and offers a rustic setting (restrooms but no electric or showers available). Camping is limited to the first 50 campers and to tents only (sorry, no RVs, pop-ups). All campers must arrive by 8 pm Saturday evening, as the park gates will be closed overnight. There are two large communal fire pits and cooking grills available (No personal fire rings in the tent area). MORE will provide fire food. NO ALCOHOL WILL BE PREMITTED AT CAMPSITES. Please leave any valuables at home or in a locked car, as MORE will not be responsible for your belongings. Camping passes are available on Bike Reg when you register for your ride.<\/p> <p>Post Ride Party-\u00a0After completing one of the Patapsco Epic rides, what could make your day any better? A post-ride party of course! Come enjoy the festivities from 12 PM - 8 PM including 2 free beers (must be 21 or over) compliments of New Belgium Brewery, a meal ticket to your choice of food truck, and some of the best mountain bike company around! That's right, new for 2015 food trucks will be on-site to offer a wider variety of meals. Post-ride party included for paid participants and volunteers, but we encourage you to bring family and friends to help celebrate your Epic day. Additional passes may be purchased on Bike Reg when registering for your ride.<\/p> <p>A video I made of last years 35 miler (was actually 39 miles). \u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-1ieygvu6Rk\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-1ieygvu6Rk<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/ridewithgps.com\/routes\/7333771\">[masked] mile course link<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/ridewithgps.com\/routes\/8485825\">35 mile course link<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/ridewithgps.com\/routes\/8662765\">25 mile course link<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Hope to see a bunch of MVDers there!!!<\/p> <p>Waiver:\u00a0Mountain biking is a risky sport, By signing up for this meetup you are agreeing to our waiver located here:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVD-Mountain-Bikers\/pages\/Standard_Waiver_for_Meetup_Rides\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVD-Mountain-Bikers\/pages\/Standard_Waiver_for_Meetup_Rides\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVD-Mountain-Bikers\/pages\/Standard_Waiver_for_Meetup_Rides\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p>",

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\". That way, we know not to be waiting for you. Thanks.<\/b><\/p> <p>So come join us on Sunday for a brisk walk in the park. It's a great way to clean out the cobwebs and start a Sunday.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>The field of \"New Thought\" can be a broad and ambiguous one. It would seem that there is an endless flow of authors, speakers and Spiritual Leaders prepared to deliver the latest insights and approaches to spirituality. From Deepak to Oprah, everyone is spreading the news that there is a new approach to life being explored and the news is good.<\/p> <p>While there are several avenues to revelation, we also understand that we must find common ground in our community and with others in order to honor every path without mandating that any single one is the final authority on individual spirituality. It's easy to get hung up on verbiage and opinion rather than commune in spiritual fellowship when the topic at hand is as close as our own soul.<\/p> <p>Religious Science is that common ground. It is a philosophy that lies back of all the opinion and approach of infinite possibilities. As a community, it is important for us to be able to identify that common ground to bring us closer together and heal the divides caused by differences in pinion and approach. As an individual, it is the greatest way for us to forgive those who have used their approach and opinions to injure, harm or otherwise divide us from accepting our loving place within humanity... and to remember to save a place for them as well.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our speaker this week is Reverend Brian Akers, Senior Minister of the Columbia Center for Spiritual Living.\u00a0 Come to this Meetup and see if CCSL is the spiritual community that you have been looking for.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/9\/7\/4\/600_422410612.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

The answer to these questions is a simple \u201cNO\u201d. It is, in fact, quite the opposite. Anarchism is not some teenage dream of living with no rules and doing whatever you want with no consequences. Anarchism is the idea that responsibility for your own actions is the only way to have a truly free society. Anarchism is the idea that no man or woman should be able to decide what you do with your life.<\/p>",

The plots are not important. (I'm not even sure they had plots.) But you can watch a somewhat tongue-in-cheek 10 minute video summary of the first 6 movies at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.avclub.com\/article\/all-fast-and-furious-movies-summarized-10-minutes-217453\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.avclub.com\/article\/all-fast-and-furious-movies-summarized-10-minutes-217453\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.avclub.com\/article\/all-fast-and-furious-movies-summarized-10-minutes-217453<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>If that's not enough to sell you, <b>Furious 7<\/b> has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 81%.

Yet\u00a0 the very technology designed for our well-being often serves only to isolate us from one another and distance us from the experience of all that is truly divine.<\/p> <p><br\/>The Bhakti Lounge is a place where incredible transformation and healing takes place all through the culture of bhakti. Meditation, Kirtan, Discussions on the Bhagavad Gita and other ancient texts from the Vedic tradition , Vegetarian food prepared using Bhakti &amp; Ayurvedic principles create an environment where lifelong friendships are made.

The Scenarios for Adventure 1 and Adventure 3 are also available at the store and can be run by anyone with a copy of the core card game and the relevant Adventure Deck numbers. If you can bring a core game please list that with your RSVP so we can expand the number of player seats.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Adventure 0-2 - A Pirate's Life<\/b><\/p> <p>Yo ho! A pirate\u2019s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\u2019s more to a pirate\u2019s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\u2019s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate\u2019s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\u2019s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.<\/p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that\u2019s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there\u2019s power, there\u2019s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play, as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we are sure we have space for, but if there is more interest, we can almost certainly make more room. So please sign up for the wait list if you want to play.<\/p> <p>3.

Yes, for years, even though our permit was until 10:30 PM, we sometimes played until 11, 11:30 and sometimes even past midnight. Until-a new, nasty custodian turned us in to the Vice Principal, who sent an e-mail to the Rec council who forwarded it to us. We then had to be out of the gym 10:30 PM sharp, NO EXCEPTIONS.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>",

Get there early.\u00a0 I plan to get there by 6:30.\u00a0 If you want to be sure you can sit with the group, I suggest getting there before 7.\u00a0 If you arrive and there's no space to sit with us, there's nothing I can do about that.<\/p> <p>2. Use the restroom before you arrive.<\/p> <p>3. Bring a camp chair and picnic supplies including food and drink.\u00a0 Sharing is optional.\u00a0 I would guess alcohol is technically not allowed on the public pier, but you will see plenty of it and no one seems to care.\u00a0 I suggest being as discrete as possible though, for example, if you bring wine, keep the bottle in a paper bag, pour it into plastic cups, and keep it down low when pouring.<\/p> <p>4. Be prepared to enjoy the evening.\u00a0 The show doesn't start until 8 pm, so we'll have a lot of time to sit and picnic.<\/p> <p>5. The long term weather forecast is upper 80's.\u00a0 I plan to bring an umbrella just in case, although at the moment, it doesn't look like rain.<\/p> <p>6. You can park in the Little Italy parking garage on the corner of S Central Ave and Bank St for $4 after 4 pm.\u00a0 It's about a 7 block walk to the Marriott Pier.<\/p> <p>7. I'll email my cell # to everyone by 2:30 pm on Tuesday.\u00a0 Call if you have trouble finding us.\u00a0 Note however I'll only be taking calls until 8 pm--after that, I plan to turn my phone off so I can enjoy the picnic and show.<\/p> <p>8. If you have any questions, please post them below in the comments.<\/p> <p>See everyone on Tuesday!<\/p>",

But is it possible that facing our mortality can inspire us to live our lives more fully?<\/p> <p>\n\n\nDeath Makes Life Possible follows cultural anthropologist and scientist Marilyn Schlitz, Ph.D., as she explores the mysteries of life and death from a variety of perspectives and world traditions. Sparked by her own near death experience as a teenager, Schlitz has been delving into the nature of consciousness and death for the past three decades.<\/p> <p>The film looks at how popular culture deals with the ever-present fear many have about our own mortality. Interviews with mental health experts, cultural leaders, and scientists explore the meaning of death and how we can learn to live without fear. The interviews and evidence presented are interwoven with personal stories of people facing their own death as well as those who report encounters beyond death. The narrative is illustrated with vivid imagery.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nDeath Makes Life Possible features some of the leading scientists, anthropologists, philosophers, spiritual teachers and thinkers of our time \u2013 including Yassir Chadley, Deepak Chopra, Mingtong Gu, Stuart Hameroff, Lauren Artress, Michael Bernard Beckwith, Dean Radin, Rupert Sheldrake, Rudy Tanzi, Luisah Teish, Dr. Jim Tucker and others.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nDeath Makes Life Possible offers a deep and thoughtful exploration into the ultimate question we all face.<\/p>",

Please arrive early to settle into your seats - we start right at 7:00 p.m.<\/p> <p>We practice Insight Meditation, a style of meditation that helps the mind attain deeper levels of calm concentration through sustained attention on the breath, then combines this with the crucial aspect of insight through contemplation of the mind and body and all of their changing and impermanent senses, emotions and thoughts. Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teaching Schedule:<\/b><\/p> <p>6\/23 Mira\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 6\/30 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>7\/7\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7\/14\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07\/21\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7\/28\u00a0 Stan<\/p> <p>8\/4\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8\/11\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a08\/18\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8\/25\u00a0\u00a0Stan<\/p> <p><b>Teachers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a former high school physics teacher who has been meditating for\u00a030 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.

Wheels rolling by 6:00. We will not wait past 6:00. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Pace:<\/b> Pace will be Intermediate, approx. 6.5 to 7 mph. Appropriate for average to riders, but not for beginners, or people who are not riding at least once a week. \u00a0Attitude is laid-back and friendly, but please ensure you can handle the pace and length of this ride before committing. This is a no-drop ride, i.e., we wait up for everyone at intersections. (Note: if you don\u2019t want to wait up for slower riders, this is NOT the ride for you, but please also survey your current fitness, as no one likes to be the one person holding up a larger group). \u00a0Please also note Ptap rides tend to be about 1 mph slower than Rosy, or Fairland, due terrain. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Terrain:<\/b> Ranges from Easy to Difficult. Most trails are in great shape, but plan on some mud spots. There are a few very steep climbs, rocks and technical sections, log overs (up to 10\" logs, and 3' stacks), tight single track (12\" wide in spots), and a stream crossing or two. \u00a0A strong\/advanced rider will be able to clean most sections, others will need to get off of their bikes in spots. \u00a0This is a friendly ride, so we will wait up for everyone, just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places. \u00a0This is a video edit I made from last fall through winter. \u00a0We won't hit all of this terrain, but gives you a feel for Patapsco:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Distance:<\/b>\u00a0With days getting longer we will be minimally getting 10 miles, and if conditions and light allow, we will push towards 20. \u00a0Exact route will change depending on group dynamics, trail conditions, daylight, etc. \u00a0I will typically have route planned in my head at the beginning of the ride, but will modify as needed to get us back at a reasonable time. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Duration:<\/b> I shoot to have us back before it gets dark (so 2 to 3 hours as the days get longer). \u00a0This can change with mechanical issues, and group dynamics though. \u00a0As this is a weekday ride, the stops will be just long enough for the last rider to catch their breath. \u00a0Note: wheels roll at stated time, so please don\u2019t be late.<\/p> <p><b>Bring:<\/b> Helmet (required), water (as much as you can carry), spare tube\/patch kit, pump\/CO2, multi-tool, I.D., emergency contact info where it can be easily located on your person, and a good attitude, as this ride is as much about camaraderie as it is about riding. Take a look at your bike and make sure it is in good working condition (Ptap will take its toll on the bike). \u00a0Bring a light, as you might need it. \u00a0There are ton of acceptable lights under $20 on Amazon right now. \u00a0Just look for a T6 Cree LED Bike light, with minimially 1000 lumens. \u00a0Here is a link to one: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006Y1FK18\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">Cheap 1000 lumen bike light<\/a>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B006QQX3C4\/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=3FJIG6WZ09712&amp;coliid=I15GIMB04YOTYI\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><b>Weather:<\/b> Shine Only (there will undoubtedly be some mud, but no ride if it\u2019s raining or the trails are too muddy).

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:<\/p> <p><br\/>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun!

The film explores our brief existence among the Cosmos (Chapter I), then moves on to the perceptions of our Mind (Chapter II), the nature of our Body (Chapter III), the infinite capacity of our Heart (Chapter IV), and ultimately to the mysterious energy of the Soul (Chapter V). Initially, these chapters will appear unrelated to each other. But as the film progresses it becomes clear that all life is interconnected, and each chapter represents the totality of our mortal experience, which is only measured in decades.<\/p> <p>With a cast of 100 voices all speaking as one voice, UNITY is a genuine cinematic experience unlike any other.<\/p>",

Although a $5-$10 donation is suggested, donations are not required for attendance.<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Each class will include:<\/b> guided meditation, instruction, opportunities to practice, and time for discussion, questions and answers.<\/p> <p><b>When and where:<\/b> We meet every Tuesday from 7:30-9:00 p.m. at Centennial High School, 4300 Centennial Lane, Ellicott City, MD, 21042, room 406. Please arrive early to settle into your seats - we start right at 7:30 p.m.<\/p> <p><b>We practice Insight Meditation<\/b>, a style of meditation that helps the mind attain deeper levels of calm concentration through sustained attention on the breath, then combines this with the crucial aspect of insight through contemplation of the mind and body and all of their changing and impermanent senses, emotions and thoughts. Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teacher:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a high school physics teacher who has been meditating for 25 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p><br\/>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>6. The group is not recommended for those under age 13.<\/p> <p>Please feel free to contact Stan Eisenstein at [masked] if you have any questions.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>",

Then on the water we will continue with stretching exercises while seated in kayaks. Once we have loosened up we will paddle upriver with guided meditation for a short distance. Then kaykers will have the opportunity to concentrate on their individual paddling techniques. This would be a good time to plan ahead to practice particular strokes you would like to work on.<\/p> <p>The paddle upriver will be in silence to support the meditative process. We will paddle about two miles then stop for a ten-minute meditation session on land before lunch.\u00a0Silence will be optional at lunch and on the downriver paddle.<\/p> <p>You are required to wear a PFD and bring a whistle.\u00a0Bring water, lunch\/snacks, a hat, and sunscreen, comfortable clothes that could get wet and sandals\/water shoes.<\/p> <p>11:00 AM is on the water time so be sure to arrive with plenty of time to unload your kayak and get ready. There are no bathroom facilities at Daniels Dam. We should be off the water by 2:00PM.<\/p> <p>Kayaking involves known and unanticipated risks including physical injury and death that cannot be eliminated without jeopardizing the essential quality of the sport. Group organizers and leaders and other members cannot pay continuous attention to all participants. Participants must be responsible for their own safety. Don\u2019t overestimate your skills and abilities. Take instructional courses to learn about paddling technique, safety, self-rescue and hypothermia. Be aware of the tides, currents and weather conditions that will affect your safety on the days you paddle. Cooperate with group organizers, leaders and other members to insure your own safety as well as the safety of others and make it the fun, enjoyable day on the water it should be.<\/p>",

The featured group this week is D'Vibe &amp; Conga, a popular local band that plays a mix of good time tunes, and even some Jethro Tull. We saw them play at the barBAYque festival in May.

Look for us having a good time or call Jake at[masked]-8435.

Drinking Skeptically provides an opportunity for skeptics to talk, share ideas (and yes, drink) in a casual, relaxed atmosphere. We discuss the issues of the day and whatever else is on our minds. But most of all, we have fun while promoting skepticism, science, and rationality. Don't drink? Don't let that stop you from joining us! Some of the world's most famous skeptics are teetotallers, and we are happy to have you! Remember that drinking skeptically means drinking responsibly. If there's one thing science has taught us, it's the effects of alcohol on the human body.

        "description": "<p>Free Reiki Share in Columbia, MD for people new to Reiki or experienced practitioners. This event is open to Reiki Practitioners as well as those simply curious about Reiki. Reiki practitioners of all levels of training, as well as all lineages, often enjoy the opportunity to participate in communal Reiki sessions known as Reiki Shares or Reiki Circles. The sessions give each person a chance to learn from one another as practitioners, as well as benefiting from multiple healing hands during the sessions. At this event we will take turns performing and receiving Reiki. Those that are not Reiki practitioners will be pared up with experienced Reiki practitioners. This is a fun event to be enjoyed by all. Please let me know in your response if you are new to Reiki or a practitioner of some level.

She locks her huge brown eyes with a client\u2019s and asks directly, but respectfully, \u201cDo you really need this? Why? How does it make you feel when I take it away?\u201d And very occasionally, when a person seems unreasonably attached to a shopping bag of old birthday cards or an ugly ashtray pilfered from a restaurant in Greece, she pulls out the tough love: \u201cAre you going to give me trouble with this?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>As the host of the Discovery Home Channel\u2019s hit show\u00a0Neat, Buttigieg provides clutter control and guidance to a new household every week. She\u2019s something between an organizer and a headshrinker, with certifications as a professional organizer and as a life coach. She simultaneously cleans out closets while slowly uncovering subconscious \u201cblocks\u201d that make a person want to hoard junk or prevent them from putting their dirty clothes in the hamper.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Her gentle leadership made a lifelong fan out of client Denise Fujiwara, who says Buttigieg \u201cis a living example of what you can do with an affirmative attitude.\u201d The Toronto-based choreographer was lost trying to sort out her home office to make room for a house renovation when she called in Buttigieg to help. As someone who runs her own choreography business and dance troupe, Fujiwara\u2019s office is prone to clutter. \u201cMy office was a horrendous mess,\u201d she says. She describes stacks of boxes, piles of unfiled papers, photographs, video tapes, press releases \u2013 essentially 15 years\u2019 worth of disorder and confusion.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d tried to sort it out in the past, but I hadn\u2019t had the skills to do it properly until I worked with Hellen. In about 6 hours, she did what I couldn\u2019t do in 15 years,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The two went around the room in an orderly way, starting at the door and working clockwise. \u201cOccasionally, I\u2019d get stuck on something, and she\u2019d push me to make a decision,\u201d says Fujiwara. \u201cShe pushed through, and in the end I felt euphoric to be relieved of all that stuff.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg unloads stuff with a dancer\u2019s grace and a politician\u2019s diplomacy. Anyone would think she was born taking charge of people\u2019s unruly environs, teaching them how to be better organized. In a way, that\u2019s true. She says she was always organized, even as a teenager, when most kids live among piles of laundry, music collections and notebooks. She was also always a confident speaker. In grammar school, she was the girl who narrated the school plays.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In fact, Buttigieg moves and speaks so naturally in front of the camera and with such calm assertiveness, no one would guess that not long ago she was at a loss for what to do with her life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI had been out of the workforce for almost 10 years as a stay-at-home mom, but I lacked confidence, and I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she says from her home in Oakville, a suburb of Toronto, Canada.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She graduated from Seneca College in Toronto with a degree in radio and television broadcasting, and worked briefly as an administrator and fitness instructor. But then she had two children and took off nearly 10 years from work to raise them. Those 10 years at home had slowly whittled away her confidence as a businessperson, but she still wanted to launch a new career \u2013 and have some adult conversation. Her solution? In 1999, she joined City Centre Toastmasters.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cToastmasters changed my life,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She means that in the most literal sense. It started with one of the first lessons any new Toastmaster learns: talk about what you know. Buttigieg started writing speeches about what she knew, and as someone who was naturally neat, she talked about organizing. And then at one contest she gave a speech called \u201cSimple Simon\u201d about simplifying your life by letting go of clutter, and it launched a new career.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cGiving speeches is a journey of self-discovery,\u201d she says. \u201cHow often in life do people really listen to us? At Toastmasters, people are truly listening; they\u2019re not thinking about what they\u2019ll say back. It\u2019s a safe place to speak, so I could use my speeches to work out what resonated with the audience.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>And also what resonated with her. That speech was the nugget that now sits at the center of her professional life. In fact, she still uses parts of the same speech today when she gives presentations: \u201cIf you would like to get a taste of the simple life, don\u2019t let\u00a0stuff\u00a0complicate it. Commit to following these three simple steps: If you don\u2019t use it, lose it; if you don\u2019t need it, don\u2019t buy it; and when you bring one item in, take one item out.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>This would become her mantra in several ways. It sparked her desire to become a life coach and also tapped into her abilities as an organizer. Starting her own organizing business, called WeOrganizeU, helped pay for the life-coaching certification. Soon, a group of producers approached her about a new show that would blend her gifts for tidying up with her ability to lead people, and by 2004\u00a0Neat\u00a0hit the North American airwaves.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg credits Toastmasters with more than just sparking a good idea; she also says she honed her skills as a leader and built confidence. Shalini Alleluia, president of City Centre Toastmasters, says Buttigieg faced a short learning curve thanks to her take-charge attitude.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cHellen had lots of energy and was articulate and vibrant,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe always smiled and was willing to try anything.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Alleluia says even though Buttigieg was a new member, she asked her to chair a speech contest and encouraged her to assume meeting roles. Soon Buttigieg was helping others to be better speakers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI think Hellen was more of a mentor to other people than other people being a mentor to her,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe has a charisma that makes people want to follow her and to be like her in personality and capability. She\u2019s a good listener, and she always pays attention to the evaluation notes. I once told her she was very loud and didn\u2019t have expression in her delivery, and she really listened.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Like any good Toastmaster, Buttigieg is still seeking advice on how to improve. She still asks Alleluia for feedback on her presentations and episodes of the TV show. \u201cI\u2019m honest, and I\u2019ll tell her what I thought the show lacked or what I learned,\u201d says Alleluia.\u00a0<\/p> <p>While Alleluia coaches Buttigieg to improve some public speaking skills, her student is working toward a broader purpose. \u201cI\u2019m a teacher,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel that whether I\u2019m organizing or coaching or speaking, there\u2019s still that element of wanting to pass on the information I know to improve other people\u2019s lives.\u201d<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead The\u00a0Toastmaster\u00a0on Your iPad!<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/iPadMag\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/iPadMag<\/a><\/p> <p>Access the Toastmasters International iPad\u00ae app by following these steps:<\/p> <p>1.

If we get a big turnout, please be prepared to sit on the dock with a mobil chair if you have one or on the bulkhead, which is made of wood. There is lots of metered parking and places to eat. You can also bring food and beverages of your choice. I have coolers and a small fridge on board if you need them. We shall simply sit onboard or the dock and chat. I will play a bit of back round music for our listening pleasure. I do hope you can make it! Please RSVP sooner than later so I will have an idea of how many to expect. I can be reached on my cell in case you can't find us or need to contact me at (410) 299-6037. See you there!<\/p> <p>~ Michael ~<\/p>",

Let's go see their facility, get a tour and sample some of their products! You can't beat learning and having fun at the same time :)<\/p> <p>They don't have food, but you are welcome to bring some, and certainly bring friends! They have an open happy hour, so the more the merrier!<\/p> <p>The tour is free...and $8 for a flight of 4 meads. Roughly a drink's worth. I am sure Charm City Meadworks would love it if you left the premises with a bottle or two or more!<\/p> <p><br\/>This is a joint meetup with the Charm City Social Club group.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.charmcitymeadworks.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.charmcitymeadworks.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.charmcitymeadworks.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.charmcitymeadworks.com\/\"><br\/><\/a><\/p>",

The MYC has a large swimming pool, covered picnic area, and a fine restaurant, where we plan to dine on Saturday evening.

On arriving at MYC, we will have use of the pool and picnic area for a Happy Hour, followed by dinner at the restaurant.<\/p> <p>If you want to let the Skippers know of your desire to go on this cruise, please RSVP here. We have had a good response from the skippers, and expect several boats to join this cruise.\u00a0Since we don't know the exact number of boats available yet, they will not be listed on the Meetup site and the number of RSVP's is unlimited.\u00a0Each Skipper will be choosing a\u00a0balanced crew consisting of new club members, those who haven't cruised in a while and those with sailing and\/or cruising experience.<\/p> <p>In addition,\u00a0there will be a\u00a0fee\/deposit of $30\u00a0when you RSVP.\u00a0 The fee helps cover the cost of the marina slip at MYC (some of the cost is subsidized by the CSA.) If it turns out that there is no space for you on this cruise, your fee\/deposit will be returned. Please send a check to our Treasurer, Diane Derr,\u00a0when you RSVP (her address will be given when you RSVP).<\/p> <p><i>This event is for paid CSA Organization members only.

        "description": "<p>We've tried this before and it has worked out well. We use smaller tables that are near to each other. At each small table we'll have two speakers and roughly every 15-20 minutes we'll shift people one spot over so there is a new pairing each time. This way people of all levels can practice together and also get to know each other. Switching pairs also keeps things interesting and the meetup moving right along.<\/p> <p>When beginning speakers listen to intermediate speakers talking with each other that helps you pick up the correct cadence and pronunciation. Same goes for intermediate speakers listening to native speakers.<\/p> <p>Beginners can learn from intermediate and native speakers. Intermediate speakers can learn by teaching beginners and also by listening to native speakers. And our native speakers are doing us a great community service. ;)<\/p>",

It's an easy walking tour around Spa Creek to Eastport that will open your eyes to the wonderful lifestyle which has made Annapolis the center of good living on the Chesapeake Bay for 300 years.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our group does a similar walk during winter to experience the waterfront's stark beauty when its cold. This time we'll enjoy the lush green sights of summer by extending our walkabout to Eastport and Horn Point. Those who want to relax and see a bit of the harbor can return by riding the water taxi up Spa Creek to Acton's Cove Park, which is just a few blocks from Reynolds Tavern. Heartier souls can return on foot by retracing their steps and walking up Main Street \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Meet Up and Parking<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll meet in front of the Maryland Hall that's conveniently situated two blocks from West Street near the Westin Hotel. It's a converted high school that offers nice restrooms and plenty of FREE parking in the adjoining lots. Maryland Hall is the perfect spot to start our adventure!\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Walkabout Route<\/b><\/p> <p>Several of us have explored Spa Creek by kayak enjoying the sights of beautiful homes, impressive yachts, and lovely nautical vistas. Now you'll find out what it looks like from land.\u00a0Total walking distance is probably five miles, but who's counting?<\/p> <p>Most people\u00a0seeing Annapolis rarely venture beyond the stores and restaurants along Main Street and the City Dock area. They're missing some lovely nearby neighborhoods that offer a charming mix of historic homes, newer structures, tiny city parks, tree-lined streets, and abundant water views making this an ideal place for an afternoon stroll. The pace of life is peaceful, and it's hard to believe downtown Annapolis is just a few blocks away.<\/p> <p>Starting from the Maryland Hall, our SHR group will head towards Spa Creek and follow the shoreline neighborhood streets all the way to the 6th Street bridge that will take us over to Eastport. The streets generally end up at small waterfront parks, so there are many nice views along the way.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/2\/e\/600_435754606.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/8\/c\/600_435754700.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/e\/4\/600_435754788.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Exploring the Eastport Waterfront<\/b><\/p> <p>On the other side of Spa Creek lies the Eastport neighborhood with its variety of maritime businesses and cool streets lined with historic homes. Eastport is on a peninsula framed by Spa Creek and Back Creek a few blocks away. At the tip facing the Chesapeake Bay is Horn Point, one of the many waterfront parks in Annapolis.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our group will stroll around Eastport to enjoy the laid back vibe, catch the harbor views at Horn Point, and refresh ourselves with food and drinks at the Boatyard Grill that's a favorite SHR happy hour destination.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/0\/7\/f\/600_435752895.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/0\/e\/7\/600_435752999.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/e\/f\/7\/600_435752503.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Return by Water Taxi or Foot<\/b><\/p> <p>There is a convenient water taxi dock right across Chester Ave. from Davis' Pub. The taxi boat will come pick up groups of three or more people on Back Creek at 15-25 minutes past the hour when phoned at[masked]-0033. The boat goes around Horn Point to City Dock, and then up Spa Creek. It's not a long trip, but the water taxi is a fun way to get off our feet, relax, and ride back enjoying the sights of Annapolis harbor, the Naval Academy, and all the impressive yachts and homes. You can even grab a drink at Davis' Pub while waiting for it to arrive.<\/p> <p>On Spa Creek, the water taxi can stop at Acton Cove for people who want to visit Reynolds Tavern. For those going directly back to their cars, the taxi can stop at Amos Garrett Park which is just two blocks from Maryland Hall where we started.<\/p> <p>The taxi fare is variable depending on the zone and distance traveled. You should bring cash to pay the captain and expect to pay around $10-15 per person for the trip. Full details are available on the Annapolis water taxi website:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/cruisesonthebay.com\/annapolis-water-taxi\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/cruisesonthebay.com\/annapolis-water-taxi\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/cruisesonthebay.com\/annapolis-water-taxi\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/e\/5\/b\/600_435752347.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/e\/8\/d\/600_435752397.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Last Stop at Reynolds Tavern<\/b><\/p> <p>Those who are interested can get off the taxi at Acton Cove and head three blocks up to Reynolds Tavern at Church Circle. Reynolds features\u00a0the\u00a01747 Pub downstairs and a nice outdoor patio with good food and drinks. It's a relaxing place to hang out, and very convenient for returning to the Maryland Hall where our cars are parked. You can either walk one mile back up West Street or catch the Circulator bus to Westgate Circle for $1.00. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Details below:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reynoldstavern.org\/1747-pub\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.reynoldstavern.org\/1747-pub\/<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/d\/b\/600_435752731.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Final Details<\/b><\/p> <p>This event requires decent walking weather.

Twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise Finch\u2014\"Scout\"\u2014returns home from New York City to visit her aging father, Atticus. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise's homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town, and the people dearest to her. Memories from her childhood flood back, and her values and assumptions are thrown into doubt. Featuring many of the iconic characters from\u00a0To Kill a Mockingbird,\u00a0Go Set a Watchman\u00a0perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past\u2014a journey that can only be guided by one's own conscience.<\/p> <p>Written in the mid-1950s,\u00a0Go Set a Watchman\u00a0imparts a fuller, richer understanding and appreciation of Harper Lee. Here is an unforgettable novel of wisdom, humanity, passion, humor, and effortless precision\u2014a profoundly affecting work of art that is both wonderfully evocative of another era and relevant to our own times. It not only confirms the enduring brilliance of\u00a0To Kill a Mockingbird, but also serves as its essential companion, adding depth, context, and new meaning to an American classic.<\/p>",

Here is a little more about her:<\/p> <p>Imogene asked me for a bio. So confusing. Did she want all the information, like how I was employed as a clown while in grad school or that I appeared on national network's reality television show? Did she want to know my first job was as a gas pumper at a filling station and my last real job was Regional VP of Operations for a major assisted living company? I'm not a regular person who's taken a normal path and I'm not going to write a normal bio. So why don't we try this:<\/p> <p><br\/>I'm 48% mouth. 86% risk taker. 86.25% careful analyst. 110% real. 0% statistical genius.<\/p> <p><br\/>I've never done anything the way I was \"supposed\" to do it.<\/p> <p><br\/>I dropped out of high school at 16 and never went back. Without my GED or diploma, I earned my undergraduate degree from Purdue University and my graduate degrees from American University. I've gone into many types of fields for which I had zero qualifications and managed to learn the system until I could alter it to suit my needs.<\/p> <p><br\/>It's been a fun ride, as I've climbed the corporate ladder in a few different companies, worked as a public speaker for Citizens Against Crime and as a Criminalist at the US ATTY's Office, managed HR for Prudential in Indiana, and co-written and\/or written over 50 books as a ghostwriter. Those are the highlights.<\/p> <p><br\/>Meanwhile, Amazon is my passion. I've gone from $0 to $20k per month in sales at around 42% profit in about 7 months, part-time. And that's what I will be talking about.<\/p>",

Typically, this is your LEGAL name as shown on your driver's license. Sometimes, it may be under a company name if you set up your Paypal or credit card account that way. If you are not sure what it is, please take a moment to log into your Paypal account (it will say \"Welcome, [your account name]\" at the top) or your credit card account to find out. If you are RSVP'd under someone else's payment, please use that name for check-in.<\/p> <p><b>Refund Policy<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we paid in advance for this event, all sales are final unless the event is canceled or rescheduled. If the event is canceled, you will receive a full refund. If the event is rescheduled,\u00a0an UPDATE will be posted at the top of the event posting, and the UPDATE will also be sent as an email to the yes RSVPs. A full refund will be given to those that let us know within 3 calendar days of the UPDATE email if you are unable to make the new date. No refunds will be given after that time.\u00a0Thanks for understanding. =)<\/p> <p><b>Ticket Resell<\/b><\/p> <p>Similar to a concert ticket or a football game ticket, you are free to sell your ticket to someone else if you are unable to attend. I suggest posting in the comment box for the event, that you have a ticket for sale. Work out payment between yourselves, and have\u00a0<b>the seller only send the organizer a \"message\" through their Meetup profile<\/b>\u00a0(do not comment in the comment box of the event posting) letting us know the first AND last name and Meetup profile URL (if a member) of the person taking your spot.\u00a0I host a lot of events and groups, so please also let us know the event name and group name the ticket transfer is for.\u00a0<b>You must let us know by the RSVP close time<\/b>\u00a0of 12:30pm on the day of the event.<\/p> <p><b>Special Needs<\/b><\/p> <p>If you have any special needs (e.g. wheelchair, dietary for events with food included, etc.), let us know in advance (a week or more before the event) and we will do our best to accommodate. If you let us know the day of the event, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accommodate. Thank you for understanding and we appreciate the courtesy of a heads up!<\/p> <p><b>Rain Policy<\/b><\/p> <p>If it's light rain, we're still on. If there's lightning, we'll need to reschedule or cancel. Hopefully, if there is precipitation, it will just be a passing summer rain.\u00a0If it looks like the weather will impact our event,\u00a0I'll post an update by 1pm the day of the event. If we cancel, or reschedule and you are unable to make the new date, you will receive a full refund.<\/p>",
