After about 10 minutes of meditation, we will share the inspirational guidance that we receive.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Aside from sharing the message that we receive from the Holy Spirit, we don't talk during this meetup event. We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

It replaces traditional moderate-intensity exercise with maximum-intensity exercise, and trades short intervals of intensity for short periods of rest. The secret? Long periods of explosive intensity. You\u2019ll do cardio and plyometric drills with intervals of strength, power, resistance, and core training. With Insanity, you can burn up to 1,000 calories in an hour.

It is a small but rapidly growing field in biology, GLYCOBIOLOGY AS IMMUNE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>While sugar-nutrients do not treat specific diseases, they do allow for the cells to send proper messages within the body. When our cells communicate clearly, it is amazing what the immune system is capable of doing. Our bodies know how to make corrections and restore proper function, given the raw materials they need. These critical sugars are like the vowels in our alphabet. When the vowels are in place we understand our conversation.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Glycans are complex carbohydrate structures that cover the surfaces of all mammalian cells, as they are added to proteins- and lipid backbones by the so-called glycosylation machinery enzymes, present in every cell. Glycans are the outer part of glycoproteins and form recognition elements for glycan sensor molecules that, upon recognition, mediate cellular communication. Glycan recognition plays a crucial role in cellular communication between immune cells. Dendritic cells that stimulat or inhibiting immune responses express many glycan sensor molecules. These glycan sensor molecules (called lectins) recognize specific glycans and can thereby instruct tailor made immune responses. Recognition of glycans on pathogens by dendritic cells can initiate immunological defense.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>There are approximately two hundred simple sugars found in nature but only the eight listed below are found in various combinations surrounding every single cell in the body, and are dominant ingredients in mothers\u2019 breast milk.<\/p> <p>Many of these sugars are stripped out of our modern, highly processed foods. They are also gravely missing from whole foods due to green harvesting and soil depletion. Our experience has been that the addition of these types of sugar-nutrients can have extremely positive effects on immune function and overall well-being.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>We are a society that is lead to believe that our bodies aren't capable of maintaining health and wellness on it's own, but when the immune system is able to communicate properly the body listens which makes the wellness journey not only exciting but transformational.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Workshop schedule :\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>1.

Each variety of seed is collected from individual plants that have proven to thrive year after year in the urban garden environment, with some varieties representing sixth-generation seeds.<\/p> <p>Because growing space is tight in the city, our seeds are all limited edition. \u00a0When they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone until next year.<\/p> <p><b>About Zach:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Zach Pickens is an educator, seed saver, Master Composter, and a full-time urban farmer at the Riverpark Farm at Alexandria Center.

He helped PS20 in Brooklyn design and implement a curriculum for a greenhouse education program and the eventual construction of a rooftop farm.

The workout fuses cardio, Pilates, isometric movements, plyometrics and Isometric poses into a 45-minute series. Burn between 400 and 900+ calories per hour, strengthen and sculpt infrequently used muscles, and drum your way to a leaner, slimmer physique \u2013 all while rocking out to your favorite music!<\/p> <p>Through continual upper body motion using our lightly weighted drumsticks, called Ripstix\u2122, you'll turn into a calorie-torching drummer, POUNDing off pounds as each song flies by. Rock, rap, dubstep, pop and old school music fuse to create the POUNDtrack series, which is hand-selected by music enthusiasts, drummers and POUND founders Kirsten Potenza and Cristina Peerenboom.<\/p> <p>GET RIPPED WITH RIPSTIX\u2122<\/p> <p>What would a drumming workout be without drumsticks?

Let's get to it.<\/p> <p>The World:<\/p> <p>The campaign takes place in the world of Solnarn, a magitek world similar to Eberron or World of Warcraft. The place you\u2019ll be starting off in is the city of Idris in the empire of Amtaris. Amtaris is a xenophobic human nation run by a magocratic military dictatorship. Idris is the southernmost major city of the empire and is probably the most cosmopolitan and accepting of nonhumans. It also has a high concentration of \u201cskips,\u201d people who get sucked in from other realities and are prone to popping in and out of this reality seemingly at random.<\/p> <p>To the south is the ruins of the goblin empire, which got annihilated in the last war with Amtaris. The goblins, hobgoblins, orcs, etc are now trying to rebuild some sort of life in the wreckage.<\/p> <p>To the east are a range of high mountains, beyond which is a vast desert which belongs to the Eternal Republic, a nation of elves who worship death and necromancy.<\/p> <p>Far to the north Amtaris is fighting a war against The Alliance, a group of small nations of all races desperately trying to prevent Amtaris from expanding into their lands.<\/p> <p>And to the west is the ocean and the Endless Isles, a countless number of small islands with various peoples on them.<\/p> <p>Character Creation\/Homerules<\/p> <p>This is a 5th edition campaign starting at level one. We\u2019ll probably spend the beginning of the first session on character creation. Everything in the PHB is fine except the Human Variant rule. If you want to do something outside that, let me know and we'll figure something out. Also, if you want to be from another world (like Faerun, Grayhawk, Ravenloft, etc) who got sucked into this world, that works.<\/p> <p>Also, we\u2019re going to be doing something a little different, in that I\u2019m going to incorporate a little of the FATE system into this with everybody choosing aspects. It\u2019s pretty much like the ideal\/personality trait\/flaw\/etc thing currently in 5e, but with some added gameplay mechanics to it. Your aspects are a bit about who your character is and what\u2019s important to them. They can be relationships, catchphrases, descriptors, items, or whatever that paints a picture of what you\u2019re going for with the character. When one of your aspects applies to a situation, you can invoke your aspect to gain advantage on a roll and\/or do something cool. If you\u2019re in a situation where one of your aspects could make something worse, you can compel an aspect to get disadvantage on a roll\/make something terrible happen and gain an Inspiration point.<\/p> <p>Everybody gets seven aspects, laid out as follows. The goal is for them to be interesting and capable of being both good and bad things.<\/p> <p>1. Core concept\/ideal: What your character is all about.<br\/>2. Early life trait: Something that shaped your character early in their lives.<br\/>3. Background: A more interesting way of describing the background you\u2019ve chosen<br\/>4. First adventure: Something based on whatever event inspired you to start adventuring<br\/>5. PC Bond: Something that creates a relationship between you to one of the other members of the party<br\/>6. NPC Bond: Something that creates a relationship between you to an NPC in the world.<br\/>7. Secret: An important secret that you\u2019re keeping from at least one of the other PCs.<\/p> <p>Update:\u00a0 A little more about where you guys will be starting.\u00a0 Idris and southern Amtaris experience four seasons: Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water.\u00a0 The campaign begins at the start of the Fire season, when huge waves of magical flames sweep the countryside.\u00a0 Refugees flood into the city seeking the protection of it's large walls from the flames.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Edison-Dungeons-Dragons-Meetup\/events\/224496706\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":14400000,"name":"The As Yet Unnamed Campaign of Increasingly Poor Decisions","id":"224496706","time":1440712800000,"updated":1440728714000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1421796053000,"name":"Edison Dungeons & Dragons Meetup","group_lon":-74.3600006104,"id":18359548,"urlname":"Edison-Dungeons-Dragons-Meetup","group_lat":40.5800018311,"who":"Adventurers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"845 Third Ave 20 FL","name":"Dr. Alicia Armitstead's Office","lon":-73.969749,"id":23769863,"state":"NY","lat":40.756626,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.15694403648,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439386478000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Whether you suffer from bloating, constipation, slow metabolism, heart burn, etc. come learn what you can do to help your digestion!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Healing-Arts-NYC-Meetup\/events\/224581897\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":3600000,"name":"Everything You Need to Know About Digestion","id":"224581897","time":1440712800000,"updated":1440717644000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1429180434000,"name":"Healing Arts NYC Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18550158,"urlname":"Healing-Arts-NYC-Meetup","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Health Advocates"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432923673000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Treat Yourself and Join Us For a \"SUMMER SPECIAL\" and Experience the WPN Difference. \u00a0A Summer Evening of Powerful Networking and Mastermind Session. \u00a0Where You May Meet \"The ONE\" That Will Make A Big Impact on Your Life &amp; Business. \"Brilliance, Brainstorming &amp; Breakthroughs!\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>Mastermind with Extraordinary Women with WPN's Signature Formula that Creates Amazing Results!

Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside as a backup.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

For many the flying and capture is the easy part, but sitting down with software like Final Cut Pro X or Adobe Premiere can be daunting. This 3 hour event is meant to remove the veil of mystery about video editing. How to structure, time, and edit your footage is really where the magic happens.<\/p> <p>Just because we have the tools, doesn't make us filmmakers. Our guests (to be announced) will give us real world examples of compelling aerial footage and why it works and how to incorporate filmic thought into your work.<\/p> <p>Our guest this evening is Jeff Brink, co founder of Aerocine, now Aerobo. For those not familiar, Aerobo was one of the first companies exempted and approved by the FAA to fly UAS commercially in the US. They are also the first production company to be permitted to fly in NYC.<\/p> <p>Jeff is going to deconstruct some of the videos he has cut for Aerobo and describe his process. How he sorts clips, naming conventions, storage and retrieval practices, and how he begins previsualizing a timeline.<\/p> <p>He will then demonstrate different techniques and effects providing the terminology and jargon used in editing practice culminating in the reconstructed edit of the Aerobo show reel.<\/p> <p>Jeff has also offered to take a member's raw footage and edit a short piece as we watch. If you are interested in having your raw footage transformed into an edited short piece at the event please submit a dropbox file, vimeo, or you tube link with the raw footage. Note: we aren't promising a final product. Your footage will be used to demonstrate how raw footage is winnowed down into a stellar edit.<\/p> <p>Jeff requests that the links be provided before hand so he can preview the footage and begin the previsualization process.<\/p> <p>This is not a platform specific talk, no need to bring your laptop loaded with any particular application, but an overview of the editor's process and how his methods can apply to your work. Editing is hugely time-consuming and starts with good footage. The edit, music, and titles bring the whole package together to evoke emotion.<\/p> <p>There will be ample time to socialize before and after Jeff's talk as well as Q&amp;A.<\/p> <p>This event is free and thanks in large part to the generosity of ENJOY, our hosts for the evening goenjoy.com<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCDUG\/events\/224521168\/","yes_rsvp_count":62,"duration":10800000,"name":"Video Editing Crash Course","id":"224521168","time":1440714600000,"updated":1440983358000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1330106809000,"name":"NYC\/NJ Chapter  Drone User Group Network","group_lon":-74,"id":3357852,"urlname":"NYCDUG","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Drone Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"Union Square","name":"North Pavilion - 17th st ","lon":-73.991203,"id":23951428,"state":"NY","lat":40.73587,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.980425655842,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439121008000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The North Face has joined the free fitness movement with the Mountain Athletics program.

We will start at the beginning of the mile markers which is near the exit, not near the entrance. There's parking close to the beginning of the path. If you cannot park in the lot nearest the beginning of the path, you'll need to reenter the park and park in the next closest lot. The driving area of the park is U-shaped so to get to the parking lot closest to the start of the run, you essentially drive around the \"U\" and approach the exit to the last lot on the right (by the dog park).<\/p> <p><br\/>We will start at the \"Wild Duck Pond Area\" and will turn around at some point. If you'd like to run additional miles, you are certainly more than welcome to do so as the mile markers make it simple to track your distance. Depending on the turnout we sometimes break off into little groups of two or three people, each of which may go at slightly different paces and\/or distances. Regardless, if you wish to run at a slower pace, I am more than happy to run with you at your preferred pace. Nobody gets left in the dust. This is a fun run, not a competition.<\/p> <p>For those who wish to stick around after the run, we may get together at (insert favorite Ridgewood hot spot here) to relax, catch up, and share some laughs. When we do this, we usually get to the restaurant between 7:30 and 7:45.

There is no charge for this workshop; we ask only that you commit to meeting once a month, reading the work of the other members and offering your suggestions for improvement in an upbeat, encouraging manner.<\/p> <p><b>What do we mean by \u201cadvanced writers?\u201d<\/b><\/p> <p>We mean those writers who are close to being published or have already been published in some form.

We suggest that you give us the opportunity to judge that, because we can often sense that spark of talent even if you yourself do not.\u00a0 Additionally, we have recently instituted a new member category, dubbed \u201cApprentice author\u201d--individuals who demonstrate potential but who have not yet been published anywhere or achieved commercial capability.<\/p> <p><b>Submit a Sample<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are interested in joining this kind of a close and involved group of writers, submit a sample of your writing (15 pages or less) to the group,plus a personal letter telling us a little about your background, what you are aiming for and what you think we can do for you. Your sample submission may be a play, fiction or non-fiction. If fiction, it can be a short story or a chapter of a book.\u00a0 If non-fiction, the sample can be an article or a chapter of a non-fiction book. If a play, send only Act One.<\/p> <p>If you are accepted into the group, we ask only that you encourage and support each group member by reading his or her material, critiquing it in a kindly, professional manner and attend our monthly meeting to discuss it in a group setting. There is no charge whatsoever for membership in the Advanced Writers Group.\u00a0 Our goal is to encourage more good secular writers to enter the literary marketplace.<\/p> <p>Bear in mind that once you are accepted, everyone in the group accepts that you are headed for publication; this is not a \u201clearn to write\u201d group.

There's some testimonials below, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deerspiritreiki.com\/testimonials.html\">many more on my website<\/a>. If you are coming in person please arrive at Madison Wellness by 7pm (THE DOOR WILL BE LOCKED AT 7:30PM) and pay when you arrive in cash or credit \/ debit card (don't use Paypal if you're coming in person - they take out a fee). If you are on the distant list, the energy will run from 7:45pm - 8:45pm EST. There is no conference call or video feed for the distant session, simple lie or sit down in a quiet place where you won't be disturbed from 7:45pm - 8:45pm. PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW VERY CAREFULLY IF YOU ARE REGISTERING FOR THIS EVENT! In this session we will help the group resolve self esteem issues related to self doubt. Many of us are limited by unhealthy self doubt imprints that block self self confidence and accomplishment, contentment and self acceptance. We'll spend a portion of the session targeting those imprints and release as much as we can. As usual, we'll also do a general tune up and clearing for the mind \/ body \/ emotional \/ spiritual aspects.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Registration Instructions<\/b><\/p> <p>In order to register, you must email me at [masked] stating that you are coming in person or that you want to be put on the distant list. For distant participation, give me your full name as you want it written on the distant list. Then you can Paypal me your $20 by going to the<a href=\"http:\/\/www.deerspiritreki.com\/contact.html\"> contact page<\/a> of my website and clicking on the \"Make Payment Now\" button. This will take you to my PayPal page. If you don't have a PayPal account, click on \"Don't have a PayPal account?\" on the lower right and fill in the fields with your credit or debit card info. Participants are encouraged to make a written or mental list of their intentions for the session. What do you want to heal, let go of, bring in or enhance in your life (your intentions don't have to be directly related to the theme). We don't have to know what your intentions are, we simply channel with the intent to address whatever you want and need. If you don't have specific goals for the session, just ask for \"whatever is best for me\". It's best to lie or sit down in a quiet place where you won't be disturbed for the session. Here's some testimonials -<\/p> <p><br\/><i>\"That was and still is the most amazing healing ever. My ears filled with a ringing sound so loud and my heart was pounding seemingly out of my chest.

Thanks to both of you for providing these sessions!\" KC - (distant participant in Toronto)<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\"I have gotten 3 distant group VortexHealing\u00ae sessions and I just wanted to say it is incredible how powerful it feels each time. Even the times I wasn't able to to fully concentrate and enjoy the experience, I felt such a sense of joy and upliftment wash over me when I was doing tasks and I knew this was real what I was experiencing. I suffer from depression and each session makes me feel like a child at my healthiest and happiest state, or as if I am on a very high dose of anti - depressants without the terrible side effects. It means so much to me and I just want to thank you so much - you truly have a gift!\" SB (distant participant in Toronto)<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\"The session was fabulous, afterward I felt light as a feather. It's hard to put the experience into words ... felt like my soul was being caressed\" Jane (distant participant in Montreal)<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\"Geordie - Thanks for getting back to me. I put through a \"tip\" for the session Thursday. It was very peaceful and deeply healing for me. I woke up yesterday and the virus I've been living with for the last 5 weeks had begun to clear. I'm also looking forward to the benefits I've noticed from other sessions that go on for months after!

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun.

He is one of the most known Russian stand-up comedians and character actors in the United States, who is instantly recognizable from numerous television commercials and stand-up comedy performances. Gregory immigrated to the US from Russia where he was trained in the dramatic arts, but no amount of training could prepare him for the language barrier he faced. So, after recovering from the culture shock and spending a great deal of time to learn English, Gregory resumed his comedy\/acting career in America. His character driven stand-up act presents a hilariously clever take on life as a Russian newcomer to the United States. Gregory\u2019s character always brings about the ridiculousness of his situation and sympathy for that situation that goes beyond language. His witty and insightful humor keeps the audience laughing and looking for more.<br\/>Gregory is at home in both dramatic and comedic roles. He has appeared on various TV shows including NBC\u2019s \u201c30 Rock\u201d, \u201cEd\u201d and many times in sketches on \u201cDavid Letterman\u201d and \u201cConan O\u2019Brien\u201d shows. He has done more than 60 national commercials including spots for \u201cTime Warner Cable\u201d, \u201cDirect TV\u201d, \u201cGeico\u201d, \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d, \u201cVitamin Water\u201d, \u201cVerizon\u201d, \u201cOreo\u2019s\u201d, \u201cAmstel-Lite\u201d, \u201cBMW\u201d and a \u201cSprint\u201d Super Bowl spot. His distinctive voice can be heard on the video games \u201cBully\u201d and \u201cGrand Theft Auto IV\u201d. Gregory has also appeared in several movies, including the Academy Award- nominated film \u201cExtremely Loud and Incredibly Close\u201d, starring Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock, \u201cCold Souls\u201d starring Paul Giamatti, \u201cTwo Days in NY\u201d with Chris Rock, \u201cToday\u2019s Special\u201d starring Aasif Mandvi (from the \u201cJohn Stewart show).

He is one of the most known Russian stand-up comedians and character actors in the United States, who is instantly recognizable from numerous television commercials and stand-up comedy performances. Gregory immigrated to the US from Russia where he was trained in the dramatic arts, but no amount of training could prepare him for the language barrier he faced. So, after recovering from the culture shock and spending a great deal of time to learn English, Gregory resumed his comedy\/acting career in America. His character driven stand-up act presents a hilariously clever take on life as a Russian newcomer to the United States. Gregory\u2019s character always brings about the ridiculousness of his situation and sympathy for that situation that goes beyond language. His witty and insightful humor keeps the audience laughing and looking for more.<br\/>Gregory is at home in both dramatic and comedic roles. He has appeared on various TV shows including NBC\u2019s \u201c30 Rock\u201d, \u201cEd\u201d and many times in sketches on \u201cDavid Letterman\u201d and \u201cConan O\u2019Brien\u201d shows.
