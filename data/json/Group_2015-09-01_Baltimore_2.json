        "description": "He decidido crear este grupo porque somos dos argentinos cuyos amigos son todos solteros y nos invitan a cosas de solteros, mucha mala influencia para lo que queremos construir, queremos divertirnos juntos. Nos encanta salir pero la mayor\u00eda de las veces salimos con gente soltera o solos, ya que toda nuestra familia est\u00e1 lejos. Este MeetUp es para Hispan@s que est\u00e1n casados o tienen pareja estable. El punto es pasar Buenos momentos, con mucho del buen vino, comidas caseras, futbol, asados, bailes u otras actividades que podamos descubrir juntos sobre otras culturas. Hablar espa\u00f1ol o si hay algun americano o gringo (VERY WELCOME) hablamos ambos.. Formar amistades de parejas que puedan perdurar en esta ciudad tan atareada y divertirnos a lo grande como en nuestros paises!!!",

As such we are also looking for ways to encourage young girls to become entrepreneurs. &nbsp;If this sounds like something you want to be a part of then you are welcome to join us. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you do, you will be asked to attend a minimum of 6 events per year and volunteer with us at least once a year. &nbsp;This is the only way to build a solid network and true friendships. &nbsp;Those that continually RSVP to MeetUps and do not attend will be deleted from the group. &nbsp;Those that join our Meetup group but do not attend within 2 months of joining will be deleted. &nbsp;There is no fee for membership, however, some Meetups may require payment. &nbsp;As out group grows so does the fee for hosting the Meetup group so we may from time to time limit the members to keep cost down and open up membership as needed.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that many members of this Meetup may be in Direct Sells. &nbsp;There is no recruiting allowed! Should this possibly change you will be notified. &nbsp;This is banned to make sure members are not feeling pressured to join organizations are constantly being bombarded with products and recruiting promotions. &nbsp; If someone is interested in joining your organization please meet with them outside of our activities. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Have an upcoming event or promotion and you want us to support it, please message me and request I post it on our calendar. &nbsp;However, you must be an ACTIVE member to get this perk.. Active is defined as attending the minimum amount of events and volunteering.<\/p>\n<p>Questions? Message me! &nbsp;I look forward to meeting each of you and making new business connections.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>",

We'll gather at establishments featuring great beer lists, go on local brewery tours and maybe even catch a beer festival or two.<\/p> \n<p>I started this group because I genuinely enjoy a tasty craft beer and I want to seek out where to get the best brews in the Annapolis vicinity while making new friends.<\/p> \n<p>All levels of craft beer enthusiasts are welcome but beer snobs are not! You don't have to memorize fancy beer lingo, know if \"Shake Your Money Maker\" is a song or a beer or be able to sing \"99 Bottles of&nbsp;Beer\" in tune. But, you do have to be 21 and mind your Ps and Qs.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>A few notes about this meetup group are below.&nbsp; Any questions or comments you have about this group are always welcome.&nbsp; Thank you for taking the time to check out Annapolis Brew Crew. Cheers, Courtney<\/p> \n<p>Genesis of Annapolis Brew Crew:&nbsp; Annapolis Brew Crew is version 2.0 of a \u201cBrew Crew\u201d group I had in San Diego.&nbsp; As San Diego is one of the hottest spots in the country for craft beer, there were about 20 breweries, including big ones like Stone, within about seven miles of where I lived and worked.&nbsp; The intent of my San Diego Brew Crew was to visit a new brewery the first Thursday of each month after work.&nbsp; Overtime, people wanted to join my crew but didn\u2019t like beer so we often deviated from the breweries and went to local bars that had spirits and wine.&nbsp; Basically, Brew Crew evolved into a happy hour group.&nbsp; Now that I have moved cross country, I am starting a new Brew Crew but do plan to keep this one focused on beer.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>Limited Membership: Initially, Annapolis Brew Crew will be limited to 50 members but should this group continue to flourish, I will pay additional dues to Meetup.com to expand our membership base.&nbsp; The reason for this is simply because Meetup has gotten expensive and charges the organizer based on the number of members it has.&nbsp; I don\u2019t mind paying for additional members as long as they are actively engaged in Annapolis Brew Crew so I will monitor this situation closely as our meetup group matures.&nbsp; Members who have not recently been active on the Annapolis Brew Crew site may be removed; however, if you are still interested in this Meetup, please feel free to rejoin as we\u2019d love to see you at a future event.&nbsp;<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>In modern popular usage, an epicurean is a connoisseur of the arts of life and the refinements of sensual and sexual pleasures ; epicureanism implies a love or knowledgeable enjoyment, especially of good food and drink. Because Epicureanism posits that pleasure is the ultimate good (telos), it has been commonly accepted since ancient times as a doctrine that advocates the partaking in pleasures such as intimate contact and interaction of the sexes, sexual pleasure and the pursuit of the finest in culinary dining. This group is for people that want to bring discussions of sexuality out of the shadows. Only limited by your desires to meet like minded people to talk, share knowledge, experiences and explore topics typically kept in whispers. &nbsp;It is&nbsp;for like minded individuals who desire the pursuit of sensual and sexual pleasure, especially to the enjoyment of good food and sexual comfort in a non-judgmental, safe environment. &nbsp;We will have ample opportunity at the meetups to indulge in both.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, due to the growth of the meetup, we have &nbsp;limited &nbsp;single male membership in the group. Naturally, those who are now current members will remain on the rolls, any new applicant will be placed on a waiting list until such time as the gender gap becomes more balanced; which may occur at any time. This group was designed originally to be a small group with small, intimate&nbsp;meetups, open to a balanced ratio of male female members with varying sexual preferences for friendly, fun-loving, adventurous, open-minded, sensual, and sexual experiences in the Baltimore \/ DC area. &nbsp;We have found that&nbsp;<span><span>due to many people signing up who are not serious about meeting, ONLY PEOPLE WILLING AND ABLE TO MEET INDIVIDUALLY WITH THE ORGANIZERS FOR INITIAL COFFEE\/CONVERSATION\/ETC...WILL BE PERMITTED INTO THE GROUP. We are not models; we are real people. At the same time, we are attractive, fun, and open-minded. &nbsp;Fun couples and single women with the right attitude are&nbsp;<\/span>especially<span>&nbsp;very welcome. &nbsp;Women in the group are generally bi-sexual, but it is not necessary that you are. &nbsp; If you have read all this and still think you are right for the group and the group is right for you, then join today. &nbsp;we welcome you to the world of Epicurean pleasure ............................<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

Let's get together, meet new people, and make some friends, all while having fun dining out, grabbing drinks, or whatever other social activities strike our fancy. At our core will be dining and happy hours. There are lots of fantastic food options right outside our front doors. Apparently there are over 126 food establishments in Wheaton, which gives plenty of options to get out and explore, even after dropping the various fast food joints or the mall food court. I know there are several on my list that I haven't tried yet but want too, and others that I enjoy but just don't get out and frequent enough. Then we'll see what else we want to do. Probably things like getting a group together to head to the TGIF Summer Concert Series and Taste of Wheaton events, having a cookout in Sligo Creek Park or a member's backyard, or ordering takeout or delivery for a game night or to watch a game. All while keeping it local and supporting our neighborhood establishments.<\/p>",

We will offer some professional expertise to members as needed because we realize that People do not plan to fail, they just fail to plan. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over,&nbsp;expecting different result. We are going to encourage and help each other to figure out the right way of thinking and what need to be revamped to reach our financial goals. I am looking for a group of people who are sick and tired of their current situation and looking for an avenue to let it out, have an adult conversation and talk their ways into a new way. &nbsp;We are going to explore how to make, save and accumulate money the right way. I look forward to exploring some basic financial concept to help members how to build a Strong Financial House. Knowledge is not powerful unless it is applied. Hope you can join us\"&nbsp;<\/p>",

This group is about bringing people together all walks-of-life and professions over one common interest - a really good glass of whiskey. And as most people know, some of the best business connections are made over a drink. Don't think you \"like\" whiskey straight-up? Think again. It is all about developing your pallet, and trying different ones, to find which you like the best. Let me tell you, the flavors are complex and amazing once you start to appreciate the art of it. So, if you are looking to find \"your drink,\" a newbie or pro, simply a whiskey-lover, or generally appreciate alcohol and its history, then join the Annapolis Whiskey Lovers Meetup.<\/p>",

Anyone in the group that is in need of your expertise and has availability can RSVP with you. You can work out the details after that. All members requesting to join this group must have a website or some online profile\/portfolio ahead of being accepted. This is a group for professionals who are looking to make professional connections. It\u2019s also a great group for those of us that don't have a lot of flexibility to network after hours, now you can use that hour that you were going to spend at your favorite cafe anyway, to connect with other professionals.

It is a worldwide community where individuals, companies, organizations and academia collaborate and share resources to develop any novel idea imaginable; an environment where artists, programmers, inventors, makers, investors, movie makers, engineers, scientists, and many others form teams and cross-pollinate to create a synergy not found elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><strong>At our meetings, there is something for everyone\u2026<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Those with ideas:<\/strong> We believe that the most critical resource in the idea development process is honest and direct feedback. So at every meeting we provide opportunities for up to four people\/companies to share their ideas. Preparing to communicate an idea in under five minutes encourages participants to clarify their vision, which is very helpful for pitching to investors and recruiting team members. We then break up into small groups and focus all efforts and resources on advancing the ideator towards commercialization. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Service Providers:<\/strong> Do you offer a product or service that facilitates the idea development process? Are you an expert in a particular field? Do you have experience working with service providers? If you fit into any of these categories, these meetings are an opportunity for you to shine by networking, demonstrating your knowledge and assisting other members. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Those who have NO ideas, and are NOT service providers:<\/strong> People often under-estimate their value to others, discounting a lifetime of experience, miscellaneous skills, and their roles as consumers, employees, and trendsetters. Because Innovative X is open to any idea, even obscure resources can be in great demand! Learn from what others are doing, avoid common mistakes, mingle with movers and shakers, and generate new ideas! <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;So surround yourself with creative and innovative people that are shaping our tomorrow. Attend our meetings and share ideas and experience, seek assistance and guidance in developing your own ideas, make important contacts, build or join teams to collaborate on projects, learn about new and emerging technologies and trends, and gain access to essential resources.<\/p>\n<p>Attendance is free! Be sure to check out our Central Pennsylvania and Baltimore, MD chapters! <\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><em>**Please note that our sole focus is the development of ideas and the process to make it happen. Those with no interest in this process are encouraged to pursue other, more pertinent meetup.<\/em><\/p>",

We love kids and think they are great, but we like our \"just us\" time, our ambitions, traveling, and sleeping in on weekends just a little bit more!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We welcome all dating and married couples and if you are single, too.

        "description": "<p>A women\u2019s group in this area is hard to find for women in their 40's and over 50 so I decided to establish one. I think there are a number of women in this area, who wish to meet other women with similar interest. The purpose of this group is to allow woman to come together and establish genuine friendships by socializing and communicating with each other. As women, we can come together and be supportive by sharing our experiences, both personal and professional. Activities for this group will be local outings such as movies, dining out, jazz night out, plays, concerts and outdoor events. Other activities could be a one day trip to New York, Crab Feast across the bridge or a weekend getaway. I encourage all member to make suggestions that are appropriate for this group. Meet ups can be scheduled as often as the members wish. Normally, meet ups are held one to two times a month. Each member should become involved with the group and everyone should motivate and encourage each other. The ultimate goal is to RELAX and have plenty of FUN. In order to cover the monthly meetup fee, a small yearly fee of no more than $5 will be required and any activity cost. Is this group designed for what you have in mind? If yes, you are welcomed to join us. I am excited to meet all of you ! Your Meetup Organizer<\/p>",

I've done a mix of martial arts for the last 20 years, getting instructorship in the variety of arts Tribe-K teaches. I'm not looking to start a school up here right now, and neither am I interested in joining any other school. But I would like to get some practice and share with and learn from others. This group is open to anyone wanting to learn, practice and share what they know about weapons. Training could in theory range from simple stick and knife work, to throwing knives, to firearms, depending on who wants to lead instruction. The only rule I have for this group is that you do not disparage other arts. You can think you and your system is the best, but keep it to yourself and let your actions speak louder than your words. So, Interested? Let me know, and once we get a couple people we'll find a place and start training.<\/p>",

Another purpose is to give people who primarily speak the Japanese language a chance to practice their English in a mutual exchange situation. Right now I am planning on having a Language meeting once a week, and a Culture meeting once every other week. The Language meetings will be for all levels, but probably leaning more towards beginners. If you're of Conversational level in Japanese, and would like to teach a topic relating to Japan please let me know. I would be more than happy to let you. The culture meeting will be of varying events, from Festivals to History. From Anime to JPop. If you have interest in learning something, or doing a certain event let me know a head of time, and I can try to schedule a meet up for it. Besides that let's have fun, and learn everyone.<\/p>",

We can make the unthinkable (independence from fossil fuel energy) happen - and faster than anyone would have thought! <br>With the successful strategy of divestment (against apartheid and tobacco), we can convince pension funds, universities, and any investment institution, to move its money out of fossil fuel companies and put it instead into renewable energy. <br>Students are at the forefront of this movement but there is so much to do in our communities. Let's get together and develop plans of action that will work for every one involved. <br>KICK-OFF EVENT on Friday, Feb. 13 at 5:30pm in Timonium. Please sign up! <br><a href=\"http:\/\/act.350.org\/event\/gdd\/10167\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/act.350.org\/event\/gdd\/10167<\/a><\/p>",

The girl who is not really into the club scene as much anymore (although you can still cut a rug every so often lol) and who loves brunch and wine tastings.<\/p>\n<p>In this group, I really hope to see some bonds made. As I have gotten older, it seems slightly harder to meet women and become friends. I would like to do things like, go out to eat, go to comedy shows, and brunch (of course lol). I would also like to go on day trips as well to maybe NY or the beach. All places will be easily accessible and for day trips we can carpool. Ideas are welcome, just message me. Women of all ages are welcome. Thanks!<\/p>",

We are not a Hiking Group, but we may hike. We are not a Walking Group, but we need to walk. We are a Moving Group, so Let\u2019s Move.<\/p>\n<p>This group will look to each other to keep motivated since it's easy to lose motivation noting this is the 2nd attempt at this successful group. Members should suggest things to do or even host events themselves. Hiking , walking, shopping, dancing, &nbsp;healthy eating, trails, community center classes, joint- meetups, etc. \u2026. the organizer is game. Everyone moves at the pace that is comfortable to them. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are fast or slow. The slow ones will be encouraged to move as fast as the fast ones and the fast ones will be encouraged to keep striving forwarded or they might end up like the slow ones :-) If you are trying something new, you should consult your doctor 1st. Your safety is important to us and it should be to you too.<\/p>\n<p>So if you\u2019re on a journey to be more active, and don\u2019t mind pulling people along who are losing motivation, this group is for you. Let's shout it loudly : While the organizer is a couch potato, there are fitness buffs in the group. This group just asks for you to be courteous of other people\u2019s time planning and showing up to events by not having no-shows or last minute cancelations.<\/p>\n<p>The Let\u2019s Move Campaign isn\u2019t the reason the group started but it was one of the driving factors.&nbsp;Non-Moms do the \u201cMom Dance\u201d just as much <\/p>\n<p><a class=\"embedded\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Hq-URl9F17Y\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Hq-URl9F17Y<\/a><\/p>\n<p> Let's stop talking or thinking about what we are going to do and let's start doing it.

Come to our events and meet members of the Friendship Force of the National Capital Area (Washington, DC area) and hear our stories of our adventures. As part of our club, you can meet people of other countries and cultures by staying in their homes while visiting their country, by hosting them in your home, or by simply meeting them at events we hold during their visit. We share meals, conversation and the routines of daily life, creating a unique cultural encounter and lasting friendships. When we visit or host another club, the club organizes a program of activities to introduce the visitors to the local area (for us, this can include visits to museums, the Capitol, nearby cities such as Annapolis, and more). Our Friendship Force club is affiliated with Friendship Force International, which was founded in 1977 with the mission \"to promote global understanding across the barriers that separate people.\" There are 375 clubs in 60 countries on six continents. Most of our members live in Virginia, Maryland, the District of Columbia. We hold events throughout the metropolitan area, such as dinners or brunches in restaurants, pot-luck meals at various locations, a swim party\/picnic, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Find out more about our club at ffnca.org or on our Facebook page at www.facebook.com\/FriendshipForceNationalCapitalArea.

We believe that one of the true joys of loving something- whether it's a good movie, a fun card game, or an admirable superhero- is meeting friends who share your enthusiasm for it. On Saturdays we host free board game night from 5-9 pm, casual Magic The Gathering 1-6 pm, and D&amp;D 12-5 pm. Wednesdays we have HeroClix 6-9 pm. And, of course, we have casual games throughout the week!",

        "description": "<p>Hi...thanks for checking out this group! I wanted to join a meet up group to meet other moms and friends for my little guy, but it seems like most of the groups for toddlers meet during the week. I am a single, full-time working momma so that just doesn't work for us. Me and my son love getting out of the house during the weekend and going on new adventures (hey even a trip to the park is an awesome adventure for a 20 month old!). So I thought why not create my own meet up group and invite other moms and their little ones to join us?! This group is for toddler age kids and their moms. My son is VERY active (I'm sure the other boy moms out there can relate?;)) so most of the activities we will do will let the kids be kids (play, run around, have a generally grand time). We'll also have holiday themed activities (I LOVE pretty much every holiday!), Mom's night out events (This group will stay fairly small so we can all get to know each other) and when it gets warmer stroller walks and lots of other outdoor activities (YAY for warmer weather!). So if this sounds like something you'd be interested please join up! We'd love to have you! *But please only join the group if you are intending to come out to events. The group will be limited to 50 people so we want to let the ones who are going to come join. Thanks! :)<\/p>",

        "description": "I love reading books that give me a sense of empowerment, make me feel inspired and give me the keys to ALLOWING a happier life. And then I want to chew on those concepts with others and hear about all the increased joy they\u2019re feeling! Some self helps books use terminology that is not a perfect match to how would describe something, but their intentions are all quite the same anyway. I just take what I can get from them, allowing them to clarify the beliefs I find to be most valuable. _______________________ The format for this book club could be that we choose one specific book to read and then discuss. But if folks would prefer just bringing in ANY book they\u2019re currently reading and discussing any way in which it makes them FEEL BETTER - that\u2019s fine too. I\u2019m going to host the first few meetings at my house, until another member of the group feels comfortable hosting at hers - so we can be most comfortable and hear each other (which is often hard in a public place). _________________ If you\u2019d like to read a book in common, for our first meeting, may I suggest: \"How to Rule the World From Your Couch\" - this is basically about using the massive leverage of intuition before you take physical action. Great stuff. You know how science says we're only using 10% of our brains? After reading this book, I had moments where I felt like I was using my brain in a whole different way and - making a difference - from my couch! Find it here, http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/How-Rule-World-Your-Couch\/dp\/1439123586\/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424790943&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=How+to+Rule+the+World+From+Your+Couch And soon after, let\u2019s read this - I loved it!

You have a job (or you're a student), a car, and you live in a decent place. You may or may not be new to Baltimore. You've tried the typical MeetUp gigs, but aren't satisfied with the large get-togethers and people you've met there. You're looking for a genuine, reliable set of friends that you can be yourself around and enjoy good times with. You want to try a variety of activities and are tired of the same-old bar scene. All of your friends are coupled and difficult to get a hold of. You want to meet other singles who do what you do, and you'd like to get to know a small group of people steadily, over time. Perhaps you're coupled yourself, but want to get out and develop your own social circle independent of your partner's. You don't have any spectacular talents, but you're an interesting person and have a desire for a strong, fun social base.<\/p>\n<p><span>If this sounds like you, then BMFSG is your kind of MeetUp. Our get-togethers are generally limited to a few people, so you can get to know those you spend time with. Our goal is to&nbsp;create a fun, welcoming atmosphere where people can establish meaningful connections with each other, enjoy good conversation, and just hang out and enjoy life. We are LGBTQ-friendly.&nbsp;<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>IF YOU'RE A STUDENT . . .<\/b><\/p>\n<p>You will find this group helpful in meeting study buddies to stay motivated, keep accountable, and share cafe time with. As a doctoral fellow myself, I routinely post study sessions at various Baltimore coffeeshops. This will get you out of your house, into the city, and mingling with people while you put together that bibliography or crunch those numbers. Who ever said scholars needed to stay cooped up at home?<\/p>\n<p><b>IF YOU WORK . . .<\/b><\/p>\n<p>You will find a diverse outlet for your social needs here, since you will be mixing with people from all walks of life. Our group will help you branch out from your typical work colleagues and spend time with people doing other interesting things with their lives. This will provide you with a greater sense of variety, balance, and satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p><b>WHERE DO WE MEET?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Our events will be all around the Charm City, and possibly even in nearby Annapolis. We encourage members to suggest events, and will be considering new ideas regularly. Don't worry: this is not some sort of support group. It's simply for people who recognize that they have had trouble making friends and would like to do something about it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>REQUIREMENTS: AGE, PHOTO, QUESTIONS<\/b><\/p>\n<p>BMFSG only accepts members between the ages of 21 and 35. You must also have a photo of yourself in your profile and answer our group's questions so that we know something about you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>",

Whether you are a seasoned swimmer or a casual dipper, its always more fun to workout with a group (in my opinion). So lets meetup and go for a swim! For those of you who like to supplement their workout with a frosty beer and some tots, we will meet at Public Bar Tenley right off Wisconsin Ave afterwards so we can all get to know each other. Details: The Wilson Aquatic Center is free for anyone with a D.C. driver\u2019s license or DC one card. Don\u2019t have either? Don\u2019t fret! The center can make DC One Cards right above the swimming area. Check http:\/\/octo.dc.gov\/page\/dc-one-card for what you should bring with you when registering for a card. Wilson Aquatic Center: 4551 Fort Dr NW Washington, DC 20016 Closest Metro: Tenleytown (Red Line) Public Bar Tenley: 4611 41st St Washington, DC 20016 Closest Metro: Tenleytown (Red Line)",

If you always travel with your kids but want to do some mom or dad getaways with like-minded people, this group is for you. We'll meet to create our travel vision board and transform our dreams into goals and our goals into actions. We'll learn tips on how to travel for less so that we can travel more often. We are not going to be pitched by travel agents but rather work on designing the best vacations that work for us and our families' needs. Later down the line, we'll also plan group getaways, trips, and learn about destinations in fun and unique ways.",

Meetings are held monthly in the founders home in Kensington\/Silver Spring, MD every 2nd Sunday of the month from 5:00-7:00+. Everyone brings a dish and we discuss that month's book over dinner. Our group is mostly divorced women 50+ with a shared love of not only the well written word, but the arts too (theater, galleries, good movies, music, PBS) and those interested do some  of those things together as well. Some of us are also artists or crafts women doing creative projects like knitting, quilting, crocheting, beading, jewelry making, painting, etc.). However, the important thing we all have in common is our appreciation of really good literature, well written books that inspire, and our yearly picks include no \"fluff\". So, this is a great group for serious readers (not that some of us don't read mysteries, suspense, non fiction, etc. on the side too). \nWe look forward to knowing you, however, because we meet in the founders  home, she will contact you directly  and ask you to call her so you can talk a bit first. Warm Regards.\n\n ",

Are you longing for a better way to address society's pressing challenges? This discussion group is based on the idea that it can be possible to find common ground across the political spectrum if we can gain a better understanding of each others perspectives through face to face dialogue. People of all political stripes who are open-minded and curious are welcome. The objectives are to 1) bring together participants with diverse political views, 2) conduct a respectful and productive conversation about a difficult topic in a safe environment, and 3) explore possible areas of common ground. To promote these goals, discussions will be loosely structured around a format called \u201cLiving Room Conversations\u201d (see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.livingroomconversations.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.livingroomconversations.org\/<\/a>), which has been successful in finding common ground between groups as politically disparate as the Tea Party and MoveOn.org. An inaugural meeting is planned for the evening of March 20. To join the conversation or find out more, contact Keith.Kozloff@verizon.net.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>In this group we aim to reformulate and unify all knowledge, including ontological mathematics, cosmic evolution, the universal dialectic and ethics into a coherent framework. Since, by definition, existence cannot come from non-existence, an accurate understanding of reality itself requires the acceptance of an \u201cArche\u201d, an eternal and fundamental basis of reality in a constant state of becoming. Aristotle postulated such reality as a conversion of potential into actuality in an all-encompassing process termed \u201cEntelechy\u201d. This perspective allows for a pivotal understanding of life, intelligence and the divine as evolutionary events occurring along a continuum. God is traditionally viewed as the pinnacle of intelligence, power, and complexity, but existence cannot begin with such qualities. Rather, the universe evolves in complexity over time: it was not created by God, but is God <i>in potentia<\/i>. Thus we can propose a unification of science and religion in which a creator God is a logical impossibility, but God as the end-product of cosmic evolution is logical. The Universe is converting infinite potential into maximum actualization; and we are participants in the entire process, which is perhaps the ultimate meaning of life.<\/p>",

Depending on who wants to meet up---I can think of a million things we could do! We could take documentary pictures, arty pictures, look for particular people, delve into genealogy, read up on the history of cemeteries in Baltimore and cemeteries in general, read and talk about cultural attitudes toward death, (potentially) clean up neglected cemeteries, make friends and learn about the flora and fauna, geek out about sculptors and trends and symbols in mortuary sculpture, get in touch with our inner teenage goth(s), prowl around aimlessly, etc. There are such great cemeteries here, all full of great art and history and green space.<\/p>\n<p>I promise I am not a weird person.&nbsp;<\/p>",

WE WILL BE A SISTERHOOD, UPLIFTING AND INSPIRING EACH OTHER. THERE IS NOT ANY ROOM IN THIS GROUP FOR ANY UNNECESSARY DRAMA. I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING MY NEW FRIENDS:)<\/p>",

This group is focused toward traditional acoustic musicians who enjoy playing and learning together. All are welcome to attend even if you are just there to listen and enjoy the time with friends and family. We ask that the musicians at the jam abide by a few rules. We will only allow Traditional bluegrass instruments - Acoustic 6 String Guitar, Mandolin, Fiddle, Dobro, Upright Bass, and 5 String Banjo. Harmonicas are okay too if you can really play it! Also, acoustic bass is okay if you can't bring the upright. While all are welcome at this jam we will be playing some intermediate to advanced bluegrass. Don't let this scare you away! We are more than willing to slow it down too. This is a chance to have fun and pick together as a community, this is not a contest to see who the fastest flat picker is. This jam is set in a family environment so we ask that you please respect this and conduct yourself appropriately. The final say in what will and won't be allowed at the jam lies with the organizer. We look forward to seeing you!<\/p>",

The kind of camera you have will not matter. I believe you can create a great portrait with the best camera around or a cell phone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You should &nbsp;know how to work your camera. There are many other factors such as backgrounds, clothing and the message you want to convey that go into creating a portrait. Those will all be addressed as needed or in a separate class. The classes are for people who want to improve their people portraits. Anyone can pick up a camera these days and take a photo but to take a portrait to the next level requires more thought, understanding and a lot of practice. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I'd like to see how the group evolves, but for now we'll&nbsp;get together on location, near Silver Spring, Bethesda and NW and learn about natural portrait posing and lighting. Sometimes we will go for an urban look and other times we might go to a park. We will look for lighting situations that mimic studio lighting without lighting equipment (except maybe a reflector). We will pose each other as singles, couples and groups and occasionally we'll have a model. Next fall I may teach studio portraits. Most of the time we'll meet on Saturday morning and be done before noon. <br><\/p>\n<p>I look forward to sharing with you.

        "description": "<p>Are you interested in learning more about Qigong energy healing? This group is for promoting health and wellness through an ancient practice called QiGong. What is Qigong? Qigong focuses on improving physical health and wellness. It opens the energy flow within the body by eliminating blockages. The intent is to balance the body by opening the energetic pathways (meridians). This is accomplished by a series of gentle movements synchronized with the breath. This form of Qigong can be safely practiced by the beginner, with limited movement, to the most advanced student. It benefits all students and aides them in moving forward no matter what their prior experiences. Each class is started with a set of Opening Moves to allow the body structure to open in all directions. Next, we move through the Qigong movements. These movements focus on Energy passing through specific pathways (or meridians). The class ends with a closing Qigong form that integrates the mind-body-spirit to a more grounded state of well-being. Qigong is an excellent tool to acquire mind-body-spirit awareness. Its movements provide a path toward personal transformation. Each individual may have a different experience each time they practice the form. The goal is as they work toward balance of the Yin-Yang Qi they will notice improved health, increased energy and a greater awareness of life. What are the benefits? Qigong enhances immune function, reduces the ill effects of stress, prevents disease, calms the mind and emotions, lowers blood pressure, increases flexibility, cultivates energy, treats chronic pain, and improves sleep.<\/p>",

We have created this wholistic-focused veterans interest group to build a support network of veterans and veteran spouses who are passionate, motivated and energized to mastermind and act in loving support to veterans. This is a space for those who are ready to make a serious impact in, thereby changing, the way service is delivered in the veteran community. Veterans - our very own families and friends - are grieving, homeless, hungry, traumatized. Together we will wholistically 1) mastermind\/have open table-top discussions on the issues so that we can create\/develop activities such as workshops, food programs, presenting at various venues, fund raise, item raise, item distribution, outdoor sport and other events;&nbsp; and 2) act - implement and carry forward these activities.<\/p>\n<p>VETers may be interested in helping to strengthen the organization by joining the Board of Directors, Advisory Board or other committee. Any funds raised are tax deductible to the donor and 100% benefit to VFS. VETers will meet once per month for starters. Let's get together in continuation of service. <\/p>\n<p>Visit our website here <a href=\"http:\/\/veteransforeversoldiers.org\/\">http:\/\/veteransforeversoldiers.org\/<\/a><\/p>\n<br>\n<br>",

        "description": "<p>Hey hey! Thanx for checking out The Black Rainbow. This group is for African American lesbians (and gays) under 30 in the Baltimore City area whom are interested in building an overall more positive and productive queer community through artistry and civil engagement.<\/p> \n<p>Well what (tf) does that mean?<\/p> \n<p>Well, a few things. The term \"Black\" was originally defined as \"the absence of color\". On the contrary: Black is the Queen of all colors; it is the accumulation of all colors. That being said, this group is for young black lesbians and gays that are multi-faceted in their interests and habits; crave the company of other lesbians and gays that contradict, or go against, the stereotypes of our community; people interested in creating more social events -whether dance, poetry, art, food, or just a chill get-together at a house with some good conversation (and good treats \ud83c\udf32+\ud83c\udf78**). The in-house gatherings will also consist of general group discussion. Topics will vary, but some include:<\/p> \n<p>- Is there a difference between a \"dyke\" and a lesbian or \"faggy\" and a gay male?<br>- What's \"gay\" in the gay community? (s4s)<br>- Lipstick fems to hard butches and all that falls between (fem, ag fem, ag\/dom\/stud, soft stud, stem, etc.)<br>- Where does \"drama\" come from and why is it so prevalent in our community?<br>- Does \"conversion therapy\" really work?<br>- Who wears the pants? (Looking at the need\/desire for a \"dominant\" role in a relationship)<\/p> \n<p>Also, while this isn't a \"hookup\" group, you could quite possibly find the one for you. Once you're around some folk on a similar wave length, you're bound to bump into someone on your frequency.<\/p> \n<p>In addition, while there is an emphasis for a particular demographic, THIS GROUP FULLY SUPPORTS ALL OTHER LGBTQIA MEETUP GROUPS IN AND AROUND BALTIMORE (Shout out to Women of Color - great group with a similar focus)<\/p> \n<p><br>As of now, there are very few to no places or events for young black queers to come together, other than a club (hippo) or a party. Much of the \"drama\" that so many of us detest, in some part, comes from the lack of options we have to choose from as a community that reflect the variety of styles and interests within. Meaning, there seems to be a thick line drawn in the sand between people who love the club and people who hate it. Yet this separation completely discounts the multitude of young black queers that may like to hit the club (or nah) AND do other stuff. The \"other stuff\" tho, seems to be almost non existent. The Black Rainbow is ultimately for young queers of color to, in effect, be the change we want to see. Theres way too many of us in the city to be so separated. Maybe im enthusiastic because im not from here, but try not to kill the dream and just live it with me for a while.<\/p> \n<p>Let's MEETUP, share some ideas and see if we can't create a entirely new culture for ourselves right here.<\/p> \n<p>I AM ALSO LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL ORGANIZERS.<\/p> \n<p>**footnote: this group is 420\/alcohol friendly, but promotes use in moderation. Each individual is responsible for his\/her own actions and will be asked to remove him\/herself if he\/she forgets what MODERATION means and intoxication makes him\/her a problem. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO NEGATIVITY ALLOWED (sounds extreme, i know, but you know our people and you give some an inch...)<\/p>",

My daughter was born with a condition in which she has required many surgeries, long hospital stays, and has feeding difficulties.  She has a feeding tube.  All of this can be overwhelming and difficult for others to understand.  This group will provide a time to connect and share stories.   Some of the meetings will just be with the moms, others will be with the children too.  Looking forward to meeting you!",

The purpose of this is to draw membership from the Maryland area, as we sometimes have events there as well as in DC.\n\n____________________________\nWe are a tradition of Witchcraft based in the DC\/NOVA\/MD area. Our meetup is the container for what we call the \"outer circle\" of participants and members. We are facilitated by a governing coven called Coven of the Spiral Moon, the \"inner circle.\" We put on public rituals for many of the sabbats as well as a number of classes on various Wiccan and Witchcraft-related topics. We are also a Wiccan tradition that people can participate in casually, or through the deeper path of initiation into the outer circle or one of our two coven's. All respectful individuals are welcome to engage in this Great Work of evolving our souls, growing in power, and becoming attuned with this holy Earth.",

What if that same light could talk to appliances throughout your home? What if data transfer rates were up to 10Gbps? That scenario is no longer confined to the imagination: it's a reality! LiFi, or visible light communications (VLC), is a method of transmitting data using visible light, and viable prototypes mean this technology is on the cusp of hitting the mainstream.

Don't consider yourself an \"artist\"? Don't worry - this is a \"come as you are\" type group with all ranges of skill. We work in an \"Art Jam\" format - meaning we go to a location and work on individual projects. Occasionally, we will have a structured class as requested (or offered by members). Locations will vary but will often be outdoors in good weather. We are also family friendly. The organizer will often be bringing her toddler along to scribble - and other young friends are welcome!<\/p>",

I live in Hyattsville near University Avenue and as you know significant change is coming with the Purple Line. I think there is a great opportunity here to carve out a space for developing artists who are not in a position to commit to renting a studio space full-time. Hopefully, this group can come together and acquire a large studio space that nurtures interest in this ancient art. Maybe this can segue into developing an artspace for other crafts like spinning, ceramics, glassmaking, etc.",

We can all work together cooperatively towards creating our homestead by growing food; including fruit trees, greens and other vegetables, herbs, berries, grapes, etc...  We can learn to live harmoniously together by implementing NVC (Non Violent Communication) and other effective and beneficial tools for communicating and relating in a healthy respectful way.  We can build our Eco structures on the land so there's no mortgage.  We can use compost toilets.  We can work from home to make incomes and live close to nature.  We can raise our children together so there's less overwhelm.  I started this meeting because I'm looking for other people to do this with .. To create community,, to support actualizing our ideas and visions",

        "description": "<p>Sonja Secrets celebrates the opening of a new Holistic Healing Facility with a Meet and Greet Today, we all suffer from various conditions, be it stress or diabetes or heart-disease. We are moving too fast for our own good, and our bodies are paying for that. In the last few years, a new trend has emerged, that of holistic healing which uses a combination of various techniques to calm you down and to help you get rid of these diseases. Indeed, Holistic Healing has been proven to eradicate several diseases, which is why Maria is opening a new Holistic Healing facility. There are various sub-sects of holistic healing, and Maria Talton specializes in healing with chakras and special gemstones. Now what are chakras? Well, your body is a vessel of energy. Positive energy and negative energy, and sometimes this balance is upset due to certain life events. Now the concept of chakras is that there are different parts of your body corresponding to different kinds of negativity, and chakra healing basically revolves around these chakras, to act on the chakras that correspond to your problems. That's a very brief explanation, however, as there's a lot more to chakras. Now, when as for the gemstones, they have been used for centuries worldwide for treating ailments, for purifying oneself and for various other purposes. By placing gemstones in certain areas of the body for certain periods of time, you can rid yourself of ailments. Now Maria, after perfecting her holistic learning techniques has decided to commemorate the opening of her new facility, for which she is hosting a meet and greet where people can meet with the staff, schedule meetings, explore the facility, get knowledge on various holistic learning programs and much, much more. Any doubts that you have on holistic learning can be answered by Maria and by several other practitioners who will be present there. This meet and greet is taking place on the third of May from 12 noon to 5 in the evening at 14300 Gallant Fox Lane Suite 225 Bowie, Md. Those wishing to attend have to pay an entry fee of $25 per person, and as an appreciation of their visit, everyone will get a personal gift. Lite Fare will be provided. Those willing to know more can visit Maria's website, at sonjasecrets.com, or you can also contact her directly at 202-718-2753 .<\/p>",

        "description": "Hello, everyone! I am a student at the University of Maryland School of Social Work In Baltimore, MD. I get the sense there are a lot of neat people at UMB, but I never get the chance to run into them unless they go to the social work school and happen to be in my classes (well, the library, too, I guess, but I mostly just study there and then leave). So, i figured I would make a group for UMB students to serve as a social and proofessional networking group! It is open to current students, people who just got accepted to one of the schools and in enrolling, or recent alumni (by recent I mean people who graduated within 2-3 years). I wanted to make a fun social outing group that also allows for people to mingle and build up some professional connections- it's who you know, as they always say. I was thinking we could do anything from just grabbing lunch at one of the restaurants near the school, having study sessions at the library, going out to Fells or wherever for a fun night out, or anything anyone else would like to suggest! There is no age limit, everyone who meets the criteria I listed above is welcome to join! I do filter the group to make sure just that you are a student or recent alumni, but besides that, you'lll definitely be accepted into thte group. Thanks again, everyone!",

We go to events and play dates, take day trips to DC and Philly and visit libraries and playgrounds often! However, I would like us both to do those things with others and develop friendships along the way! If you're an active single parent who wants to develop new friendships, this is the group for you!

We believe this is the only documentary film series in Baltimore that is open to the public and free of charge. (We appreciate and encourage donations, but they're optional).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We purchased a license from the Motion Picture Licensing Corporation. <br> <br>Always on the fourth Wednesday of the month at 6:30 pm in downtown Baltimore. You can see the upcoming films here: <a href=\"http:\/\/baltimoreethicalsociety.org\/programs-activities\/film-series\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/baltimoreethicalsociety.org\/programs-activities\/film-series\/\">http:\/\/baltimoreethicalsociety.org\/programs-activities\/film-series\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span>The current batch of upcoming films are all all academy award nominees - or winners. &nbsp;After the viewing, we'll have a discussion, usually with a local expert or advocate on the particular topic to lead the discussion. <br><br>The series is hosted by the Baltimore Ethical Society in a beautiful viewing space, with free street parking. &nbsp;Refreshments (beverages and snacks) are free, and other food is available for purchase. We'll take food orders (delivery pizza, etc?). &nbsp;We can eat while we watch. &nbsp;So bring a couple of bucks in case you get hungry. <br> <br>We'll also use this site to announce a separate discussion series, without films, on Sunday mornings at 10:30 am in the same location. Also with food, and also free of charge. &nbsp; These are presentations by local experts or advocates on a topicial issue, followed by Q &amp; A. &nbsp;These Sunday presentations are preceded by an introduction and brief announcements by the Baltimore Ethical Society, and followed by Q &amp; A, then time to mingle, to enjoy snacks, and&nbsp;to speak with the presenter.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>",

I started this group because my fianc\u00e9 is joining Army JAG, and I noticed that even though DC has a large military community, I couldn't find any support for younger military spouses like myself. Looking forward to meeting others like me and forming a community!",

Are you a single black woman in her mid to late thirties who has realized that everyone around you has kids and\/or married and you feel left out? You often find yourself the only one at events with no kids and husband, maybe a boyfriend. It's fun chilling and spending time with our boyfriends, but every woman needs good girlfriends too. Men don't always want to do what we want to do.&nbsp;Do you often find yourself not having many girlfriends or&nbsp;female relatives&nbsp;to hang out with&nbsp;any more because they have relocated, gotten married, have&nbsp;mommy duties or have a certain time to be home.&nbsp;Do you sometimes&nbsp;find yourself sitting at home on a beautiful sunny day with no girlfriends&nbsp;to chill with. Or on a weekend night watching Lifetime, LMN&nbsp;or Bravo? Do you just want to be spontaneous sometimes and just call and&nbsp;say let's go out or do something fun?&nbsp;This group is for heterosexual, Christian, &nbsp;professional, classy, intelligent, positive and drama-free and like-minded women that are seeking to socialize and build true lasting friendships that will develop into a sisterhood. This will be a small group to foster a close knit and engaging atmosphere. The group will consist of women that are supportive, encouraging, inspirational and uplifting&nbsp;to one another. Let's engage in some awesome activities, while developing bonds and making memories that will last a lifetime. Some of the activities include: dining, brunch, lounges,&nbsp;cruises, festivals, concerts, plays, broadway musicals, live bands, weekend getaways, movies, spas, picnics and day trips. Having&nbsp;children or getting married doesn't define you,&nbsp;they enhance your life. We never know what God has in store for us. Until then,&nbsp;let's live our lives and enjoy us until we do get married and become moms.&nbsp;If you are interested in meeting other wonderful, like-minded ladies to explore the DMV and so much more, please join this group. I understand that sometimes you won't be able to attend every outing, but please be an active participant to make this group a success. This is not just a meetup but friendship group. Constant no shows will lead to the member being deleted from the group.<b>&nbsp;Currently this group is closed to new members.<\/b><\/p>",

Whether your a skateboarder, a therapist, a DIY enthusiasts, a sign flipper, a bi-lingual translator, or a first lady, let's commit to honoring the Kingdom and God's word by intentional servanthood to others in the world. Sure, we have differences and we may not see \"eye to eye\" but, if we can accept one another \"as is\", we have already won the first battle of conformity and tradition. Let's agree to meet in order to walk\/work together for the purpose of accomplishing God's Will.&nbsp; To create revolving strategies by translating the Living Word of God into creative action and imagery, it is very important to \"Tell us about yourself\". Please communicate your talents, gifts, skills, knowledge, personality, etc., that will best project your God given abilities and capacity to show God's love to others.&nbsp; To display these \"Actions\/Acts\" of God's Love to others in the general public, we aim to meetup once a month to actually do the hands on work, which will be the result of putting some presentations in rotation and developing a good flow among members. Occasionally, expect an extra meetup to strategize new actions afforded to us by the Holy Spirit, the needs of the people, and communities we serve. Even in our common interaction, as a group, in public we can represent The Love of God by also engaging in discipleship, fellowship, and showing others that Christians are fun, loving, and creative outside of our spiritual comfort zones and associates. We welcome all Believers in God and His Word, who have a heart for God, and who want to serve people with their talents, time, and resources. God's will be done! <br><\/p>\n<p>Disclosure: The meeting locations are tentative and up for discussion depending on the members who join.&nbsp; The group is designed to be a mobile christian based street outreach that combines discipleship and team-building in the body of Christ, To enable us to be laborers in the harvest (plant, plow, sow, seed, water, etc.,) and pour out the name of Jesus in the our streets and other public platforms. <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLxQ8hpRHFePIaVZb_ccFu3YS3fMDG9UNy\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLxQ8...<\/a> <br><\/p>",

        "description": "Hey! So I noticed there are some groups for people in their 20's and 30's to mingle and what not, but I didn't really see a ton specifically for dating...or going out and dancing. I enjoy night life, especially just going out with some friends and dancing and having a couple drinks. I figured I would start a meetup group that was geared towards guys and gals in their 20's to meet up, meet each other, mingle, have fun, and see if anything happens from there! Dating and finding good people to match up with you can be difficult, so I wanted to try this out!",

It is not simply a polar discussion of whites and blacks only as there are many other groups affected by racism in different ways, so we will incorporate discussion of other racial or ethnic groups into the discussion as well. Everyone's voice is valid and as a result we will operate the discussion of these topics in a manner similar to AA groups in which no one may vocalize his\/her opinions of another person's comments so that everyone may feel secure in sharing their opinions.<\/p>",

I am a DC Medical Marijuana Patient, a part-time student, a part-time writer for DOPE magazine and I want to gather the best of growers, scientists, activists, patients, entrepreneurs, and simply those with DOPE knowledge to share for meetups to discuss Cannabis and plan activities where we can smoke, drink, eat some nice local food, feel safe, and maybe even learn some stuff. Its about time D.C. unites to Act Up and create a welcoming Cannabis Community for all to feel safe despite age, race, creed, color, political affiliation, sexuality, gender, and everything else I haven't thought of. Come join me and be part of the bright horizon. ",

I was the organizer of the Clarksville Gay &amp; Lesbian Meet-up Group many years ago and had to give it up due to time constraints. I have started this group with a slightly different purpose.&nbsp; This is a group for those of us who have lost our true love\/soul mate or may be still single and struggling to find the right person to build a life with. You can be&nbsp;looking for friends,&nbsp;a first true love, or widowed like me, trying to recapture the joy of two people living as one with&nbsp;love, conviction, and&nbsp;the kind of happiness and bliss that only exists when soul mates find each other. Through this group we can plan relaxing get togethers so that&nbsp;lonely souls can collide in a safe and relaxing way with others who are also searching for their better half. (Happy couples are also welcome to join.) <\/p>",

Our center is located at 424 Fourth Street in Annapolis. We gather six times a week to study and practice: we recite traditional chants, practice various meditation techniques, discuss traditional texts, and more.&nbsp;Please take a look at our ongoing calendar for upcoming meetups.<br><br><b>ABOUT THE CENTER<\/b><br><br>The Gampopa Center was founded in 2009 in Annapolis, Maryland, by Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche based on the Buddhist understanding that the teachings of Buddha can bring us peace, happiness, and freedom. Lama\u2019s students were excited to welcome a qualified Tibetan Buddhist teacher into the community and wanted to provide a place for learning and practicing Dharma.&nbsp;<br><br>As a growing community of lay Dharma practitioners, we are grounded in but not limited to the Karma Kagy\u00fc lineage. The Center consists of a small shrine room, and we are actively looking to enlarge our facility.<br><br><b>ABOUT OUR MAIN TEACHER<\/b><br><br>Our community is grateful for the opportunity to learn and practice under the direction of an authentic, accomplished guide, Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche.&nbsp;<br><br>Born in Tibet in 1973, he is a monk, scholar, and author. The Dalai Lama and the Seventeenth Gyalwang Karmapa have glowingly endorsed his book&nbsp;<i>The Lamp of Reasoning and Scriptures of the Sage, the Buddha<\/i>.&nbsp;<br><br>He has completed a traditional three-year retreat under the guidance of the Very Venerable Bokar Rinpoche, who subsequently appointed Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche to be a three-year-retreat teacher. He has received advanced Buddhist training from masters in India, Sikkim, and Nepal. Now a citizen of the United States, Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche makes his home in Annapolis, Maryland.<br><br>______________________________________<br><br><i>The Gampopa Center has an open door policy. Friends and members are welcome to come and go as you wish. While we do not charge for most sessions, you are welcome to make a donation if you are so moved.<\/i><\/p>",

I believe in the power of the testimony (our own true story) and we will also use this as an opportunity to help hurting women who may be faced with the same decision presently or gave into abortion in the past.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>I am a practicing Christian. Although I am so, this group is open to any woman of any race, culture, or faith as long as and individual doesn't act in a unmannerly manner towards another. Expect to be built up, encouraged, to learn to heal and forgive ourselves and others about the decisions we made. Let's dry our silent tears and live a full life, realizing our decisions of the past don't define who we really are.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Outside of community service, we will have many opportunities to fellowship and go on outings and day\/weekend trips. Look forward to an atmosphere of freedom, release, and joy. Join us.<\/span><br><\/p>",

There are three rules: 1) We walk at a moderate pace, slow enough to see the scenery and to chat but not so slow we are not getting exercise and keeping a good pace. 2) We leave no one behind. 3) We stop as a whole group, every so often, to catch our breath. We will not have a group of fast walkers stop and rest and as soon as the slow walkers catch up, they take off, leaving the slower group never catching a break!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Please let us know if you are coming on a walk\/hike, but if you can't make it, don't worry about saying that you are not coming! If you change your mind, change your RSVP.<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>Looking forward to a great group of folks to walk\/hike with!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>Pat<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>",

We'll post about opportunities to get off your couch and out of your house. Mainly we can get together and play softball and sign up for leagues together or bring our friends. Also we can discuss facilities, rules, and new ideas. Im also super pumped about socializing with some fellow Softball players around our great city! Softball is the perfect mix of healthy competition and laid back attitudes, so lets do this!!!<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Are you a small business owner looking to get your business online? Do you have a website? If so, does your website have analytics so you can evaluate your traffic and optimize for new customers or clients? Do you have social media set up to interact with your customers? If not, it's time to get into the game! Let's meetup and iron these things out... changes are, you're going to profit from this time.<\/p>\n<p>I meet many small business owners that are looking for support, and hiring a professional would cost $250\/hour easily. If we can get together, share from our experiences of what we did that worked, and what didn't work, and where we are stuck someone else may have overcome.<\/p>\n<p>This is an open source place for information sharing fro small business owners, or anyone looking to launch their online presence.<\/p>\n<p>The knowledge you will gain from this group is well worth more than the dues. Installing google analytics on your website is easily a $250 task. With this group, you get a whole month of support in a community to network with as you go along.<\/p>",

Do you not want to be on a tour bus going to tourist hotels and tourist restaurants? Older Women, Cheap Travel offer tours that cost one-third of what most companies charge and all of us women (10 per trip) share rooms which keeps the cost low. We also take local transportation (like \"Chicken Buses\" and Tuk-Tuks) and eat local food (in the market, on the street, in small restaurants). We see the sites but we also enjoy the culture by going where the locals go and not just to tourist venues. I, Pat Brown, will be your guide. Our upcoming trips are to Nicaragua from Jan 5-16, 2016, India in March of 2016 and Mexico in the fall of 2016. Find out more about the trips and how we travel at:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.olderwomencheaptravel.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.olderwomencheaptravel.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>When we meet, we will enjoy international food at a variety of restaurants and we will talk about our experiences as women travelers and share tips and stories and our wish list of places to go. You may find yourself a travel partner, you may find great ideas to travel solo or hear about wonderful opportunities to join groups at a cheap price (like this great hiking group I joined in Guatemala; $20-$30\/day for the hiking guide, lodging, and food and all the money earned went to charity!) Even if you never go on an Older Women, Cheap Travel trip, you are welcome to join our Meetup event and share travel ideas and experiences.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you are not 20 or 30, you can still have a travel adventure and not go broke doing it. By the way, I am turning 60 next month and I still love to travel in a more adventurous way than being carted around in a \"seniormobile\"!<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>This is the first Italian meetup group in Howard County! We focus heavily on learning Italian, appreciating Italian culture and we have members of all levels of proficiency from beginners to native speakers. Beginning speakers are very welcome but will need to self-study and also feel comfortable coming to groups where intermediate and native speakers will be talking quickly. In our small conversational groups members who attend will practice one on one with other beginner, intermediate and fluent speakers in a comfortable low-stress environment and the pairings will be switched regularly to keep the meetup moving along, provide the maximum amount of practice and opportunities to get to know more members. If you need more resources aside from Duo Lingo, don't hesitate to contact me. <br><\/p>\n<p>If you're interested in Italian culture BUT you don't want to learn Italian or don't have the time right now then this isn't the group for you. Passatempo &amp; Piazza Italia are two D.C. groups with thousands of members that have many fun events and you don't need to be a fluent speaker to attend them. There is also a Montgomery County group that will have a monthly event for beginning speakers starting in the fall. <br><\/p>\n<p>Anyone is welcome to suggest new types of meetups and organize them. Since this is my first meetup group feedback is much appreciated. The events that we do regularly are 3-4 conversational groups per month, the monthly world language cafe at Wegmans, and pizzeria and restaurant nights out which are very popular! There is always room for more types of events like happy hours, a book club, and concerts, plays and carpooling down to some of the events in D.C. and Montgomery County. Spero di vedervi presto! I hope to see you soon! <br><\/p>",

We are a fun loving, award winning group of women who meet in Harford County on Monday nights every week to hone our vocal skills, learn music and perform. We sing 4 part&nbsp;a cappella harmony in a variety of styles from barbershop to Beatles, ballads to beat boxing - okay not beat boxing--- yet. Don't worry if you don't read music, many of us don't, many of us do, so there's room for all skill levels. Bottom line, if you are looking to spend some time learning or re-learning what it is to be part of ensemble singing, this is the place for you... And we can't wait to meet you! Join us any Monday from 7-10 pm at St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Aberdeen, MD! <br><\/p>",

Now a humorous parody of that, a badass soup kitchen action scene, or drama at the soup kitchen, probably.<\/p>\n<p>It's really dependent on the talents that are hired and their interests. For instance, I am trained in martial arts and firearms so action shorts would feel natural for me though I would love to do more than that.<\/p>\n<p>Oh and sorry to disappoint, but no pornos(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL929189BAC4C645A2\">unless they're like James Gunn's PG porn videos on YouTube<\/a>) and no snuff films.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><b>WHO AM I LOOKING FOR?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Who am I looking for to join this production\/journey\/quest? Talents. That includes actors, directors, fight choreographers, cinematographers, writers, etc(I laugh at those who only call the actors \"talents\"). Because I'm deliberately keeping group membership small and tight-knit, there's a chance many of us will be involved in multiple roles. In-depth answers to my membership questions will sway me more toward wanting you onboard. <b>ONE WORD OR FEW WORDS ANSWERS WILL LEAD TO REJECTION<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>Oh and if you're easily offended... probably not the best group to join. Generally, \"PG-13\" content is what we'll usually end up doing, but well I don't like to limit the creativity of this group. If you can handle South Park or a Quentin Tarantino film then you should be good to go.<\/p>",

As I get older I realize how difficult it can be to establish and maintain friendships with like-minded women and I'm sure others have experienced the same. So if you are new to the area or just looking to make genuine connections and have fun while doing it this is the group for you! Although the group is based in Laurel it is open to anyone in the DC\/Baltimore metro area. We will try to have events outside of Laurel so that we can cater to everyone in the group. Also, if you want to organize your own meetup please, by all means, feel free! I look forward to having some fun! -Jamie<\/p>\n<p>FYI - If a group member 'no-shows' for two events then they will be removed from the group.&nbsp;<\/p>",

My husband and I have a young toddler and about to have our second child and are more and more feeling isolated in this state, because our views are so different than many of our friends and the community.&nbsp; It's not that we talk politics with others, but as they share their opinions on their own or we watch the news, we see just how different we are and feel a bit out of place.&nbsp; We often hear things and will ask each other, \"are we the only ones here who think that is totally insane??\" &nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<blockquote> \n <p><i>Our culture has accepted two huge lies. The first is that if you disagree with someone\u2019s lifestyle, you must fear or hate them. The second is that to love someone means you agree with everything they believe or do. Both are nonsense. You don\u2019t have to compromise convictions to be compassionate.<\/i>- Rick Warren. I totally agree with him. <br><\/p> \n<\/blockquote>\n<p>We would love to expand our group of friends to include some conservatives. I also miss the south so much and would love to make a few southern friends up here.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>For those interested who stay at home, we could plan a weekly or monthly bible study and let the kids play, plan play dates elsewhere, craft nights, my husband loves golf and real estate, we would be up for planning family cookouts, football games, holiday parties, ect.&nbsp; I'm open to anything with this group.&nbsp; Just curious to see who is out there! &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>",

Instructions are designed for both beginners and experienced practitioners.<\/p>\n<p>Most classes and workshops are free for all participants. Although a donation amount is suggested, donations are not required for participation. The MBSR courses are not free, but some scholarship is available. While the forms of meditation we practice are rooted in Buddhist teachings, the study and practice of mindfulness and insight meditation is applicable to anyone from any background or religion, and all are welcome.<\/p>\n<p>We are affiliated with the Insight Meditation Community of Washington (IMCW) and the teaching of Tara Brach, Jonathan Foust and Hugh Byrne.<\/p>\n<p><b>Each class will include:<\/b> guided meditation, instruction, opportunities to practice, and time for discussion, questions and answers.<\/p>\n<p><b>When and where:<\/b> Our ongoing drop-in class meets every Tuesday from 7:00-8:30 p.m. at Baltimore Yoga Village in the Mt. Washington area of Baltimore. Please arrive early to settle into your seats - we start right at 7:00 p.m. If you arrive late, please enter as quietly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Other classes, workshops and courses are provided on an occasional basis.

Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p>\n<p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p>\n<p>What we offer: Our ongoing drop-in Tuesday evening classes generally consist of one or two half hour semi-guided meditations, mindful movement, a talk on Buddhist principles and their application to daily life, followed by discussion and\/or practice.<\/p>\n<p>We offer workshops (typically day long) to help deepen practice. Some of our workshop topics are: Deepening Insight, a Daylong Silent Workshop; Insight Out Loud (working with partners to deepen insight); A Day of Heart Practices; Deepening Presence; and a Relationship Workshop.<\/p>\n<p>Our 8-Week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) courses help students initiate and develop an ongoing daily mindfulness meditation practice. These 8-week courses are designed to help students develop strategies to reduce stress and to relate to their day-to-day experiences in a more calm and creative manner.<\/p>\n<p>We also sponsor Kalyani-Mitta (KM) groups. These are groups that meet outside the normal class hours to discuss Buddhist principles more in depth and to share about how these ideas apply to their personal lives. These groups also help foster deeper connection to other members of the community (sangha).<\/p>\n<p><b>Teachers:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Stan Eisenstein, MSW<\/b>,&nbsp;is a former high school physics teacher who has been meditating for&nbsp;30 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.

Let's get together and offer support.  I am not a licensed therapist or a doctor (far from it!), but I am a wife who has done a tremendous amount of reading and would like to connect with others in similar partnerships.  If you are on FaceBook, check out \"Becky's\" page titled:  A Spouse's Story PTSD.  This woman has been an inspiration to me!  I hope to use many of her topics and discussions as starting points for this group.  Looking forward to meeting you!",

        "description": "<p>I don't know about a lot of you but I was having a hard time finding something on here that didn't seem like you had to be up for the same thing every week or plan in advance. I'm hoping this can just be something like a bulletin board. A 'I'm doing this later if anyone wants to come, maybe meet someone new or just get out of the house' kind of thing. Hopefully keep things stress free. For now I'm probably just going to be posting when and where I'm hanging out with my dogs (which isn't going to be a marathon walk by any means, I got one crazy mini poodle and a large puppy who doesn't listen real well) but I'm open to suggestions. I'm hoping there will eventually be postings for all kinds of 'I'm going to be at' things like museums, historical sites, concerts or festivals. And, if there's any interest, short term arranging to be online at the same time for various video games. The only 'rule' (and it's just a suggestion really) is that, if you say you'll come, show up. Just so that no ones looking around for familiar faces that don't exist. But feel absolutely free to just show up without saying you were going to.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, I've realized I may need to make something perfectly clear (though I hope many of you feel this way too), when I put LGBT friendly I meant to *every* letter of that and even the ones not listed and the ones I may not even know exist and heterosexuals too. I want this to be a friendly welcoming group, accepting, tolerant and not letting stereotypes and ignorance guide their opinions. As someone who self idenifies as bisexual I hope you'll give me that same curtousy too and judge me only by the content of my own character and not hurtful stereotypes.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>The Bulletin Board post under 'Discussions' is for any member who wants to to post something they're doing. If it's three or more days away and it's original to this group (as in: I don't need permission to post it here or coordinate with anyone outside this group or it's not for someone's personal business) I'll set it as a meetup on the main page. And, If I haven't done this for some reason, feel free to message me; I may need to be reminded or have ones I haven't noticed yet pointed out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>And, apologies if there are some growing pains while things are starting out.&nbsp;<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>I created this group because I was dissatisfied with existing groups in the general Baltimore County area pertaining to social anxiety, shyness, and introversion. I am less interested in having a support group or therapy sessions, and more interested in just having fun with some down-to-Earth, good-natured people who don't have the most active social lives, or are just plain bored. Anyone is welcome, but just keep in mind that I myself am not exactly a socialite, and am doing this as a way to get out of the house more. Don't expect large gatherings of dozens of people or rowdy nights out; I'm more into just relaxing, going to the movies, or finding a place to hang out where we can do something simple.<\/p>\n<p>I've also found that many meetup groups tend to have members of mixed ages, and while there's nothing wrong with that, I think it'd be nice to have a group in the Baltimore area (I'm in Dundalk, or the 21224 zip code for reference) for shy people exclusively in their 20's so that we don't have to feel even more out of place or awkward than we already might. Also, groups geared toward very specific, \"geeky\" activities are fine, but unless you're intimately familiar with whatever the hobby is, there's a good chance that you'll stand out or feel insecure if you have anxiety and aren't a super expert at anything in particular.<\/p>\n<p>I don't want anyone to have to feel that way. I just want friends -- regardless of what their knowledge of advanced literature or geek culture is like, and without anyone having to worry about not fitting in or being drowned out in a large crowd. Let's see if we can get a small group of friends going in a totally chill, non-judgmental environment where there's less emphasis on constant meetups and more emphasis on just connecting as people, on our time, whenever we feel comfortable doing so. I'm totally fine with Skyping or having casual phone conversations when we're unable to meet in person, as well.<\/p>\n<p>One other thing: Because I do have some anxiety issues that I'm trying to overcome, I'm not too into traveling long distances for meetups, or doing anything like going to clubs or concerts. I'm just looking for something interesting and relaxing to do in Dundalk or the surrounding areas of Baltimore County, even if it's just getting something to eat or seeing a movie or going to the mall and sitting around once in a while -- and, again, as I'm more interested in genuine friendships than in \"activity partners,\" I'm totally fine with just talking on the phone once in a while or doing some online gaming or something like that. I really have no idea what this group should be, so if you have any ideas, definitely let me know. I read too many posts on sites like reddit about how people waste their 20's being lonely, and I think that if you're in that boat, let's forget what a conventional meetup is \"supposed\" to be and just try to be awesome friends.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>The <i>Women's Christian Trauma Freedom Group<\/i> is a safe place for all women who are seeking wholeness in the wake of those challenges which burden and confine the spirit. <br> <br>Created for childhood and adult trauma survivors, our group is centered on true, whole person freedom; freedom to move beyond the pain and into that inheritance of authentic peace, wholeness, and purpose which all are afforded in Christ. &nbsp; <br> <br>As a discreet, preapproved members-only group facilitated by Certified Professional Coach Janet Thompson, MA, we benefit from the comfort of private weekly sessions* to open and heal with each other.&nbsp; Attendance is limited to ten members per session; and requires a firm personal commitment to one's goals and progress.&nbsp; With a clear focus on Christ as Healer, you are invited to join us on this journey as we seek to move beyond surviving and into abundant life.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br> <br>Our weekly gatherings are held in a quiet, safe setting located in Historic Ellicott City.&nbsp; The first Monday session in each month is reserved separately as an orientation for those discerning membership, and for those seeking to know more about our healing Group.&nbsp; To help cover expenses, a suggested personal contribution* of $25 per weekly session is collected anonymously at our regular meetings; and first Monday orientation sessions are always free. <br> <br>If desired, new members may also request a personal meeting with Janet in place of first Monday orientation.&nbsp; Please contact Janet for details and further information. <br> <\/p>\n<p> <br><b>Times:<\/b> Mondays at 7PM; holidays excluded. <br><b>Location:<\/b> Historic Ellicott City (specific location provided to approved members only). <br> <br> <br><i>*Question:<\/i>&nbsp; Janet, why don't you charge a set fee for attending this group? <br><i>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; Answer:<\/i>&nbsp; Very simply, I desire to reach as many women as possible with the message of hope, freedom, and healing which the Lord has given me to share.&nbsp; I have been blessed, and I want to bless others. <br> <br><i>*Question:<\/i>&nbsp; I'm not sure I want to open up in front of other people.&nbsp; Do you have something that would work for me? <br><i>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; Answer:<\/i>&nbsp; For those who seek a privately individualized healing path, I also offer directed, one-on-one personal coaching as client scheduling may permit. <br> <br><i>*Question:<\/i>&nbsp; I want to move forward quickly in my healing and feel like I could be held back by a group setting.&nbsp; What do you suggest, Janet? <br><i>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; Answer:<\/i>&nbsp; First, please keep in mind that the <i>Women's Christian Trauma Freedom Group<\/i> is firmly centered on the concept of \"healing at your own pace.\"&nbsp; Everyone will receive the same opportunities to move forward in freedom and abundant life; what you choose to act on (and when) is completely up to you.&nbsp; The possibility also exists for one-on-one, personalized coaching with me for any who may desire a more focused approach. <br> <br> <br>About Janet <br> <br>Janet Thompson MA, CPC is a Certified Professional Coach and childhood domestic violence and abuse survivor.&nbsp; For over 19 years, Janet has coached individuals and leaders of all kinds, from church pastors to childhood abuse survivors; from those in troubled marriages to \"ordinary\" women desiring to grow in community, strength, and faith. <br> <br>Janet's heart for reaching out to women first drew her to coaching.&nbsp; After obtaining her Master's degree in Christian Ministry with a certification in Marriage and Family, she developed and ran <i>Becoming<\/i> -- a monthly group coaching and retreat program for women.&nbsp; For almost two years, the women under her care came together regularly to find balance in their busy lives, explore their relationship with Our Lord, build a network of support for the journey, and become all they were meant to be in Christ.&nbsp; Energized by this experience, Janet has been coaching ever since. <br> <br>In addition to her work as a professional coach, Janet has given more than 280 presentations, classes, and workshops around the nation; including Phoenix, Seattle, Baltimore, and the Midwest.&nbsp; Her audiences have ranged from groups of under 20 to over 200, from teens to adults. &nbsp; <br> <br>Janet firmly adheres to the International Coaching Federation (ICF) Code of Ethics for all her group, marriage, and individual coaching clients. <br> <br> <\/p>\n<p> <br>Theme photo courtesy of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/alanasise\">Alana Sise<\/a> (adapted image per <a href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0\/\">CC BY 2.0<\/a>)<\/p>",

They have an unquenchable thirst to knock things off of their bucket list, build businesses that they are passionate about and to live life to the fullest. The group is hosted by Zephan Moses Blaxberg, host of the Year Of Purpose Podcast on iTunes and Stitcher Radio. Zephan left his full-time 9-5 in pursuit of the entrepreneurial life but after two years of working for himself he decided to travel the country in a spiritual journey for happiness and meaning. Now Zephan teaches others what he calls \"Life Re-Scripting.\" Life Re-Scripting is looking at your life as if it were the script to a movie and picking out the pieces that you like and parts that you dislike so that you can change the story of your life and starting living more purposefully. Will you join Zephan and other like-minded individuals who want to live life to the fullest and make a difference in the world?",

I looked at the all-night mega-retail-emporium and thought, \"What if the neighborhood bought the business, the inventory, the infrastructure, and ran it as a non-profit to benefit workers and the community? People would be paid more, have better career prospects, better benefits, better training, no more prejudice. It would exert an upward pull on wages all over town. And shoppers would still get the same great deals and feel less guilty about shopping there... Would you like to help make something like this happen? Of course you would. Corporate America has gone over the top. It's time to occupy the economy, not just pitch tents on Wall Street. Call me anytime Post Meridian 443 742 1104 if you have a question.

        "description": "<p><i>Breathing is the first act of life. Within the breath is the unexplored secret of life.<\/i> <br><\/p>\n<p>Join our group to <i>Experience Waves Of Happiness Like Never Before<\/i>. What takes away the happiness from us, is <b>Stress<\/b>. Stress is simply where demands of life are higher than our capacity to handle. Stress saps us of our life force, our energy. Tied to our past we are filled with Anger, Regret, Guilt, Blame. Imagining the future we are filled with Worry, Anxiety, Fear. We vacillate between our past and future unable to thrive in the present moment, The Now. Each moment spent dwelling on the past that is over or imagining a future that is unknown, is a moment stolen from our Life right here and now. The now is what holds the Joy, Enthusiasm, Peace, Calm, Clarity, Efficiency, Productivity. Neither at home, nor in school are we taught skills on how to live in the now. The secret to living in the now, is hidden in the breath. <br><\/p>\n<p>Come explore the breath, and experience the magic through yogic breathing taught by trained teachers from the <b>Art of Living Foundaiton<\/b>. The Art of Living Foundation was formed in 1982. It has a presence in 150 countries and has touched the life of over 370 million people. It is a front-runner in stress-management and humanitarian issues across the globe. The centerpiece of the Art of living Happiness program is a unique and profound Breathing Technique <b>Sudarshan Kriya<\/b>, a practical tool that restores body, mind and spirit into its natural rhythm of being. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Art of Living<\/b>: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.artofliving.org\/us-en\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.artofliving.org\/us-en<\/a> <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Free Intro Talk<\/b>: Tuesday July 14\u2019th @ 7pm. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Location:<\/b> EKAA, 68 Maryland Avenue, Annapolis, MD 21401 <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Online Registration for Course<\/b>: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.artofliving.org\/us-en\/program\/135627\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.artofliving.org\/us-en\/program\/135627<\/a> <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Weekly Reunion<\/b>: For group practice<br><\/p>",

Don't worry if you are struggling...we will work on ASL grammar, vocabulary, miming...and, most importantly, actually, making ourselves sign, sign, sign.<\/p>\n<p>I will run this group with a bit of structure.

Let me know if you would like an invitation to join my team on Slack.<\/p>\n<p><b> <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>What this Meetup Group is about?<\/p>\n<p>This Group is about helping people who are in the process of learning the latest techniques in PHP development (i.e. routing, autoloading, interfaces etc.) Also, it is about uniting around a common set of PHP libraries such as PHPMailer, Smarty templating, and the Stripe payment system. We can add to the&nbsp;list later what we choose together. We will work on what I call the no_framework codebase which can be used for building any web app that handles objects in CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) fashion.<\/p>\n<p>The organiser would encourage members to join him in focusing the source code towards functionality for school bus contractors. However, I'm sure the no_framework code can be applied to improving any other person or business' workflow.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br>Why &nbsp;join?<\/p>\n<p>Join this group to learn and build a PHP codebase which we can share amongst ourselves. It's better when people put their efforts in a more focused endeavor. There are many PHP novices who are turned off by the prospect of learning a PHP framework. The learning curve is huge and in the end you may not agree with the way the framework does things.<\/p>\n<p> <br>What members can expect? What are typical activities? <br><\/p>\n<p>Members can expect a meetup every month or two where someone would give a small talk about the no_framework PHP project. And in between meetups individual members can stay in touch and do GitHub pull requests to help improve the no_framework codebase. Also, many who are novices to PHP may find they need parts of their project implemented in JavaScript, CSS or other front end technologies. So, members who have proficiency in those can give talks and contribute code which is in those technologies.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Strong Bonds is a traditionally a military unit-based, chaplain-led program which assists commanders in building individual resiliency by strengthening the Army Family. The core mission of the Strong Bonds program is to increase individual Soldier and Family member readiness through relationship education and skills training. Strong Bonds provides a fun, safe, and secure environment. The Strong Bonds Community Singles Meetup hopes to bring this quality training to the civilian side of the house and strengthen relationships among the community singles which usually wouldn\u2019t have the chance to attend such training unless they were married to a military member.<\/p> \n<p>A high majority of American Citizens are single and most will get married under without a certain level of mentoring and counseling. If you\u2019re a single person military or not, you may also be far from home, lonely, and faced with the uncertainty or a strong long term relationship. These pressures can lead to hasty decision making when choosing a life partner.<br>A supportive mate is extremely important \u2014 so a current military member is committed to helping you learn how to make good relationship choices by offering the Strong Bonds Single program provided by professionally trained Strong Bond leadership.

I'm new to Columbia, so decided to make a group to meet some new people in the area and get some fun activities going. I'm hoping to make this a pretty activity diverse group and to keep meetups relatively small so that everyone has a chance to get to know each other. It'd be awesome to get a board game night going once a week or so in addition to whatever else gets done, but we will see! For those that don't know, Geocaching is hiking with a purpose. It's kinda like a treasure hunt using a GPS and detective skills.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Right now, there's only spots for 50, but if there's enough interest then I might up the count and take off the limitation. &nbsp;Please be sure to have a photo of yourself to join and answer some\/all of the questions! &nbsp;Looking forward to meeting everyone!<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>(And yes, the group photo for the moment is from the Kickstarter game Exploding Kittens! &nbsp;Just got my copy, and can't wait to try it out!

Our meetings include discussions, sharing own experiences - both - as facilitators\/therapists and clients, social outings, field trips, group meditations and hypnosis. <br><\/p>\n<p>Past Life Regression Therapy is based on the theory of reincarnation. It is belief that a soul survives death to be re-born again into a new body with renewed opportunity to learn life's lessons.<br><br>This powerful tool is used by even most skeptical, conservative and scientifically inclined therapists because it works regardless of our beliefs.<br>If there are no physiological or psychological reasons for your issue, then past-life exploration would be a wonderful way to uncover memory of a past trauma. Often Past Life Regression can reveal the root cause of a present symptom. Often just the matter of uncovering those memories is enough for the symptoms to disappear on it's own.<\/p>\n<p>Some people seek this kind of therapy with hopes to improve their health. Some people desire this experience out of pure curiosity. The outcome is the same - their life change in a very positive way. People are freeing them-self from pains, fears, physical conditions, gaining more understanding of who they are, improving their lives and their relationships. <br><br><br><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>I created this group to have a space where others who have gone through the process of Bariatric Surgery (Band, Sleeve, Bypass, etc), can come together to support, exercise and have fun together.<\/p>\n<p>Ideally, it will be a source of strength, social networking and friendship, as we individually explore the journey of our new, healthier lives!<\/p>\n<p>This group will meet for a variety of reasons:<\/p>\n<p>Support Group: Were we can gather to talk about our experiences, challenges, aspirations, dreams, nightmares, etc. It'd be great for those who are Pre-surgery to learn what to expect, as well as for those in any stage of Post-surgery to share their experiences and the inevitable emotional journey this process sets us on.<\/p>\n<p>Exercise: As you know, Bariatric surgery is simply a TOOL. This means, exercise is still very much on the list of requirements to succeed. It can be a challenge doing this alone if it's not been a habit. It's also a challenge to motivate yourself into improving in pace and intensity over time. As a group, exercising helps everyone. It's my vision that we will be patient with those who are slower in pace, simply because we have all been there before.<\/p>\n<p>Outings: Although the main purpose of this group is to support and exercise, I believe forming friendships and learning how to exist in the world, socially, with so many dietary restrictions, is a journey we can embark on together. There will be movies, dinner, festivals, etc. Anything that gets us out and about, and re-immersed into the world, albeit as renewed beings - hopefully.<\/p>\n<p>The objective of this group is to uplift, celebrate each other's triumphs and encourage each other into taking steps that are positive and inline with embracing this new found healthier lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>I hope you will join.<\/p>\n<p>PS <br>The restrictions to join are as follows:<\/p>\n<p>1) You MUST be Pre-Op Bariatric patient with a set date for surgery.<\/p>\n<p>2) You MUST be Post-Op Bariatric patient. Whether you had your surgery yesterday or 50 years ago, is of no importance. Everyone is welcome.<\/p>\n<p>3) You MUST be uplifting and be of the mindset that promotes healthier living\/being. (No Sabotagers are welcome in this group!)<\/p>\n<p>4) Paying Dues will not be required for now, but contributions towards it would be really nice to have. I'm starting this because I feel there is a great need for it.<\/p>\n<p>5) All meetup events will be focused in the Maryland (PG\/Montgomery areas); however, meetups outside these areas will occur from time to time with the consideration of having access to FREE PARKING.<\/p>\n<p>6) I am open to suggestions for meetups and will do my best to act on them immediately. All Emails will be replied. This meetup is for all of us!<\/p>",

We\u2019ve had some fun, and we\u2019ve learned how much fun is too much fun. We know what is important in our lives, and we know who is important in our lives. Now we want to meet new friends.

        "description": "<p>We will get together weekly in small intimate groups to listen to one or two songs of the following Indian subcontinental traditions: Qawwali, Baul, Kirtan, etc, and then discuss lyrics and the effect of the music on our selves. No bars on religious views or national origin, open to all aashiqui. This group is an attempt at recreating that spiritual diversity we find in the subcontinent before we get neatly boxed into categories in the diaspora. Note, the musical presentations discussed in this group will be extremely authentic, folk\/village level and rootsy. We are not into a Bollywood or Indipop rendition of a Bulleh Shah piece, but rather Nusrat presenting it in his element at urs of Ganjshakar as we find such renditions as having the authentic soulful nature to them that bring out the quality of the poetry. So if you want to recreate that dargah atmosphere, come and mingle with us. There are no fees, company is priceless. Feel free to bring food if you want just for yourselves or to share.<\/p>",

How many audiophiles out there like to build their own HiFi equipment? Who else out there bemoans the lack of a place to go when a part is needed on-the-fly? How many people would like a place where they can learn more advanced design techniques, make and drill their own circuit boards, customize their enclosures, and do advanced diagnostics and benchmarking? There may just be enough of you out there to make it worthwhile to build such a place.",

But then you hit a snag or you need someone to serve as a mirror. What do you do? Come to the Badass Support Group! I am not a life coach and I don\u2019t have a business that would benefit from this group. My intention is purely to provide a way for badasses to meet face-to-face and support each other. The agenda of the group is simple: help other badasses with whatever goal they are working toward. Meetings could involve helping someone identify their roadblocks or maybe brainstorming ideas of what they can do to reach their goals. Everyone must remain positive, nonjudgmental, and encouraging. I want to keep the meetings small and high quality. So, if you sign up but find that you cannot attend, please change your RSVP. Once we get going, I\u2019d like to identify a couple inspirational badasses who feel comfortable moderating a small group. That way, we can have several small groups meet at the same time!<\/p>",

I began this meetup as a forum for investors to trade ideas, recommendations, &amp; tricks of the trade. I encourage sellers and listing agents to market properties here that have potential to be a profitable flip. This meetup will be a great place for buyers to find off market properties and deals on properties that need to be sold quickly. It will also be a forum for investors to find good contractors and other services through the recommendations of their peers. If we have robust discussions online that lead to us flipping houses and making money then we will have a lot more to discuss at our next meetup. Let's make some deals &amp; let's make some money. - Wade",

So that\u2019s where they put the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.&nbsp; Most people who go through Kent Island think of it as a place to stop for gas or snacks before or after the Bay Bridge, but get off Highway 50 and you\u2019ll find an historic town, beaches, crab houses, tiki bars, farm fields, parks and some of the best biking trails in the area.&nbsp; We hope you will join our group for some great exercise and at the same time getting to know Kent Island more than you could by driving your car around the island.<\/p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing you on our Saturday bike rides!<\/p>\n<p>Richard <br><\/p>",

So most events will be kept at small numbers so we can do just that :-) The expectation is that our members are active. While we are a laid back and fun group, we do treat other Meetup members as we would any other of our friends: with respect.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Our group considers Meetups which we RSVP for priorities; the Organizer reserves the right to remove a member from the group if she does not show 2 times. RSVPs are to be updated respectfully (about 24 hours prior) to allow other members to attend an event, especially for activities with limited spots. It is expected that the moment you decide not to attend an event that you previously RSVP'd for, you will make every effort to notify the event host and\/or update your RSVP status.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I look forward to meeting you and sharing in some awesome life adventures!<\/p>",

We welcome <b>singles, couples and groups of friends <\/b>who wish to explore different exotic and in-demand locations throughout the year. <br><\/p>\n<p>Our group operates on the belief that travel is always better with friends and groups of people. We also believe that those who love to travel should link up and meet others that wish to do the same! We are looking to do 2-3 international trips a year and a couple local excursions around the D.C. and Baltimore areas. We will also host mixers and information sessions about our trips when one is planned. <br><\/p>\n<p>There is no cost to be a member of our travel club, but we do welcome member contributions or any amount. However, the club will be restrictive in membership admittance. Our member limit will initially be set at <b>50 members<\/b>, but will increase upon appropriate demand. Each member is approved by group organizers. Our trips will also be limited to the first <b>20-30 people<\/b> per trip, unless demand appropriately calls for expansion. <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><b>We have three (3) rules for our travel club.<\/b> <br><\/p>\n<p><i>\u2022&nbsp;You must be over the age of 21 <br><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>\u2022&nbsp;You must own a passport <br><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>\u2022&nbsp;You must not drop out of three (3) trips after initially RSVPing for exclusive spots available on said trips. <\/i> <br><\/p>\n<p>On the third \"drop-out\", you will be removed from the group.

It is a place where we can gather together as females to support each other and be \"real\", and talk about all the things we never talk about in our society because most of the time we are judged shamed or ridiculed for it.  We need a place to go to be together and be heard and seen and honored and celebrated and nurtured!  We go go go go go and we don't rest.. This gathering place is our time to rest and to feel supported through anything we may be going through.. It is a community of other girls and women of all ages.. Providing that deep celebration and nourishment we always give to our families.. It's our time to receive from the older women their wisdom and each other our presence to listen.  We can support girls first periods by having a party and every rite of passage of a woman's life pregnancy birth etc.. Through menopause ... In our patriarchal society we do not have a place to be to let our blood flow freely .... Here we can learn how to get in touch with our natural cycles and honor those monthly times in ceremony and rest,, eliminating pms and cramps and having space to just be for a day :) we are building love among females that have been disconnected from one another , from ourselves and from the earth for too long.. It is time to come together.. ",

You meet people all the time, but you may find it hard to make real connections because you can be shy. And people often mistake your shyness for being uptight, snooty, aloof, unapproachable, weird, or uninterested. But that's not you at all. You're compassionate. Considerate. Thoughtful. Caring. Adventurous. Creative. Quirky. Unique. You're an awesome friend, but you don't always get the chance to show that. Guess what? You're not alone. I've been judged for being \"different\"--left out of groups, wondering why no one seemed to understand me or like me. And I've always wanted friendships with Black women who could look beyond stereotypes and connect with the real me. You too may want those kinds of friendships. This group is the place for that. Let's have the relationships we want. Let's be the supportive, life-loving women we want to be. Let's share our stories with women who can relate and want to have fulfilling, honest friendships, too. And let's have a great time while doing that. We're unique--and that's a wonderful thing. We're Black Unicorns. Let's get to know each other.<\/p>",

The type of space we want will be dictated by the first members of the group. For my part I am looking for a shop space where I can setup my carpentry tools and the metalworking tools I use in the creation of products for my business, Jacob's Armoury. These tools will be available for use by other members of the collective. So if you are a writer, performer, painter, puppeteer or anywhere else in the creative continuum and looking for like-minded people to keep you motivated and space to make it happen give us a shout.<\/p>",

Please do not RSVP \"No\" in advance to every event listed on the entire calendar you already know you can't attend.)<\/p>\n<p>2) If you do not show up to an event without giving 24 hours notice, you will be counted as a \"No Show.\"<\/p>\n<p>3) People who \"No Show\" 3 times, will be put on restriction and will not be able to RSVP or attend events for 3 months. The Event Organizers definitely understand that situations can come up at the last minute that you can't always control, which is why we give you 3.<\/p>\n<p>4) \"No shows\" will eventually be removed from members account, based on your attendance at other events.<\/p>\n<p>5) To cover the cost the organizers pay Meetup.com to run the group, we ask for members to contribute $3.00 in yearly dues. Please pay your dues within 3 weeks of joining (and then by Oct 1 each year after), or you will be removed from group events (especially those where paid members are on the wait list) until you pay. The link to pay is on the left side of the page.<\/p>\n<p>Note: You might also be able to arrange to buy me a beer at one of our events in exchange for dues. Just arrange this in advanced so you aren't removed from an event and so I don't have 5 people offering me a beer at one event. ;)<\/p>\n<p>6) A clear picture of your face is required to join the group, so we can recognize you at events.<\/p>\n<p>These policies have been put into place to encourage respectfulness and active participation in the group.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for your attention to these policies! :)<\/p>",

If you have a stick bring it, if not we have extras. This is an already established group that meets on Sundays who are looking for more friends to play with. So come give it a try!

        "description": "This is a support group for people who suffer from social anxiety (Social Phobia or Social Anxiety Disorder). Unlike typical shyness, social anxiety is a persistent fear of certain social situations that causes a person to significantly modify his or her behavior in order to avoid social interactions. The phobia could be specific or general (fear of speaking in front of groups vs. fear of pretty much all social interactions). Most people experience some amount of anxiety in social situations, but those with social anxiety live with constant stress and fear. Due to the nature of the group, it will be limited to 50 participants. Group meetings will be kept small and only people with moderate to severe social anxiety will be permitted to join. There are many groups out there to help people with shyness or socializing. The purpose of this group is to create a safe space for all members to discuss their anxiety and methods to help relieve it, such as mindfulness and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.",

There's usually a free gym or field around Westminster to play somewhere. For starters, I'm leaving this open-ended and informal as we get a core group of players together. Then it would be great to have weekly or bi-weekly meetups for different sports depending on group interest. Be sure to join and let us know what you'd be interested in playing!",

If you would like to learn more about how to cook vegan &amp;amp; vegetarian food of a variety of styles &amp;amp; influences, and host small gatherings where you demonstrate a superb dish, we'd love to hear from you. Experienced and novice cooks are welcome. The goal of the group is to be vegan focused, or vegetarian with vegan options. The group can expand to a recipe exchange and larger pot lucks if there is interest. <br><br>The goal of this group is to share vegan cooking skills and knowledge. Cooking is a hands-on sport that is most effectively learned by observation and trial and error. There will be an educational component to each meetup, to learn about the dish, such as its cultural background and nutritional content, in addition to instruction on cooking technique. Since the meetups will be in members homes, we prefer if you only join the group if you are willing to host a small group in your own home and bring ingredients when joining meetups in other people's homes. Small apartments are fine, we will just limit the number of attendees to the people who would fit comfortably in the space. The meetups will be casual. I will likely host sitting on the floor Japanese style. If you are a novice cook and would like to host but aren't comfortable demonstrating, no problem, myself or someone else can do the demo. Looking forward to meeting you and sharing delicious vegan cuisine! <br><\/p>",

It's easy to let our ideas get lost in the shuffle trying to maintain a work-life balance. These pet projects are more than pipe-dreams: they are central to who we are as people. As a group, we can encourage each other to help these ideas thrive. The focus of this group is to nurture innovation through collaborative discussion and fun challenges. We're excited to meet coders, designers, testers, and anyone else wanting to be involved in the development life-cycle. Come share your knowledge, learn about new technologies, and connect with us.

        "description": "<p>Hey Greater Baltimore! My name is Kelly Lawrence and I am so passionate about my church, Messiah Community Church (MCC), I am looking for any and every way to share it with others. Growing up in \"the church\" (as it's often called), I thought I knew all there was to know about Christianity, yet once I became an adult, traditions, hymns, dresses, scriptures (without context), and ol' sayings didn't work for me. I had REAL problems so I need a REAL relationship with God. The problem was, I didn't realize I didn't have one. I thought going through the religious motions was the relationship. No one explained the why, what, and how to me&nbsp;<span>until I got to MCC.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>With bible-based, life application teachings by Former Baltimore Ravens Chaplin (1999-2013), Pastor Rod Hairston, every Sunday is a \"real talk\", mind-opening experience on how to improve yourself, your World and your life for the benefit of all mankind and to the glory of God. The worship is phenomenal, the teaching is relevant, and the service is an express 75 minutes flat (Can I get an Amen)!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>I'm so blessed to have found this gem so I want to be a blessing and share it with everyone. I'll tell you the story about how I ended up at MCC when we see each other (and ooohh it's God glorifyingly goooood) but in the interim, I want to invite you to join my Meetup group for updates on all things MCC to include;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>*Small Groups (If you're not thinking, talking, crying, praying and laughing at your current small group... you're doing it wrong. Join US!)&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>*Community Events (Free food, fun and love September 12th at our Church Dedication and Family Fun Day!)&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>*Worship Services (every Sunday at 9:30 and 11!
