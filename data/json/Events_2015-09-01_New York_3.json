Afterwards, we'll walk through Inwood Hill Park, the largest forested area still remaining in Manhattan, and the only entirely undeveloped park.

It is owned and maintained by the Town of Warwarsing, NY for recreational use by the community. Active recreation activities include soccer, basketball, handball, softball, hiking and of course, mountain biking. There are also picnic areas, pavilions and a pond. With Minnewaska State Park and Mohonk Preserve less than 10 miles away, the Lippman Park mountain bike trail system provides riders with a great alternative to carriage roads and one of the best singletrack mountain biking venues in the Hudson Valley.<\/p> <p>The Renegades Mountain Bike Club was instrumental in creating and building the Lippman Park mountain bike trails. From Doug Nikkila, a member of the Renegades MTB Club:<\/p> <p>\"Back in the summer of 2009 a group of us approached the Town of Wawarsing in Ulster County, NY with the concept of developing a network of singletrack trails in Lippman Park. Since last year, the Renegades has garnered a great bunch of very-involved individuals. This year alone we have put in over 1,300 hours to further the trail system. Our club maintains and builds all the trails through volunteer efforts in cooperation with the town of Wawarsing. The proceeds from our annual \"Blue Groove\" series of MTB races and events helps towards trail maintenance and development.\"<\/p> <p><i><b>THE TRAILS<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>Lippman Park features over 12.5 miles of fast and flowy singletrack trails with added technical challenges including bermed turns, skinnies, bridges and raised boardwalks. The trail system is a work in progress with additional miles and more fun features being added and planned, including a 60-ft suspension bridge that will span a ravine. The trails are well maintained, hard-packed singletrack with some rocky and rooty sections. With 1500 ft. of elevation gain over the entire trail system, you can expect some long climbs on individual trails. Those that like to get some air under the tires will enjoy \"The Viper\", a small freeride trail. It's a great place to go mountain biking with kids and have fun while developing and sharpening your mountain biking skills.<\/p> <p>Lippman Park offers an equal mix of beginner and intermediate trails with about 20 percent geared for advanced riders. For the most part, the trails weave through the woods, occassionally popping out into areas that offer a view. All the trails are marked with numbered 3 inch white discs and old bike frames indicate trail intersections. Bike helmets are required.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/e\/9\/9\/600_437184217.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i><b>Distance:<\/b><\/i> To be determined<\/p> <p><i><b>Estimated Bike Time:<\/b><\/i> 3 hours<\/p> <p><i><b>Difficulty:<\/b><\/i> Rated for Beginner to Advanced.

In this school, we focus in \u2018whole-body strength emission\u2019. In the area of self-defense, this is of major importance, since one wants to hit an attacker as hard and as fast as possible, and incapacitate him\/her within three seconds, in order to save our lives; while maintaining internal equanimity and control. However, most people respond to life-threatening attacks with only the strength of their arms or legs, as opposed to the strength of their whole bodies. Therefore, our responses to attacks are significantly hampered, and our chances of survival get drastically minimized.<\/p> <p>Erle Montaigue\u2019s Fajing Quan System of Fighting and Healing is the system of training created by Erle Montaigue, the founder of the World Taiji Boxing Association, in order to develop true whole-body fajing, the method of movement through which we engage every joint in our body in perfect coordination in an explosive manner, delivering full-body strikes into our opponent (think about how much you weigh, as opposed to only the weight of your arm or your leg).\u00a0<\/p> <p>This desired response is achieved by accessing our reptilian brain, which has been sophisticated through one\u2019s training, and operate from it in the event of an attack, as opposed to operate from our cerebral cortex\/human brain, which processes information slower by trying to understand logically what is happening. Our reptilian brain acts only on reflexes, which are deeply engrained in our nervous system; so our training will come out just as another learnt reflex, like muscle memory.<\/p> <p>This ability to fajing will be useful also in the healing arts, by emitting healing energy through the same method, in a soft, non-explosive way (Yin-Yang uses of a core, unique principle).<\/p> <p>The training consist on:<\/p> <p>- 8 Wudang Stepping Methods<\/p> <p>- 12 Wudang Hand Weapons Drills<\/p> <p>- Small San Sau Self-Defense Form<\/p> <p>- One Hand Yang Style Martial Push Hands<\/p> <p>- Entering Methods<\/p> <p>- Internal and External Mechanics for Striking\/Kicking\/Punching<\/p> <p>- Wudang Knife Forms<\/p> <p>- Introduction to Dim Mak<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Contact info: 646-820-8653","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/WTBANYC\/events\/223889597\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"WTBA's Fajing Quan - Erle Montaigue's System of Fighting and Healing","id":"dfxrhlytlblb","time":1439049600000,"updated":1439058405000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1401724195000,"name":"World Taiji Boxing Association - New York City","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":14829442,"urlname":"WTBANYC","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10475","country":"us","city":"Bronx","address_1":"2210 Bartow Avenue","name":"AMC Bay Plaza Cinema 13","lon":-73.823387,"id":10628752,"state":"NY","lat":40.868942,"repinned":false},"headcount":9,"distance":12.0015525818,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1436869363000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>12:10 PM Showtime!

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Ultimate Werewolf is a social game in which players are randomly assigned to one of two (or possibly more) teams: the villagers or the werewolves. The villagers must deduce who the werewolves are over a series of rounds using various techniques and social intrigue; this must be done before the werewolves are able to eliminate the villagers. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Ultimate Werewolf, check out Tom Vasel's review at:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kr1ZyYycUdQ\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kr1ZyYycUdQ\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kr1ZyYycUdQ<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Ultimate Werewolf is the perfect game to play in an outdoor setting; just bring a folding chair or a picnic blanket and you're ready to go! All you need is the game (which I will supply) and the willingness to communicate with others. We will also be bringing food and beverages in order to picnic throughout the day, so if that aspect of this event interests you, please bring something to pass (though participating in the picnic is not a requirement for this event). Also, if you do not know how to play Ultimate Werewolf, never fear, it is quite simple and several of us will be able to teach it to you within minutes; don't let that hold you back! We'll be meeting in Fort Tryon park, just north of Linden Terrace.

These challenges come in many forms and what is a challenge for one is not an issue for another. So everyone is unique and comes with their own set of experiences. But there are universal issues that we all face.\u00a0 The principal ones are money, love, weight, health, and career. We are raised to believe that the way to face these challenges is through hard work and a little knowledge. But nothing could be further from the truth. This is because success is not a set formula that anyone can follow. Everyone must take their own path to getting what they want and there is no one-size-fits-all template to success.<\/p> <p>Yet one thing is clear. Many go their entire lives working hard, waiting for their ships to come in yet with no or limited success. \u00a0Even worse, some seem to be magnets for money and success in life without putting in a hard day\u2019s work. \u00a0But why? Is the universe unfair? On the contrary, there is rhyme and reason to the madness. First off, you must understand that to overcome challenges in your life you have to get right to the source. Unfortunately, our society is caught up in verbal trickery. What I mean by that is that many come along with PHDs at the end of their names and try to address your issues through a verbal discourse in the hope that through deductive reasoning you will come to an understanding of what is the root cause of your plight. Millions of dollars are spent on this type of discredited Freudian treatment.<\/p> <p>But how many have been told to stop smoking, stop over-eating, stop taking drugs, stop dating that selfish person, yet they continue to do so knowing full well that what awaits them is likely to be pain and suffering. This is because verbal communication cannot change behavior no matter how passionate you are. How many preachers and ministers whose faith seems unbreakable are caught with their pants down in some type of indiscretion?<\/p> <p>Let us examine slavery for example. Many of the chief architects of this horrible atrocity were Christians, Muslims and Catholics. But if they were holy men and women how could they have endorsed the capture and enslavement of an entire continent of people? This is because their religions relied on sermons and verbal language through scriptures as a means to try and spiritually uplift people. This simply does not work. Our ancient ancestors knew this simple truth. This is why most indigenous cultures practiced meditation and trance induction as a means to communicate directly with the subconscious mind, which is the seat of your power.\u00a0 Now many are turning to hypnotherapy to control their weight, stop smoking or drug-taking, and to relieve pain from surgery or relationships. \u00a0These therapists and patients have finally realized that the power to effect change lies not in the conscious mind but rather the subconscious mind. We must realize that the conscious mind can only execute what the subconscious mind directs it to.\u00a0 The effectiveness of this type of treatment has been proven in many scientific papers and studies. Yet still to this day many are unaware of the success rate of techniques such as hypnotherapy and trance induction. This is because those in control, the global elite, have imprisoned our minds in left brain externalized thinking.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/6\/0\/600_439796928.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>HYPNOTHERAPY MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE<\/p> <p><br\/>Although it\u2019s on the cutting edge of mind therapy, hypnotherapists have made a critical error. They have treated the subconscious mind like a computer. Their psychology being what you put in is what you get out. This is untrue and demonstrates a true gap in their understanding of men and women. It was our ancient so-called primitive ancestors who referred to the subconscious mind as \u201cthe spirit\u201d or \u201cthe indwelling intelligence\u201d.\u00a0 They knew early on that the subconscious was consciousness and was intelligent. Hence it is omnipresent and omniscient.\u00a0 This indwelling intelligence doesn\u2019t just serve to direct the conscious mind based on commands you program into it, this intelligence is responsible for everything that happens to you in the physical world. It creates the very reality you see before you.<\/p> <p>This means it plays an active role in your life and is not just relegated to dreams, nightmares and subconscious thoughts and traumas. It is what some in the new age movement call your higher mind. It is all-knowing and connected to everything we experience. \u00a0If fact, there really is only one consciousness that we all share.\u00a0 But we erroneously believe there is a division within consciousness. There is only division within our physical bodies, which separate us on this planet.<\/p> <p>Treating the indwelling intelligence within you like a dumb computer that can only be programmed to accomplish the task it is given is to severely limit the power it can accomplish for you. Yes, it\u2019s true you must either program it or command it to perform a task but because it is a super-intelligence it is one thousand steps ahead of your perception. In fact, when you are born it is already aware of your destiny and aligns circumstance to allow you to fulfill the objective of your new incarnation. If you do not program it, it will proceed on its own and lay the foundations for either your success or failure.\u00a0 But in reality there is no failure, only experience, so what appears to you as a futile attempt is a great experience for the intelligence within. Remember, its goal is to experience reality based on the destiny you have agreed to prior to coming to this physical plane of existence.\u00a0 So as it sees it there are no good or bad experiences, only information to help it grow in understanding. But this is a discussion for another time; for now we want to focus on empowering you.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/f\/d\/a\/600_439797306.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>YOUR SUFFERING IS A NEEDLESS ACT<\/p> <p><br\/>We are taught that suffering is a natural part of life. In essence, no pain no gain. That we have to go through emotional ups and downs, pain and pleasure.\u00a0 In most cases when adversities befall those who have tried to live a righteous life we are told that God will right the wrong done in his own time. Yet, we are never told the entire truth; that pain and pleasure are emotional states that can be triggered at will.\u00a0 We simply, as a society, are ignorant of the fact that we, not some outside entity, have the ability to remove any physical or emotional pain troubling us. And also, that if needed we can summon such pleasure that it surpasses that of any drug.\u00a0 These are techniques that can be learned by anyone!<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s look at the implications here so we can see a real picture of how society has screwed up our thinking and belief system:<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A young man becomes addicted to drugs. His addiction causes him to lose his job, friends and the love of family members. He takes to stealing to support his habit. The urge for cocaine is so strong that he simply cannot resist it. In our society he is labeled a drug addict and ostracized. If he is lucky and not arrested for carrying the drugs he may go into a good and expensive treatment center, where they will talk him through a 12 step program.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A young woman suffers from poor grades in school. She tries just as hard as everyone else but can\u2019t seem to keep up. Many of the subjects she studies are very intense such as biomechanics requiring many hours of study and research. She fails her final term paper and is forced to repeat the class. If she decides to seek help they will assign her a study buddy who will spend countless hours with her in the library coaching her through the dense material.\u00a0 Her career is on the line and she must somehow pass this class while not neglecting her other classes.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A young man is motivated to start his own business. So he pays thousands of dollars to attend motivational seminars, business lectures and purchases all kinds of at-home programs on how to get rich. Yet, hard as he tries each business is a dismal failure.\u00a0 He becomes more and more disenchanted. He watches TV or the internet and sees the success others are having and comes to the conclusion that he is just a failure in life. \u00a0Once more he dreams of meeting big investors who will fund his business. But he knows he has no such contacts in his Rolodex. He gets a regular 9 to 5 and calls it a life.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A man is physically abusive to his wife and daughter. He seeks help to manage his temper and the psychologist traces it back to when he was a child. They discover that he was physically abused by his father and neglected by his mother. In fact, as a child he was sent to the hospital a number of times for broken bones and open wounds inflicted by the violence. The psychologist uses talk therapy to help him realize the origin and resolution to his difficulties. But the man still has occasions or bouts of anger so he takes it one day at a time.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A violin player finds herself spending countless hours and thousands of dollars on training. She enjoys the music and the instrument. Through the tried and true practice of repetition she practices the same songs and notes over and over again until she has blisters on her fingers. She even forks over her life savings to hire one of the best violin coaches in the country. She dreams of being in the London Symphony Orchestra or perhaps being solo as a world-renowned player. But she knows full well that it may take years for her to get to master the instrument. And worse, she may discover that she just doesn\u2019t have the talent for it and will have to make a decision to move on with her life. She fears being a housewife or working for corporate America. But the truth is the odds are not in her favor given the current paradigm of society and its failure on how to teach people to awaken their inborn talents.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 An aspiring actress looking for her big break attends casting call after casting call but doesn\u2019t land that big role. She pays for acting classes and attends seminars on how to make it in Hollywood. She even moves to California and gets a job as a waitress so that she can have flexible hours and attend her auditions.\u00a0 But the years pass and yet still no roles. Even worse with each audition she attends she is told she is not the right type. She is too old, too fat, too skinny, too short, too tall, too blonde, too ethnic looking, etc. All of this rejection takes a toll on her mindset. Where she was once a positive individual with hopes of movie fame she now realizes that success in acting eludes her. She gives up and gets a regular job, family and settles down to a normal life.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 An attractive woman is plagued by relationship issues. She dates different guys looking for her soul mate but there seems to be no chemistry with these men.\u00a0 Even worse, the guys are jerks, self centered and egotistical. She desires someone to compliment her and daydreams of the perfect mate and children. She realizes that her clock is ticking but there seems to be little that she can do. The club and bar scene is unrewarding as it only results in guys looking for one night stands. So too is the internet. She tries dating sites but the guys hype up their profile and are just looking for one thing. She has even prayed to God to help find her a good man but to no avail. She ends up becoming bitter and disenchanted. Finally, she adopts the belief that love is a myth.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A martial artist puts in hundred of hours of practice. She loves to spar and often travels the country competing in competitions. But she has reached a plateau and can\u2019t seem to advance to the next level.\u00a0 So she increases her efforts but can\u2019t seem to perfect her kicks or her form. She looks around at other martial artists who perform their fights with ease, never forgetting one step. She notes that they are bigger and stronger than her and wonders if she\u2019ll ever be at their skill level. She knows in her heart she has the fire of a lioness but something is holding her back.\u00a0 Her 5th degree instructor just yells at her telling her to push, push, push! But the more she pushes herself the fewer results she sees. So she resigns herself to the fact that she just doesn\u2019t have the natural ability that other martial artists possess.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A young woman finds herself in a terrible position. Everything she eats no matter how little increases her weight. She looks in the mirror and realizes she is severely overweight. However, she can\u2019t stop eating. So in an attempt to handle the situation she tries several fad diets. At first she loses some weight, which makes her feel good. However, in almost no time she regains the weight again and her self-image and self-confidence plummet. Even worse she realizes that when she goes out with her girlfriends guys no longer approach her. She tries diet pills but they don\u2019t work either. Finally, she takes out a gym membership but finds it hard to make the time to go to the gym after work. She knows that being overweight is a health risk but she feels there is nothing she can do. She wants to accept the notion that big is beautiful and accept her full-figured self. However, she often spends Friday and Saturday night at home in deep depression.<\/p> <p>As you can clearly see all of the case studies above have two things in common: the reliance on verbal communication to get a person to change his or her behavior, and the dependence on physical means to address their problems. If one were to examine the statistics we would see that such treatments are a dismal failure. But then one may ask why is it that some people have effectively quit smoking, shed weight or stopped drinking? Is this not proof that verbal talk does work?\u00a0 No, this is because the emotion and desire to change in those individuals penetrated the conscious mind and tapped directly into the subconscious mind effecting true change thus manifesting their desires.\u00a0 But not everyone has the knowledge to be able to do this nor are people aware enough to be able to reproduce the formula or effects. In religious circles this change is often mislabeled as being born again or God saved me. In secular circles it is attributed to a person\u2019s own drive to change all the while never realizing that the change came after they bypassed the conscious mind to communicate and commanded the subconscious mind to make the radical transformation.\u00a0 What folks failed to realize is that the power was always within them and the reliance on outside entities such as pills, gurus and books only served to make things more difficult.<\/p> <p>Now what I am advocating here is by no means a quick fix. But it is a lot easier than spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars trying to overcome a bad habit, emotional issue or learn something new. What we teach is so powerfully effective that you will notice the results overnight. We\u2019re talking about giving you not only the ability to overcome what is currently challenging you but to empower you with the ability to succeed in any aspect of your life.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/9\/6\/600_439796982.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>YOU\u2019LL HAVE THE POWER<\/p> <p><br\/>And do not forget that the net result of your efforts is not just the impregnation of information but the ability to tap into an awesome power that can align the forces of physical reality at your command. This is God\u2019s true blessing and the reason why you don\u2019t have to continually beg him for the things you need in life. He has given you the power to get them and more. Imagine if you will having the power to reshape the world to give you the things you need. This is why our approach is so different.<\/p> <p>In this extraordinary program you will be taken into trance induction where we will remove any block, emotional fears, addictions, and provide you with powerful suggestions to get better grades or excel in your chosen career or sport.\u00a0 Lastly you will learn how to perform miracles through synchronicity by attracting all the things you want in life.

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

I was looking forward to meeting them, and I am sure the other members were looking forward to meeting them, as well. I removed, banned them, and addressed the behavior. However, it still persisted. I have noticed that many Meetup groups have this problem. We are all busy people, and sometimes things do not go according to plan, but we must try to fulfill our obligations. At the time that I closed the group, I had others things that required my time, and I did not want to leave my members without anything to do while I was working. I have since completed them, and I want to continue this group. I enjoy researching, planning, and leading events.

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active\u00a0<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing\u00a0<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work\u00a0<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out\u00a0<br\/>5. Stop worrying\u00a0<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations\u00a0<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking\u00a0<br\/>8. Become present oriented\u00a0<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality\u00a0<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality\u00a0<br\/>11. Be yourself\u00a0<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems\u00a0<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness\u00a0<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>. \u00a0Everyone will read verses together from the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. \u00a0Atma and Subhie will together explain the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for almost fifty years, combined.\u00a0 We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p> <p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i> with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C.

But have you heard the one about the belly dancer? For the first time, The Jackie Mason Musical lifts the lid on the true story of Mason and his decade long love affair with the young Ginger Reiter, and the child they shared, Sheba Mason. Written, composed and directed by Ginger and starring Sheba as herself and her mom, this peek into the strange double life of an American icon is a hit for fans, old and new.<\/p> <p>It all began in Miami in 1977. When their eyes meet in a deli, Jackie and Ginger have no idea of the complicated and long-running love story ahead of them. Urged by her glamorous mother Mrs Oliver, Ginger falls completely in love and is happy to be wooed by Jackie whenever he finds his way to South Florida. Unbeknownst to Ginger, Jackie seems to have alot of young lady freinds all over the country and when she becomes pregnant, she's left to bring up young Sheba alone in the midst of heartbreak.<\/p> <p>Hilarious and original and packed with unique songs such as \"Just An Ordinary Man,\" \"I Never Met This Yenta\" and more, this critically acclaimed Off Broadway musical is an absolute gem!<\/p> <p>Ian Wehrle as Jackie Mason and a cast of 8.<\/p> <p>TheJackieMasonMusical.com<\/p> <p>ShebaMason.com<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Theater-Under-25\/events\/224159059\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Meet-and-Greet with entire cast of The Jackie Mason Musical following the show!","id":"224159059","time":1439078400000,"updated":1439090194000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1411784904000,"name":"New York Theater Under $25","group_lon":-74,"id":17237272,"urlname":"New-York-Theater-Under-25","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10018","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"209 West 40th Street","name":"Funkadelic Studios","lon":-73.988396,"id":15566682,"state":"NY","lat":40.755211,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.370270341635,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1404081904000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/5\/7\/a\/600_381162362.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>ALL AGES<br\/>$10 @ The Door = 4 hours of jamming &amp; practice time!\u00a0<\/p> <p>The Open Jams at Funkadelic Studios are great for musicians who are interested in networking with other like-minded artists, from beginners to professionals in all genres.

But have you heard the one about the belly dancer? For the first time, The Jackie Mason Musical lifts the lid on the true story of Mason and his decade long love affair with the young Ginger Reiter, and the child they shared, Sheba Mason. Written, composed and directed by Ginger and starring Sheba as herself and her mom, this peek into the strange double life of an American icon is a hit for fans, old and new.<\/p> <p>It all began in Miami in 1977. When their eyes meet in a deli, Jackie and Ginger have no idea of the complicated and long-running love story ahead of them. Urged by her glamorous mother Mrs Oliver, Ginger falls completely in love and is happy to be wooed by Jackie whenever he finds his way to South Florida. Unbeknownst to Ginger, Jackie seems to have alot of young lady freinds all over the country and when she becomes pregnant, she's left to bring up young Sheba alone in the midst of heartbreak.<\/p> <p>Hilarious and original and packed with unique songs such as \"Just An Ordinary Man,\" \"I Never Met This Yenta\" and more, this critically acclaimed Off Broadway musical is an absolute gem!<\/p> <p>Ian Wehrle as Jackie Mason and a cast of 8.<\/p> <p>TheJackieMasonMusical.com<\/p> <p>ShebaMason.com<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/jewishsingles304050s\/events\/224159205\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Meet-and-Greet with entire cast of The Jackie Mason Musical following the show!","id":"224159205","time":1439078400000,"updated":1439090194000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1359921365000,"name":"Jewish Singles - 30s, 40s & 50s","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":7009672,"urlname":"jewishsingles304050s","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Jewish Singles 40s & 50s"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07601","country":"us","city":"Hackensack","address_1":"187 Riverside Square","address_2":"The Shops @ Riverside","lon":-74.031627,"phone":"201-488-8037","name":"Barnes & Noble","id":984459,"state":"NJ","lat":40.90849,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.1874141693,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437501276000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Tom Doyle will speak and answer questions at the monthly General Meeting of the Science Fiction Association of Bergen County.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p>We'll play 3 simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with goals. There will be 6 teams on the field and we will play three games, 30 minutes\/game. Every 30 minutes we will have a short break and teams will switch to play against different team. Please check your email or our meetup message board on friday night or before 12.00pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p>If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.<\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>Riverside Park\u00a0at West\u00a0107 &amp; 108 Street<\/p> <p>Take the 1 RED Line Train to Cathedral Pkwy an walk two blocks down,\u00a0to 108th Street and Riverside Dr.<\/p> <p>The field is down the lower level near the river.

This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

After a cheese course\/tour and a tasting of their amazing grilled cheese sandwich, we head to Union Square and its world-famous greenmarket, which has been bringing the best of local farms to the city since 1976. Finally we head for dessert and a private tour at Bread\u2019s Bakery, an Israeli baking company opening up multiple locations this year throughout NYC.

It is a form that covers every possible defense and counter attack we might find in a real confrontation, and trains our subconscious to react properly in such situations. It also strengthens our muscles, sinews and joints in order to be healthy to defend our life. The series of intricate and specific movements also trains the practitioner in the usage of the correct muscles to strike and to perform fajing (explosive energy). Needless to say, like any other training method in the system, it also improves our self-healing and our ability to heal others, by combining forcefully our mind\u2019s intent with our qi, and teach them how to work together. This is a form that was developed by Yang Shouzhong, Yang Cheng-fu\u2019s eldest son, in order to bring back the Yang energy element stripped in the simplifications made by his father to the original form.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nNote:<\/p> <p>These series of free classes are intended to show the both sides of the original Yang style: the \u2018softer\u2019 and internal, and the \u2018harder\/martial\u2019 and external. It will also elucidate the link between the both sides of the same coin - fajing. On one side, we train it slowly, in order to train the subconscious on how to recover that natural expression of energy, and to impart it with some sophistication that makes it more suitable for our higher-goals: self-healing and medical (healing others) work. On the other, we train on how to use it for self-defense purposes, and on how it can help give us the best chance of survival when our life is in true danger.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Contact info: 646-820-8653","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/WTBANYC\/events\/224226140\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":3600000,"name":"FREE LESSONS Small San Sau Self-Defense Form","id":"fljnjlytlbmb","time":1439136000000,"updated":1439141281000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1401724195000,"name":"World Taiji Boxing Association - New York City","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":14829442,"urlname":"WTBANYC","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"73 Eighth Avenue (Between 13th and 14th Streets)","name":"Think Coffee","lon":-73.982567,"id":15199002,"state":"NY","lat":40.731339,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":6,"headcount":0,"distance":1.34967446327,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":2,"created":1438634648000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"par personne","currency":"USD","label":"Tarifs","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>LEVEL: INTERMEDIATE<\/p> <p>collective conversation: $10\/person -- Sunday 12-1pm -- (RSVP required)\u00a0<\/p> <p>A bient\u00f4t!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Rafa\u00ebl Leloup.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2014\u00a0seats are limited, please do not sign up if you can't come\u00a0\u2014<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/FrenchConversationGroup\/events\/224383496\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":3600000,"name":"French Conversation (INTERMEDIATE) - $10\/p","id":"224383496","time":1439136000000,"updated":1439141294000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1374351381000,"name":"French Conversation Group","group_lon":-74,"id":9441202,"urlname":"FrenchConversationGroup","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Francophiles"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"323 6th Ave","name":"IFC Center","lon":-73.980751,"id":24007827,"state":"NY","lat":40.671783,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.43716621399,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438737777000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Now that the political season is starting, It's time to get out of our bubbles.

We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/224378258\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Morningside Park","id":"gjrzflytlbmb","time":1439136000000,"updated":1439148539000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10024","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"West 86th Street and Central Park West","name":"Central Park West Quidditch Pitch","lon":-73.969337,"id":13848512,"state":"NY","lat":40.785313,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.67410039902,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1436400795000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>In the NYC area this summer and looking for an opportunity to play some quidditch?

Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Manhattan. Sunday, August 9th @ 1 PM<\/p> <p>Gotham Yacht Club is looking for fun sailors and non-sailors to join us this weekend!<\/p> <p>We take trips around the Manhattan area in a 50-foot Beneteau. We usually sail the Hudson--the Statue of Liberty to the George Washington Bridge--but also go to Martha's Vineyard, the Hamptons and the Jersey Shore.<\/p> <p>We like to fill the boat up with about 20-30 people. No sailing experience is required, but preference is given to experienced sailors since the trips can\u2019t happen without them.\u00a0 As space is limited on the boat, simply RSVP\u2019ing \u201cYes\u201d to an event does not guarantee a spot on the boat.\u00a0 If a spot is available, you will be contacted directly with event details.<\/p> <p>Sailors can take their first trip to get acquainted and enjoy the party.\u00a0 From then on, sailors can choose to (1) work the morning shift and help out with the launch or (2) work the evening shift and help out with the return.\u00a0 Generally, sailors spend less than a third of the trip working and can take the rest of the time to relax and socialize.<\/p> <p>The current crew is made up of young, educated Manhattan professionals. We are looking to meet new people who will enjoy the atmosphere and company of everyone on the boat.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you and\/or your friends are interested, please copy, paste, and fill out the questionnaire below in an email and send to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>.

Through four decades the fort's defenses were upgraded with the technologically advanced weaponry of succeeding generations, including smooth-bore cannons, sixteen inch naval rifles, and Nike Ajax and Hercules air defense missiles.<\/p> <p>Eventually its weaponry became obsolete, and the fort was decommissioned as a military installation in 1974.

When this happens a form of multi-dimensional healing occurs that becomes literally, spiritually, emotionally, physically, and even karmically transformational. Vortex Healing\u00ae works directly from the realm of divine consciousness. When you receive a healing you receive from a multitude of energetic and divine frequencies simultaneously. There are many levels to our consciousness, some containing the deepest and hardest to reach levels of negative conditioning, karma, and trauma. Vortex Healing\u00ae reaches all these levels. Vortex Healing\u00ae creates powerful and accelerated healing for the deepest of blocks, negative patterns and emotional trauma. It heals and transforms the very fabric of your reality. All negativity, disharmony, struggle, and even negative karma fall away to bring about incredible breakthroughs, freedom from the deepest of trauma, and a great opening to the flow of fulfillment and abundance. The divine frequencies used can reprogram core belief systems and negative emotional patterns that will bring more harmony and fulfillment both in your inner and outer reality. It also releases the illusion of separation consciousness, so each healing session brings you even deeper into your most highest divine expression. My Certification level is Merlin\u2019s Grace, one the most powerful levels of the Vortex Healing\u00ae. I have been practicing in the West Village for 14 years.<\/p> <p>On my level of certification I can heal up to 30 people at once. During the group healing I will introduce the many different healing frequencies to your system starting with: deep relaxation, energizing, healing structures, then the very profound core healing. Core healing will include a very intense karmic healing that afterwards will bring very powerful and magical transformational resolve of issues in ones inner and outer reality.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simondeacon.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.simondeacon.com\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Admission - $35<\/p> <p>\u2018\u00ae \u201cVortexHealing\" is a registered service mark of Ric Weinman.

We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

The series showcases artists in residence along with musical performances and DJs, curated by Olivier Conan.<\/p> <p><b>LIVE MUSIC:<\/b><\/p> <p>THE WESTERLIES<br\/>6:30pm<br\/>The Westerlies re-imagine the chamber music experience through boldly personal performance, recording, collaboration, education, and outreach. Since their inception in 2011, they have cultivated a new brass quartet repertoire featuring over 50 original compositions as well as adaptations of Ives, Ellington, Bartok, Ligeti, Stephen Foster and numerous traditionals. Their music exudes the warmth of their longstanding friendships, and reflects the broad interests of its members.<\/p> <p>JANKA NABAY<br\/>8pm<br\/>The king of Bubu \u2013 Sierra Leone\u2019s brand of electro-pop. Back in his hometown of Sierra Leone, Janka electrified traditional Bubu music by adding drum machines and synthesizers and giving it a frantic edge that made him a national hero. Now based in the US, Janka has hooked up with musicians from Brooklyn and DC (where he lives) who call themselves the Bubu Gang. Janka and his musicians share a similar fascination with the old and the new, mixing modern beats and analog keyboards with call and response vocals, improvisation and touches of 70\u2019s psychedelia. The collaboration seems to capitalize on the best of all worlds and the result is musically stimulating and just as danceable as Janka Nabay\u2019s early hits. David Byrne\u2019s label Luaka bop released their first full-length album a little while back.<\/p> <p><b>FOOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>LA NEWYORKINA<br\/>Selling paletas, Mexican ice pops, in the garden throughout the evening. All products are handmade from scratch in small batches, using the locally sourced ingredients. La Newyorkina donates a portion of their sales to Crea, an organization that helps generate employment opportunities in Mexico for low-income women.<\/p> <p>LOCAL ORGANIC MARKET<br\/>A Red Hook Community Farm pop-up market with fresh seasonal vegetables and herbs.<\/p> <p><b>EXHIBITS:<\/b><\/p> <p>Z, by Robyn Renee Hasty, a new series of glass plate portraits created during her year long residency at Pioneer Works. Working with transgender, cisgender and a spectrum of genderqueer and gender non-confirming individuals, Z is collection of images that challenges our expectations of how gender is expressed, embodied and perceived.<\/p> <p>NOMAD NO-MAD, by Hyon Gyon, brings together a grouping of the Korean artist\u2019s large-scale canvases. Appropriating finely-shredded cloth, fabric scraps, wax, and other objects \u2013 such as shards of glass and fur forming snarled teeth\u2013 many of Gyon\u2019s paintings depict a fearsome Korean shaman, while others more abstractly evoke a kind of existential, debris-ridden dread. One work features a vortex of childhood playthings; flattened stuffed animals revolve around a pseudo-face of sticky gold leaf, while a cheap, plastic doll is attached to the painting \u2013 rather brusquely \u2013 by its head, limbs hanging limply in the air. Both frightening and funny, Gyon\u2019s work looms existentially in No-Mad Nomad, vacillating between representation and abstraction, the mystical and the everyday.<\/p> <p>FROM WALDEN TO SPACE CHAPTER II\/ THE HUT, 2015, by St\u00e9phane Thidet, stages the collision between the book Walden or life in the Woods by Henry David Thoreau (1854) and the mission Mercury Seven (1958) sending men to space. It is a polymorphic work, with several chapters, evoking the questions of autonomy, isolation, solitude, but also contemplation and enlarged perspectives through music and live performance with modular synthesizers ( Ciat-Lombarde, Grendel Drone Commander\u2026).<\/p> <p>THE FOREST, by Andy Cahill, 2nd Floor Gallery,[masked] each panel 30\u00d740 inches, acrylic on canvas<\/p> <p>TRAINING SESSION, by Mathilde Roussel, 3rd Floor Gallery, discarded paper from everyone working at Pioneer Works to create paper pulp. After being grinded, the various stratums of paper will have slightly different grey tints and build historical layers that overlap, similarly to skins or rocks. This both practical and sym- bolic process will intrinsically link my sculptures to the community of Pioneer Works.<\/p> <p>OPEN STUDIOS: Carmen Bouyer, Clocktower Radio, Robyn Hasty, Nanotronics Imaging, Paul Korzan, Janna Levin, Long Distance Poison, Ido Michaeli, Azikiwe Mohammed, Jesse Moretti, Mathilde Roussel, Chris Woebken, and Antonia Wright<\/p> <p><b>INTERVENTIONS:<\/b><\/p> <p>LONG DISTANCE POISON<br\/>It Sounds Like Time Inside is a short film presented by Clocktower artists-in-residence Long Distance Poison, depicting experiments in candle making, modular video synthesis, and meditations on narrative and time. The evening begins with a short experimental candle and incense workshop. This workshop demonstrates the process behind the materials used in the film.\u00a0 Something seems to be revealed but then suddenly is concealed. A relation to Being flickers.\u00a0 During the opening of the video installation, Long Distance Poison hosts an experimental candle and incense workshop, forging material for their culminating A\/V performance, Sound and Time. Come observe their process and ask questions, dip your own candle, and experiment with your time.\u00a0 And a repeat performance of Long Distance Poison\u2019s modular video\/analog sound event Rumkala Malantara will take place in the Pioneer Works recording studio at 9pm.<\/p> <p>BORDER CROSSERS<br\/>Chico MacMurtrie\/Amorphic Robot Works premier the first version of Border Crosser, a lightweight inflatable robotic sculpture, which poetically explores and questions the notion of borders and boundary conditions. Inflating from a dormant organic heap of fabric into a form resembling a communication tower. It begins to arch toward the other side of the border as a peaceful metaphor.\u00a0 Its actions allude to the equality of humanity against a backdrop of tensions and conflicts over national and cultural identity. Technology comes to the fore in this questioning of the boundaries placed upon trans-border cultures and ecologies.\u00a0 Border Crosser provokes investigation of borders as constructed entities, expressing a utopian desire to live in a world without borders.<\/p> <p>Second Sundays starts at 4pm<\/p> <p>Meetup begins at 6pm<\/p> <p>$10 Suggested Donation<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/pioneerworks.org\/events\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/pioneerworks.org\/events\/<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nyc-variety\/events\/224191651\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Second Sundays @ Pioneer Works","id":"224191651","time":1439157600000,"updated":1439218343000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1432751474000,"name":"VSL: Offbeat & Eclectic Events for Irreverent Eccentrics","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":18629748,"urlname":"nyc-variety","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Irreverent Eccentrics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10010","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"2430 FDR Drive, East Service Road","name":"The Cabana Yacht","lon":-73.974153,"id":23748370,"state":"NY","lat":40.735382,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.30975949764,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438182390000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>For 1 night only, we're combining 2 of our most popular events (Quiet Clubbing &amp; Yacht Cruises) for the ultimate Meetup!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>This will be the best of both worlds.

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested.

(See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

Join the celebration of East Village's diverse food culture at Butter Lane Cupcakes and Tea Drunk's first-ever collaboration. \u00a0<\/p> <p>We tasted over 40 different combinations of teas and cupcakes, at risk of severe sugar high, to curate the perfect pairing of 5 terroir-sourced teas with petite artisanal cupcakes. The teas will be prepared in the authentic Gaiwan style. This is a one-day only event, do not miss!<\/p> <p><br\/>Paid reservation required.<\/p> <p><br\/>Butter Lane Bakery<br\/>\u00a0At Butter Lane, our mission is to make you the perfect cupcake. With a focus on high-quality ingredients such as vanilla beans, pure cocoa, dark chocolate, and never any additives or artificial flavors, we're giving real food lovers something to sink their teeth into. We offer 16 different American buttercream icing flavors, plus a French buttercream in either chocolate or vanilla. We've won a cult following from Manhattan to Park Slope. Professionals have taken notice too: Ted Allen nominated the cupcakes o<\/p> <p>n the Food Network Show as The Best Thing I Ever Ate!\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nTea Drunk Tea<br\/>is in so many ways like wine. Terroir matters a lot. Every tea season, founder Shunan Teng treks for three months through the backcountry of China to source our collection from 20+ historically famous tea mountains. Hailed by tea geeks around the world, Tea Drunk is a destination for those seeking exceptional tea and tea knowledge. Tranquil and romantic, Tea Drunk serves in the brewing style that is true to the region where the tea comes from.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/teacupcake.eventbrite.com\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/teacupcake.eventbrite.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/teacupcake.eventbrite.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/5\/3\/9\/600_440665913.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/f\/600_440643631.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Tea-Social\/events\/224473966\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Cup and Cake - A Tasting","id":"224473966","time":1439159400000,"updated":1439171722000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1366124258000,"name":"Tea-Inspired NYC","group_lon":-74,"id":8091022,"urlname":"NYC-Tea-Social","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Tea enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Nanuet","address_1":"119 Main St. 2nd Floor","name":"Writing Space - CILK119 - 2nd Floor - Nanuet","lon":-74.012962,"id":23946814,"state":"NY","lat":41.092907,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.7712497711,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437392975000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Directions: <\/b><\/p> <p>CILK119 is located in the garret of the Rockland County times building, at the corner of First and Main in Nanuet, NY.

I want to further guarantee that you will finish it. It\u2019s the fastest 1,000 pages you will ever know.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s necessary to say, up front, that whatever you might know or think about Norman Mailer, or whatever you might assume about the man, his work, his personality or his sociopolitical views, none of that information (or misinformation) applies here. This is a story that bears no markings of what we presume to be Mailer\u2019s prose style or point of view. The Executioner\u2019s Song is completely something other. Mailer once said that the book was given to him, whole and complete from God, and it\u2019s difficult to argue with that. the Executioner\u2019s Song cannot be improved. Mailer did not write a better book and I'm not sure anyone of his generation wrote a better book.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nI urge you to read this book without knowing anything more about the story it tells, By now, in 2012, the vast majority of readers new to The Executioner\u2019s Song will have little to no knowledge about Gary Mark Gilmore, the book's central figure, where he came from, what he did. that is to be expected and perhaps even embraced for our purposes here. Reading his story with our knowing the outcome will only enhance the experience - it gives the book unimaginable tension and scope-- and so I urge you to read nothing more of this introduction, which will discuss some to the issues the book raises and will reveal too much.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Eggers - Introduction from the 2012 printing<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs always, we'd love to have you join us, even if you haven't read the whole thing, if you've never come before, or you haven't been here in months.

We like to think of it as a kind of spiritual singalong, and who doesn't like a singalong? We use several easy-to-learn and different Sanskrit texts and leave it to members to choose a chant they'd like the group to use on a particular evening. If you have never chanted before, come along and try out this wonderful spiritual tool. It doesn't matter if it seems strange to you--the point is precisely to buck oneself out of a sense of 'ordinary' life--or if you think you are completely atonal. You will probably derive a lot of benefit from doing chant, and it can lastingly help you forward in life.<\/p> <p>After the chanting ends, we immediately go into silent meditation for 20-25 minutes. Whereas chant tends to focus and energize the body and mind, silent meditation tends to quiet and calm the mind. It's a perfect counterpoint to the chanting.<\/p> <p>As you can see, then, the Sunday evening meetings are a kind of dual spiritual exercise: of energizing and focusing the mind (chant) and then relaxing and calming it (meditation).<\/p> <p>Come along to this or our other meetings if you feel you'd like to live a happier, calmer life and be able to live fearlessly through the cares and worries of modern life.

Bring a guest your first visit and your first class is 1\/2 off.<br\/>This revolutionary cardio-based total-body conditioning program is based on the principles of MAX interval training. INSANITY pushes the participants to new training heights, resulting in more calories burned, faster results and more efficient metabolism. This interval training is the pinnacle of cardio training. You don't have to be in extreme shape - levels of each exercise are provided.<br\/>Insanity's not your traditional interval workout. It replaces traditional moderate-intensity exercise with maximum-intensity exercise, and trades short intervals of intensity for short periods of rest. The secret? Long periods of explosive intensity. You\u2019ll do cardio and plyometric drills with intervals of strength, power, resistance, and core training. With Insanity, you can burn up to 1,000 calories in an hour. Participants experience faster increases in cardiovascular fitness and burn carbohydrates and fat more efficiently.<\/p> <p>Class Description:<br\/>PLYOMETRICS for insane legs and gluts, UPPER BODY RESISTANCE for sculpted arms, shoulders, chest, and back.
