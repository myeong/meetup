Each walk is about 15-45 minutes, depending on how long you (or the dog!) want to stay out. You can walk as many dogs as you like. You can print the dog walking volunteer form in advance to save some time at the shelter, but it's not required: <a href=\"http:\/\/nyanimalrescue.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/SCAR-Dog-Walker-Package-MAIN1.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/nyanimalrescue.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/SCAR-Dog-Walker-Package-MAIN1.pdf<\/a>.<\/p> <p>If you're bringing a friend along, just know that you will only be able to walk one dog at a time if you walk together.

I help facilitate strictly educational classes which provide exposure to education we otherwise wouldn\u2019t have an option for or, at least, easy access to. Topics include:<\/p> <p>1. Altered Food and How the foundation of our food have been modified and the consequences<\/p> <p>2. Vitamins &amp; Minerals What\u2019s natural about being synthetic? As it applies to supplementation The Science of Glycobiology. What is glycosylation and how does it affect the proper function of your immune system? In today's modern world, one out of twenty five people suffer from autoimmune disorder. Stress, pollutions in the environment, and the lack of nutrition found in our foods are not all but a few causes which contribute to an immune disorder. Glycobiology is the study of the structure, function and biology of carbohydrates, also called glycans, which are widely distributed in nature. It is a small but rapidly growing field in biology, GLYCOBIOLOGY AS IMMUNE While sugar-nutrients do not treat specific diseases, they do allow for the cells to send proper messages within the body. When our cells communicate clearly, it is amazing what the immune system is capable of doing. Our bodies know how to make corrections and restore proper function, given the raw materials they need. These critical sugars are like the vowels in our alphabet. When the vowels are in place we understand our conversation. Glycans are complex carbohydrate structures that cover the surfaces of all mammalian cells, as they are added to proteins- and lipid backbones by the so-called glycosylation machinery enzymes, present in every cell. Glycans are the outer part of glycoproteins and form recognition elements for glycan sensor molecules that, upon recognition, mediate cellular communication. Glycan recognition plays a crucial role in cellular communication between immune cells. Dendritic cells that stimulat or inhibiting immune responses express many glycan sensor molecules. These glycan sensor molecules (called lectins) recognize specific glycans and can thereby instruct tailor made immune responses. Recognition of glycans on pathogens by dendritic cells can initiate immunological defense. There are approximately two hundred simple sugars found in nature but only the eight listed below are found in various combinations surrounding every single cell in the body, and are dominant ingredients in mothers\u2019 breast milk.<\/p> <p>Many of these sugars are stripped out of our modern, highly processed foods. They are also gravely missing from whole foods due to green harvesting and soil depletion. Our experience has been that the addition of these types of sugar-nutrients can have extremely positive effects on immune function and overall well-being. We are a society that is lead to believe that our bodies aren't capable of maintaining health and wellness on it's own, but when the immune system is able to communicate properly the body listens which makes the wellness journey not only exciting but transformational.

The thing upon which everyone can agree, though, is that MoMA and it's many exhibits are great for starting conversation. Whether you're a modern art enthusiast, an open-minded observer, or can't stand the stuff- there's always something that will spark at least a comment, and then a discussion to follow up. Whether the discussion is to agree, argue, or simply to clarify, it usually ends up being pretty engaging. And so there you have my reason for wanting to bring all of you there. If you're looking for the opportunity to expound on the genius of some abstraction of the state of modern man, or possibly just the chance to crack some jokes on some of the wierder pieces, we provide the company for you to do it in.<\/p> <p>So if you're interested in meeting a bunch of good people, checking out one of the best museums in the City, and also seeing some art you may or may not find to be odd, you're more than welcome to join us for the evening.<\/p> <p>Some extra details:<\/p> <p>Did you know that every Friday night, it's free to get into MoMA? If you didn't, now you do! And that's the reason we're headed there on a Friday evening- easy on the eyes AND the wallet. How can you beat that?<\/p> <p>Before anyone asks, I will be getting something to eat in the area afterwards. If other people would like to join me, that'd be great- in fact the part of a meetup I generally enjoy most is sharing a meal with people afterwards. Keep in mind, though, that there may be more people than will fit in whatever place I choose. If so, I encourage you to break off into groups with the people whose company you most enjoyed, and enjoy whatever restaurant you choose for yourself.

Situated atop of the Ink48 Hotel, the Press Lounge is the sister venue to PRINT. Restaurant, owned and operated by Adam Block. Opened in 2010, it quickly became recognized as one of Manhattan\u2019s finest rooftop lounges; Frank Bruni, of the New York Times, wrote that the Press Lounge was \u201cwithout question, one of the city\u2019s most attractive rooftop bars\u201d.

Egypt is also the land of secrets. Another history, a secret history, tells of Egypt as the inheritor of deep wisdom and magical ability from an even earlier culture. It is the account of the Egyptians themselves. This alternate history is echoed by parallel accounts from the myth and history of other ancient cultures, as well as myriad secret societies and occult sources. The remarkable number of parallels in these stories provides a unique window into this other Egypt.<\/p> <p>A new kind of counterculture is emerging around the unexpected discoveries of a small but growing circle of scientists, authors and researchers. The focal point of this counterculture centers on an alternative interpretation of ancient Egypt - not as mankind's earliest attempts at primitive civilization, but as a fully developed, and inexplicably advanced culture, who's scientific and metaphysical achievements we are only beginning to fully appreciate.<\/p> <p><b>All Are Welcome!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/224408676\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Circle of Spiritual Inquiry - Magical Egypt: The Invisible Science","id":"fpbtflytlblc","time":1440801000000,"updated":1440812983000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":28,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":4,"created":1438393607000,"fee":{"amount":7,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u2022\u00a0<b>ABSOLUTELY NO CLEATS ALLOWED (for both real grass and artificial grass)!

It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them whenever and however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p><br\/>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free.

In the Shire, in the west of Eriador, tales of Bilbo Baggins\u2019 outlandish adventure to the Lonely Mountain and back with a company of dwarves and that meddlesome wizard, Gandalf, have passed into local legend, and life has settled back into its bucolic pace.<\/p> <p>But elsewhere in Middle-earth, the fragile peace that followed the Battle of the Five Armies has begun to erode.<\/p> <p>To the east, past the bounds of the Bree-land in the wilds of Eriador, the shadows that fell long ago when the Witch-king of Angmar waged war on the last men of N\u00famenor continue to deepen. Fell creatures inhabiting the ruins of the Kingdom of Arnor beckon for their kin from the Misty Mountains and beyond to join them.<\/p> <p>Further east still, in Wilderland, it is rumored that servants of the enemy have taken up dominion yet again in Southern Mirkwood.<\/p> <p>The D\u00fanedain remaining in Eriador are ever vigilant. But, with their diminishing numbers, can they keep the growing shadow at bay?

Check out our<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/RAWTRAIL\/photos\/26326892\/\">\u00a0photos<\/a>\u00a0and comments from the past trips.<\/p> <p><br\/>There are lots of ways to enjoy a day at North-South Lake Campground, but the main point of interest to us is probably the <b>famous Escarpment Trail<\/b>. If you have never heard of this trail, take a look here:<a href=\"http:\/\/escarpmenttrail.com\/\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/escarpmenttrail.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/escarpmenttrail.com\/<\/a><\/a> This is one of the most beautiful places for hiking and trail running in New York state.<\/p> <p>Here is a video from the 2013 Escarpment\u00a0 Trail race:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/71310538\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/vimeo.com\/71310538<\/a><\/p> <p>Please note that we are not doing the entire trail (if you really want to do all 19 miles,\u00a0let me know and we'll figure out how to set it up). Also, if you're interested on doing this trip on Sunday, let me know.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I \u00a0will get you there and back and will take care of the day pass to the campground, and also we'll have lots of fruit and bottled water for everyone. We'll also have few picnic\/beach \u00a0blankets.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will start hiking\/running at North-South lake campground. I suggest doing about 5 miles of the trail (to the crashed airplane, or maybe a bit further), and then turning around. I will be staying at the back of the group, and faster hikers\/runners can go ahead of us if they want to.<\/p> <p><br\/>The beauty of this plan is that it's impossible to get lost. The trail is VERY EASY TO FOLLOW (it is well-marked with blue markers) so you can go at your own pace and turn around when you feel like it. Just be sure to get back on time before we leave (5pm sharp).<\/p> <p><br\/>You are welcome to hike with anyone else in the group, but all abilities are welcome and everyone can enjoy this trail at their own pace.\u00a0 The trail is rugged and at times very steep. Please prepare accordingly. There is no any water on the trail, so be sure to have enough with you. On weekends there are lots of people hiking there, so we certainly won't be alone there.<\/p> <p><b>Other activities that you might choose to enjoy during our trip to the campground: <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>- hiking around the lake,<\/p> <p><br\/>- visiting scenic spot of Mountain House,<\/p> <p><br\/>- renting a boat (availability might be limited),<\/p> <p><br\/>- lake swimming (in the designated area),<\/p> <p><br\/>- suntanning and enjoying the beach.<\/p> <p>More information about the campground is here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/outdoor\/24487.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/outdoor\/24487.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/outdoor\/24487.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Map of the campground is here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/docs\/permits_ej_operations_pdf\/northsouthlake2015.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/docs\/permits_ej_operations_pdf\/northsouthlake2015.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/docs\/permits_ej_operations_pdf\/northsouthlake2015.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/1\/3\/600_440542291.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>There are nice showers and bathrooms right by the beach (which is also our parking area and starting\/finishing point of the hike\/run).

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p>We'll play 3 simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with goals. There will be 6 teams on the field and we will play three games, 30 minutes\/game. Every 30 minutes we will have a short break and teams will switch to play against different team. Please check your email or our meetup message board on friday night or before 12.00pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p>If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.<\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>Riverside Park\u00a0at West\u00a0107 &amp; 108 Street<\/p> <p>Take the 1 RED Line Train to Cathedral Pkwy an walk two blocks down,\u00a0to 108th Street and Riverside Dr.<\/p> <p>The field is down the lower level near the river.

school, and it's also cooler in the AMs. Plus, you get to start your day off right! :)<\/p> <p>Welcome!<\/p> <p><br\/>If you love to play basketball, but height is not your advantage, come out and play with people who aren't excessively tall! In the tradition of Spud Webb, anyone under 5'8\", male or female, is welcome to join us on the court. We'll get some teams together and play some competitive, but relaxed bball-- and without any giant hands in our faces! :-p<\/p> <p>We rent out the gym from 5:00-8:00pm. Please arrive at least 5-10 minutes early as the sooner everyone arrives, the sooner we can begin playing. Note that all games stop at 7:45pm as we have to be out of the gym by 8:00pm. (If you get there late, please only ring the bell once. It is very loud! And it takes us a few minutes to get downstairs.) The gym is on the 10th fl. &amp; has adjoining bathrooms, lockers, and water fountains.<\/p> <p>We'll hit up McSwiggans (393 2nd Avenue @ 23rd St) later! Don't forget:<\/p> <p>* You must be no more than 5'8\" to play!<\/p> <p>* You must RSVP on the site in order to attend!<\/p> <p>* You will be asked to sign a waiver for 2014 as we're not a litigious group. If you have any problems with the prepay, just shoot one of the organizers an email.<\/p> <p>Here are the basic rules we follow for games: 1. Play by ones and twos to 11 - win by one point.<\/p> <p>2. Make it - take it.<\/p> <p>3. Backcourt if the ball hits the rim or backboard. Air balls are fair game to put right back up.<\/p> <p>4. Jump balls\/disputed calls will be determined by a three pointer since the laws of basketball physics are very clear that \"the ball never lies.\"<\/p> <p>5. Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds. 6. Subs will enter the game no later than 6 points in (once one of the teams reaches 6 points). The sub will start the following game. Teams will regulate themselves but let's make sure everyone plays.<\/p> <p>See you on the court! B-)<\/p> <p>***NOTE***<\/p> <p>In an effort for us to reduce overcrowding and to maintain a more accurate estimate of how many people to expect, please sign up online if you intend to play. There is a waiting list if all spots have been taken. We ask that you please just do not show up unannounced as you will kindly be asked to turned away. Also feel free to bring your own basketball for shoot-around. And don't forget to clip your nails prior to game day. We tried playing with Edward Scissorhands once - it didn't turn out so well.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Basketball-for-the-vertically-challenged\/events\/222918189\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"duration":9900000,"name":"Summer mornings pickup games","id":"xqkkhlytlbmc","time":1440856800000,"updated":1440868296000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1284011099000,"name":"[New York Co-Ed]  Basketball for the Vertically Challenged","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1703973,"urlname":"Basketball-for-the-vertically-challenged","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"bball shorties"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"71 Noble Street","name":"Brooklyn Expo Center","lon":-73.95817,"id":23713923,"lat":40.728416,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.24086332321,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438095190000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>What is Waku Waku?

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for. Thank you, Lynn\" Bodhi Meditation Class Saturday March 14, 2015<\/p> <p>\n\n\"I have tried many different forms of meditation and yoga over the years. Though I have experienced some positive changes practicing over the years I never felt committed to practice on regular basis. Nan takes it to a whole other level. How and why? All I can say is you have to experience it for yourself. There is power in simplicity,love, and truth. Despite some language barriers(which are minor) You can feel her love and healing energy. Open your mind and see with a different set of eyes. I highly recommend her special Saturday classes.\" Michelina, Bodhi Meditation class Saturday November 15, 2014<\/p> <p>\u201c\u00a0My first time today. Nan is very helpful and dedicated. I enjoyed it immensely and I did experience a shift in energy. I feel more alert, relaxed and focused even as I write this testimony. I plan on attending her next class in Freeport.\" Michelina, Bodhi Meditation class September 17, 2014<\/p> <p>\u201c Very strong healing energy tonight. I got there feeling very tired. I had stomach pain all day, and during the first meditation of the evening it got a lot better. By the end I wasn't thinking about it at all. I left full of energy. \u201d Pam, Bodhi Meditation class November 22, 2013<\/p> <p>\u201c\u00a0I didn't realize I would be reaping the benefits of Bodhi Med so quickly after attending only two classes. After my second class I felt even more relaxed. I have insomnia, but after the second session I fell asleep faster and deeper which has not happened for a long time.\u00a0\u201d Dee, Bodhi Meditation class September 18, 2013<\/p> <p>\"I have been attending these classes for three weeks. They are amazing. Nan is wonderful! My energy level is shifting and I am beginning to experience an ongoing sense of well-being with balance and relaxation.

Up to 8 people.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nCome and experience how this unique meditation can help you purify your body\/mind and unleash the creative power within you.<\/p> <p>* Increase self-awareness<\/p> <p>* Stronger emotional intelligence<\/p> <p>* Greater mental clarity, focus and inspiration.<\/p> <p>Bodhi Meditation<\/p> <p>Energize your body<\/p> <p>Strengthen your mind<\/p> <p>Bodhi Meditation is a form of energy healing.<\/p> <p>Bodhi Meditation is unique in the following ways<\/p> <p>1). It channels universal energy rather than working with what\u2019s within one person. It transcends the genetic and physical limits of just one being by relying and drawing energy from the entire universe.<\/p> <p>2). The entire human body is the receiver of this energy. The energy\u2019s effects on the body do not rely on certain meridian paths or pressure points of the body, which are the common requirements for many types of the Qi Gong practices.<\/p> <p>Students will experience two forms of Bodhi Meditation.<\/p> <p>* Seated<\/p> <p>* Movement<\/p> <p>Your class instructor is Nan Ni Gilbert. Nan is a NYS licensed acupuncturist and Chinese herbalist. Nan is also one of the most advanced Bodhi Meditation energy healer in North America.<\/p> <p>Feel free to ask Nan your personal health questions after the class.<\/p> <p>Please arrive early for class intro\/setup.<\/p> <p>Class basic info:<\/p> <p>* Loose fitting clothes is recommended but not required.<\/p> <p>* Some people bring their own yoga mat for the seated meditation part. This is not a requirement as we have chairs for everyone.<\/p> <p>* Cellphones needed to be turned off during the class.<\/p> <p>Here is the internet link if you are interested in purchasing the meditation music used in the class.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\">&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\"&gt;<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\">&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\"&gt;<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\">&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\"&gt;<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\">&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\"&gt;<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\">&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\"&gt;<\/a>\u00a0----------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>\n\n\nI leave you with Master JinBodhi's Golden Words:<\/p> <p>(Editor's note: The following phrases were suggested by Master JinBodhi and subsequently introduced to his students as a daily practice.

This challenge is about creating a series of pictures that have\u00a0ONE thing in common: an object within the same color (tone). I will let you choose ONE color for that day. Don't cheat. Stick to the color, see things you normally would ignore or oversee. It's easier to focus on ONE thing. I'm sure the result will be a great series of pictures.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/3\/a\/600_440660026.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We will meet at the boardwalk in front of the East Coast Memorial in Battery Park. That's the big open plaza with the gigantic eagle statue. From there, we will make our way to Governor's Island. The ferry leaves @ 11:30 sharp, that will be the last FREE ferry for the day. So please be on time.\u00a0Governor's Island ferry terminal is located just next to the Staten Island Ferry Terminal, the green kinda old looking building.<\/p> <p>We will wonder through the beautiful island as individuals or smaller groups,\u00a0\u00a0check out the temporary art\/ architecture pavilions, the old fortress\u00a0and may have a nap in the\u00a0hammocks ;)\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Bathrooms availability is a little limited on the island, but you'll find some potties here and there. For those who want to stick around, we can meet later again and grab some food together. There are choices on the island or in Manhattan or Brooklyn.

Even many\u00a0the most well-meaning Self Help Gurus preach a life full of happiness. The problem is that this is very often in discordance with life itself. This pressure\u00a0can leave us feeling like something is terribly wrong with us when we're not as blissfully giddy as everyone's news feed reflects.<\/p> <p>Very often, the feeling of \"distress\" we dread isn't created by\u00a0our negative\u00a0emotions, but rather it's\u00a0manifested\u00a0from the internal struggle and\u00a0fight we experience when\u00a0trying to avoid or push these\u00a0feelings away. This can present itself in ways such as getting angry at oneself for feeling down, over-doing\u00a0happy hour to avoid being still with one's\u00a0thoughts, or even by hiding these experiences from those around us. By allowing these negative thoughts and emotions\u00a0in a safe and non-judgmental way, we can begin to bring some more compassion to our experiences and be more in harmony with our bodies and our lives.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Through Enodia Center's unique\u00a0<b>Life in Balance Meditation<\/b>, we'll practice validating both\u00a0Positive and Negative Emotions, and seeing them for what they are:\u00a0normal, vital aspects of Our Human Experience.<\/p> <p>At this Meetup, we'll connect and talk about the topic via informal group discussion, then experience a full guided Life in Balance Meditation, followed by Q&amp;A, connecting with other like-minded women, warm tea, and light refreshments (aka chocolate.)<\/p> <p><i>What to expect:<\/i><\/p> <p><i>All of Enodia Center\u2019s sessions, Studio Series, and community events are designed to be realistic for every woman.

The parade route will start at 322 Nassau Road in Roosevelt, New York (Western Beef) parking lot and will end on Nicholas Court in Hempstead, NY where the festival will be held at.<br\/>The Third Annual Long Island African American parade and the 33rd TAHAD Festival is set to be the driving force in strengthening families, bringing unity in the community and embracing culture. We are thrilled to have Meli\u2019sa Morgan who is a 2014 Soul Train Music Award Nominee R&amp;B Songstress and was also featured on TV One Unsung. Meli'sa Morgan is known for her 80\u2019s hit \u201cDo Me Baby\u201d and will be our main performer at the festival. The parade and festival is set to host a variety of performances that will have you dancing and singing throughout the day. There will be a variety of fine cuisines that will be serviced by our vendors.\u00a0<br\/>A Health Pavilion will be available for you to sign up for health insurance and free health screenings will be available to the community.\u00a0 African Americans are at the highest risk for diabetes and high blood pressure so it\u2019s very imperative that you get a health screening that will be provided at the festival. The Kiddy Corner will be available for children to enjoy activities in a family friendly environment.<br\/>The African American Heritage Parade and Festival objectives are to showcase the richness of the African American community on Long Island, educate our youth and allow them to experience African American pride by embracing its legacy. Our Seven Grand Marshalls will be introducing the Seven Principals of Kwanzaa with the purpose of contributing in building and reinforcing family, community and culture among African American people as well as Africans throughout the world.\u00a0<br\/>These values are called the <i>Nguzo Saba<\/i> which in Swahili means the Seven Principles. Developed by Dr. Karenga, the <i>Nguzo Saba<\/i> stands at the heart of the origin and meaning of Kwanzaa, for it is these values which are not only the building blocks for community but also serve to reinforce and enhance them.<br\/>Vending opportunities are available and performing artists are encouraged to contact us today.

Fake or otherwise. I want you to all have fun, and not get into trouble or kicked out of a place because of your weapons.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

(You would need me to log in, in order to install stuff.) Same thing goes with the ps3 and other consoles.<\/p> <p>3. Take turns, If one group of people want to play a group game or show a group thing, share it and take turns. Do not use the projector or TV for more then 2 hours, unless the group agrees to continue the same activity. There is the projector and the TV in my room.<\/p> <p>DIRECTIONS!<\/p> <p>My house is in NJ, but it is super easy to get to from NYC. Just go to NYC penn station on 34st and 7th ave. From there, take \"NJ transit\" to \"Elizabeth\". (It will cost you $13.50 round trip.) my house is only 1.3 miles from the train station. Note: Get off at \"Elizabeth\" NOT \"north Elizabeth.\".<\/p> <p>Train times<\/p> <p>(WILL BE UPDATED AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE DATE)<\/p> <p>Important info about the trains<\/p> <p>The party ends at 10:00pm. At this time, I will be offering rides back to the train station. The last train that leaves Elizabeth and goes back to NYC penn station leaves at 1:59 am. So please plan ahead. Unless you want to wait til 6 am to leave, however!!!<\/p> <p>CARPOOLING FROM THE TRAIN STATION TO THE HOUSE, INFO...<\/p> <p><br\/>VOLUNTEERS NEEDED FOR CARPOOLING (I am requesting anyone with a car, if they would be willing to carpool people from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, you will be tipped $3 per person if you do. (People who are carpooling, should be tipping you.) Volunteer Driver list so far...<\/p> <p>Rye_B (Myself) - 2003 Red Ford Escape (Limit 4 Passengers)<\/p> <p>NOTE: Myself and other people will be car pooling people from 10:00 am to noon. After that, people will have to walk. (I just ask for 3 dollars per person, if I am carpooling you or if someone else is carpooling you. So please tip the drivers. ) You can sleep over, however I have to limit it to 10 people sleeping over, due to limited space. People who drove here get priority. For those of you who are DRIVING and have a very long ride back home, you can sleep over. My bedroom is big and I can fit many people in it. I also have a Guest bedroom. I will be checking the comments for people who say they are at the station. However I understand that not everyone one has internet on their phone. So, call or text me at \"9 O eight - 5 seven eight - two 4 nine 4\" (I typed my phone number in a strange way to prevent spam bots from picking it up and giving me telemarketers.)<\/p> <p>NOTE: On the off chance that the weather is bad. Then, I will move the party inside the house. I will also update this with more details as we get closer! ALSO the FOOD and DRINK LIST IS below!<\/p> <p>NOTE (FOOD): If you feel that you want to bring something else besides what is listed below, then by all means do so. the bottom is a suggested list.

This expertise is different than what's called \"recorded sound,\" which is the way music is recorded in the recording studio.<\/p> <p>Most classes and workshops exclusively focus on \"recorded sound\" techniques and can leave performers without vital skills when they go on stage to perform live. If you've ever taken ProTools classes or recording classes, you are still a beginner in live sound techniques and are in need of this workshop.<\/p> <p>Is this Workshop for You?<\/p> <p>This interactive live sound workshop is for you if you are doing gigs (or looking to do gigs) and want to know how to communicate clearly and professionally with the live sound engineers in NYC venues.<\/p> <p>After completing the workshop you will also be able to do basic sound for yourself if you encounter the NYC venues that require this skill. (Surprisingly, there are some great ones that have the bartender point you to the mixer and leave you to do it all yourself!)<\/p> <p>Who This Workshop is Not For<\/p> <p>This is not for anyone who already has extensive live sound experience. This is a beginner level class geared towards performers.<\/p> <p>If you are not a performer you are welcome to attend, but know that the class will be taught with the performer in mind.<\/p> <p>Skills You'll Learn<\/p> <p>\u2022 Mic Stand Setup Tricks<br\/>\u2022 Pro Cable Wrapping Techniques<br\/>\u2022 EQ, Compression, and Reverb<br\/>\u2022 Basics of the Mixer (Also known as a \"Sound

As the show begins, Hedwig is performing in concert and recounting her life story: childhood abuse, a disastrous marriage to an American soldier and, after being plunked down alone in Kansas, a doomed romantic and songwriting partnership with a Christian teen who becomes a rock star. Hedwig remains obsessed with this former love, Tommy Gnosis, and follows him on the road, accompanied by her loyal new husband, Yitzhak. By the end, our heroine embraces the fullness of her identity in one of the most electrifying scenes on Broadway.<\/p> <p><br\/>What Is Hedwig and the Angry Inch Like?On one level, Hedwig is an exciting rock concert powered by the charisma and sly humor of the glamorously bewigged, high-heeled title character. Songs like \u201cThe Origin of Love\u201d are both gorgeous and thought-provoking, performed by Hedwig and a four-man band (The Angry Inch) and backed by the powerful vocals of Yitzhak, a role played by a woman. Beneath the laughs is the moving story of a heroine desperate to find love and a sense of self-worth. John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask\u2019s groundbreaking 1998 off-Broadway musical has bloomed into a long-running Broadway hit.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>SEATS ARE LOCATED IN THE FRONT BALCONY<\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I will be standing in front of the marquee otherwise call me 212.991.8023","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Theatre-Maniacs\/events\/224436351\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Hedwig and the Angry Inch","id":"224436351","time":1440871200000,"updated":1441104584000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1287200322000,"name":"Theatre Maniacs","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1722890,"urlname":"Theatre-Maniacs","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Broadway Babies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10036","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"1230 6th Ave.,","name":"Rockefeller Center Concourse ","lon":-73.981049,"id":1602449,"state":"NY","lat":40.759018,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.780922889709,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440525269000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Not sure what to do with yourself after you've attended Nintendo World's Summer Fun event this Saturday?

It clears blockages in our energy channels so that our physical body can be healthier. The practitioner does not use his\/her energy, but is just a channel through which the energy flows. Reiki Tummo goes beyond traditional Reiki in that it is not just a healing modality, but also helps us to grow spiritually by opening our spiritual heart which is our connection to the Creator.

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

In New York, the opera, the theatre, and grand parties consumed the ruling class' leisure hours. Sherry's Restaurant hosted formal horseback dinners for the New York Riding Club. Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish once threw a dinner party to honor her dog who arrived sporting a $15,000 diamond collar. Millionaires built\u00a0stately and often gaudy homes in New York City. For example,\u00a0the childhood home of Huguette Clark, built in 1907 by her father,\u00a0William Andrews Clark, had 121 rooms, 31 baths, four art galleries, a swimming pool, and a private underground rail line to bring in coal for heating. It cost Clark $7M\u2014that's about $162M in today's dollars\u2014to build, but stood for only 20 years, bought by a developer after Clark's death for less than half the construction cost and demolished to make way for a wealthy apartment house at 960 Fifth Avenue.<\/p> <p>On this walking tour, we will discuss rich people's\u00a0grand\u00a0mansions, wraparound terraces,\u00a0extravagant weddings,\u00a0lavish parties, oversized carriage houses, conspicuous leisure,\u00a0costly hobbies, spacious apartments, prissy\u00a0social clubs, and wealth fest.<\/p> <p><b>This is a walking tour with much commentary.\u00a0We'll be walking about 2 1\/2\u00a0miles. We will be zigzagging around historic Carnegie Hill and the Upper East Side. There will be plenty of stopping at points of interest. If you don't like a lot of stopping, then this type of walk is not good for you. The tour lasts about 2 1\/2 hours.<\/b><\/p> <p>Below was the Carnegies\u2019 organ in the reception hall.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arrming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/224390193\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"name":"First game of the season on Sunday August 30th @ 9:00 am, RSVP open on Aug. 21st","id":"224390193","time":1440939600000,"updated":1440953979000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":2.62231636047,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1402585966000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>World Kitchen Garden Day<\/b> was initiated by Roger Doiron of Kitchen Gardeners International as \"an annual, decentralized celebration of food produced on a human-scale.

What exactly is this thing we do called sex and why are so obsessed with it? What makes it so pleasurable, titillating, frightening and shameful? Most of us think the other is satisfied, while we feel frustrated in our own desire and longing.<\/p> <p>The primary processes of sexuality are energetic patterns created in our childhood, which are then mediated through the body. Most of us are not even aware of these energetic habits, such as the difference between being separate or merged or even our own preferences and those of our partners. Unencumbered from such habits, sex can become fresh, alive and open, an art form, a physical prayer, naked, unafraid and raw. Beyond self union, lies a greater union, a total orgasm with the whole, with Source itself.<\/p> <p>This day long journey will be an exploration of how we can gain a conscious choosing over what and how our sexual energy moves. From pleasure to sharing, to heightening the spiritual embodiment of your sexuality, we will be in conscious exploration and discovery of these energies in you and how they affect your relationships.<\/p> <p>The Awakened Sexuality Project is for participants who are longing for a deep spiritual journey and a strong willingness to venture and play where angels fear to tread. We will be working in the deep unconscious, uncovering where we turn away from some of our greatest gifts by delving into what has been deemed unspeakable and taboo. Through exploration of sexual fantasies, sexual constellation work, untamed passions, conscious play, body work, breath work, movement, intimacy, connection and respectful service to each other, we can come home to ourselves through a deep honoring of our gorgeous, unique and individual ways of loving.<\/p> <p>When: Saturday Aug 30th, 2015, 10:00AM ~ 5:00 PM<br\/>Where: Institute of Core Energetics,<br\/>150 West 28th street, suite 1803, New York<\/p> <p>Admission: $150 before Aug 23rd, 2015, $175 after<\/p> <p>Tickets:<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/meeting-your-dark-attraction-sexual-fantasy-tickets-18192974677\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/meeting-your-dark-attraction-sexual-fantasy-tickets-18192974677<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/c\/1\/600_441028865.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Dr. Kincaid is the Director of The Institute of Integral Evolutionary Tantra, New York City.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last!
