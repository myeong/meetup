        "description": "<p>Who's up for some food and Baseball actions! Our next YBP event will be in Baltimore, on Saturday, August 15th 2015.\u00a0 It'll be a 2 for 1 where we visit the\u00a0 Muslim FoodFest 2015 first and then watch the Baltimore Orioles take on Oakland Athletics in Camden Yards!<\/p> <p><br\/>Muslim FoodFest 2015 offers great food and family fun; all while enjoying live entertainment program. Food will be available for purchase by vendors and a limited supply of sample sizes will also be available for a nominal fee. There's a $5 entrance ticket to the FoodFest and it runs from 12 PM - 10 PM. We'll most likely go as a YBP group at 4:30 PM. The festival is in Al Rahmah School Educational Trust (ASET) at 6631 Johnnycake Road, Baltimore, MD 21244<\/p> <p><br\/>After the FoodFest, we'll take a short drive to downtown Baltimore and watch the O's play the Oakland A's. Game starts at 7 PM. I have found tickets for $20\/person for GREAT seats (Lower Reserve Level 61, Row 11). If you've never been to a Baseball game, then you're in it for a treat! It's a classic American tradition to go a ballpark and enjoy the game\/crowd\/food. And don't worry, if you don't understand baseball, I'll explain you all the craziness!\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>IMPORTANT - <i>We encourage everyone to come to both events, but you're more than welcome to join either one if you can't make it to both. But due to limited amount of tickets to the baseball game, I'm setting a deadline of Saturday, August 1st to confirm who's going to the game. And if you confirm, then you need to PayPal me $20 so that I can get the tickets in a group. My PayPal email is [masked]. If you've never used PayPal before or need help, please don't hesitate to contact me.\u00a0\u00a0<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>This is going to be an awesome day and I hope to see everyone out there.<\/p>",

If you do not have the opportunity to do so, then no worries.<\/p> <p>Each meeting follows the Foundation for Shamanic Studies' general approach for teaching and building Core Shamanism and teaches journey techniques for all levels. \u00a0There is a discussion and topic presented with each class, and these themes are integrated into the journey work. If you are new to journeying, or are new to these classes, please come 15 minutes early (see below).<\/p> <p>There is lore within the Eddas as well that sheds light on how the shamanic path was treated historically in Europe. While this class supports any religion and faith, and requires tolerance to the diversity of religious traditions within cultures, it does have more of a focus on classic mystery traditions.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you don't know how to journey, please contact Christian (xtian) in advance, although this step is not necessary. A brief introduction to journeying is available for beginners and experienced journeyers new to our group. \u00a0If so, please show up about 15 minutes early.<\/p> <p>This monthly journey group will help students of all levels build the divine connections to their teachers and\/or power animals. Each session will consist of two journeys, and will allow a community to share questions and have structured feedback on how to improve your skills in journeying, as well as strengthen your subtle bodies for spiritual work no matter what your personal religious calling may be.<\/p> <p>$10 donation sliding scale is appreciated. \u00a0Donations support the group meetups and our larger community events!<\/p> <p><b>Notes on what you should bring, and requests:<\/b><\/p> <p>If you feel more comfortable lying down, bring a yoga mat or comfortable pad that you wish.<\/p> <p>If you have a rattle or shamanic drum that is not too loud, please do bring that.<\/p> <p>Bring a notebook and pen, or some thing to take notes on!<\/p> <p>Bring water for personal hydration. \u00a0Please try not to eat a very large meal immediately before the class. Heavy foods can interfere with this work, especially if spiritual work is new to you. \u00a0I do encourage a light snack however, as a starving student can be equally distracted.<\/p> <p>Finally, please be on time. \u00a0We will spend the first 15 minutes sharing and learning, and then begin our first journey. \u00a0If you do arrive once the journeying has begun, be quiet and respectful, and take the time to journey for yourself.<\/p> <p>Be respectful and turn off all cell phones and pagers during the event.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Hey Guys,<\/p> <p>Last year we competed in the Purple Heart Charity 3D Shoot hosted by the Heart of Maryland Bowhunters Club. It's a fun shoot and since it's for charity it is not very competitive.<\/p> <p>Cost: $15, and 100% of proceeds go directly to benefit Disabled Veterans through NPLB and Operation Second Chance<\/p> <p>What: A 3D shoot that is held outdoors. There is a 30 target course. You hike from one to the next and the targets are 3D foam animals. All targets are at different distances and and will range from 10 to 50 yards away. Furthermore, you will not be told the distance but will have to estimate it and one can't see the target on the animal from far away so binoculars are needed or a cheat sheet of where the kill shots are. Sounds difficult I know, but these challenges make it so much more exciting!<\/p> <p>The only negative thing about 3Ds is that even seasoned shooters are likely to lose a couple arrows. This is the sacrifice you make at a 3D shoot but it is well worth it!<\/p> <p>I will unfortunately not be able to make it this year as I will be out of town. So, contact George if you are interested in going - [masked] ,[masked]-8424. It's in Marriottsville, so I recommend you work with him to co-ordinate carpools.<\/p> <p>Hope you can make it!<\/p> <p>-Natasha<\/p>",

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\". That way, we know not to be waiting for you. Thanks.<\/b><\/p> <p>So come join us on Sunday for a brisk walk in the park. It's a great way to clean out the cobwebs and start a Sunday.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

From the new couple, to the new baby, and even the new house hold pet. And from head shots to three quarter, to full length portraits.<\/p> <p>Learning how to use the light in different environments, and creating a pose that brings out the persons best is harder than it seems. You may have seen some wonderful poses, and you've probably seen some awkward looking portraits. Knowing the differences of a good pose based on the subjects body type, and how to use light and posing to make your subject feel and look their best is key!<\/p> <p>We will be using daylight, flash (mono-lights and speed lights) in the studio and on location. Creating poses in these different environments to get the best portrait possible.<\/p> <p>If you are just starting out or an up and coming shooting looking for know more about your camera, light, and posing for a better portrait this is the workshop for you.<\/p> <p>In this month's workshop we will shooting Anastasia, Jessica, Laurese, and Liana.<\/p> <p>We hope to see you all there!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/f\/6\/600_439905302.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

We hold study group on the fourth Sunday of each moth from 3:30-4:45 pm where we explore various traditional scriptures such as the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, as well as contemporary spiritual texts. Community service projects happen each month too \u2014ask us about these when you visit!<\/p> <p>Join us outdoors at Ruscombe the first Saturday of each month from 4-5:15 pm for our month fire ceremony (havan). Havan is a traditional fire ceremony that is performed to bring balance and healing to nature and to ourselves.<\/p> <p>We invite you to join us on the path of \u201cLiving our Yoga\u201d.<\/p> <p>For more information visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiseheartcommunity.org\">www.wiseheartcommunity.org<\/a> or email Christine Garrison <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a><\/p>",

Yet\u00a0 the very technology designed for our well-being often serves only to isolate us from one another and distance us from the experience of all that is truly divine.<\/p> <p><br\/>The Bhakti Lounge is a place where incredible transformation and healing takes place all through the culture of bhakti. Meditation, Kirtan, Discussions on the Bhagavad Gita and other ancient texts from the Vedic tradition , Vegetarian food prepared using Bhakti &amp; Ayurvedic principles create an environment where lifelong friendships are made. As one yogi remarked\" I finally found a\u00a0 community of kindred spirits\"<\/p> <p><br\/>We meet every Sunday on 200 Bloomsbury Avenue Catonsville, MD from 6 pm to 8 pm. Please join us to create a sacred circle of love and devotion and bring bliss\/ananda in the Baltimore region and beyond.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nHope to see you soon!<\/p>",

Here is the Firebase Pitch:<\/p> <p>Firebase is a platform that powers your app's backend, including data storage, user authentication, static hosting, and more. Firebase enables you to build fast by reducing the complexity of full-stack applications, allowing you to focus on what matters: creating extraordinary user experiences.<\/p> <p>In his talk he will endeavor to answer the following questions:<\/p> <p>What is Firebase, what makes it different, and why is it important?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0 What makes Firebase + AngularJS + Node.js an awesome stack?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What does one need to know in order to use Firebase?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0 What are examples of what Firebase can be used to accomplish?<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0 How well does Firebase perform in various example contexts?<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0 Does Firebase work at both the MVP stage and at scale?<\/p> <p><br\/>The talk will focus on Implementing powerful realtime applications with Firebase, AngularJS, and a dash of Node.js, Also included will be a discussion of adding Firebase to your full-stack workflow, building a client-only app with ease using AngularFire, integrating Firebase with Node.js to achieve autonomous functionality, and transitioning from an MVP to an application at scale.<\/p> <p>We will also explore examples of applications currently using Firebase, and live-code a full-stack app with Firebase, AngularJS, and a hint of Node.js.<\/p> <p>Sinan received his B.S. in computer science from Northwestern University in 2014 and has been building realtime applications with Firebase ever since. His background is in computer systems and interfaces, with a focus on databases, wireless sensor networks, and human computer interaction. He is returning to Northwestern for his masters to study realtime systems and spatio-temporal databases. Sinan loves the smell of gasoline and quotes lines from \"the Fast and the Furious\" often.<\/p>",

The Scenarios for Adventure 1 and Adventure 3 are also available at the store and can be run by anyone with a copy of the core card game and the relevant Adventure Deck numbers. If you can bring a core game please list that with your RSVP so we can expand the number of player seats.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Adventure 0-2 - A Pirate's Life<\/b><\/p> <p>Yo ho! A pirate\u2019s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\u2019s more to a pirate\u2019s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\u2019s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate\u2019s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\u2019s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.<\/p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that\u2019s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there\u2019s power, there\u2019s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play, as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we are sure we have space for, but if there is more interest, we can almost certainly make more room. So please sign up for the wait list if you want to play.<\/p> <p>3.

Until-a new, nasty custodian turned us in to the Vice Principal, who sent an e-mail to the Rec council who forwarded it to us. We then had to be out of the gym 10:30 PM sharp, NO EXCEPTIONS.

Scroll down to \"What to Expect\" for details.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b> WE START ON TIME.<\/b> If someone's up at the counter ordering, or even if they show up late -- we start on time anyway. Nothing personal, just the way I do things.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b> WE END ON TIME.<\/b> Meetups last 90 minutes. We finish up, then we take a group photo. You'll be out the door within ten minutes of when we finish.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b> LAW OF ATTRACTION. <\/b>\u00a0We don't teach Law of Attraction. This meetup is for people who already get it with LoA.<\/p> <p>If you'd like to learn about Law of Attraction, read \"Ask and It Is Given\" and \"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent\" by Jerry and Esther Hicks, or visit their website:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.abraham-hi\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.abraham-hi<\/a>...<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>WHAT TO EXPECT\u00a0in a Processes Mini-Workshop<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>I'LL DEMO THE PROCESS WITH A VOLUNTEER: <\/b>You'll see an example of the process during the demo. The volunteer gets to do two processes: one in the demo and one when we all do it together.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>WHAT TO DO YOUR PROCESS ON: <\/b>Pick contrasting situations that are mild and\/or recent. We want something easy enough that we can make progress on it in the short time we'll have together. (If nothing seems \"easy\" then pick whatever is most recent.)<\/p> <p>Everyone's process will be shared with the group. Make sure you're willing for others to hear what you're working on. Nothing deeply personal or private, please.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>IF YOU'RE LATE: <\/b>You can still participate by doing Appreciations as your process. Don't worry that you'll be missing out; you'll definitely pick up a lot from hearing the other processes. So if you're delayed, please still join us.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>ALL ABE, ALL THE TIME -<\/b> All of us are probably into related teachings and practices, and it's natural that we bring some of that in. And since it can get hard to know where to draw the line, I just draw the line at Abraham. If it isn't \"straight Abe\" then I bring things back to Abraham.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>WHEN A COMMENT CONTRADICTS THE ABRAHAM MATERIAL, I SAY SO.<\/b> This is the Abraham meetup group. When someone makes a statement that is contrary to what Abraham teaches, I speak up because we're focused on the Abraham material here. If you're the one who makes a statement and I say, \"Well, actually, what Abraham says about that is XYZ,\" -- it's not about you. It's just to keep us 'honest' with the Abraham material.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>SOME FOLKS CHAT AFTERWARDS - <\/b>We naturally get to know bits of each other's lives as we discuss how this quote or that one pertains to us. Aside from that, we do not use meetup time for getting to know each other personally. Often a few people will linger to talk to each other afterwards. But our aim is to use the meetup time for \"Abe work\" and not for socializing.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>To learn about Law of Attraction<\/b>, check the website of Jerry and Esther Hicks:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.abraham-hicks.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.abraham-hicks.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.abraham-hicks.com<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\nTo subscribe to my newsletter with short daily articles on Law of Attraction, click through here and sign up:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/passionforlawofattraction.com\/subscribe-to-p4l0a-newsletter\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/passionforlawofattraction.com\/subscribe-to-p4l0a-newsletter\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/passionforlawofattraction.com\/subscribe-to-p4l0a-newsletter\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>",

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>",

Full details will be posted the Sunday before the game. Hope you can join us!<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------<\/p> <p>UPDATES:<\/p> <p>Here's some logistical info:<\/p> <p>1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Bring $10 cash, meet at 6:20 pm.<\/p> <p>2. I'll email my cell phone number to everyone Tuesday morning.\u00a0 Check your email, and if you don't have it by noon on Tuesday, please contact before 2 pm at<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Md\/message\/?recipientId=5312826\"><a href=\"https:\/\/secure.meetup.com\/messages\/?new_convo=true&amp;member_id=5312826&amp;name=Allen\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/secure.meetup.com\/messages\/?new_convo=true&amp;member_id=5312826&amp;name=Allen<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>3. We'll meet at 6:20 pm at the memorial at the corner of W. Lee Street and Ravens' Walk (the pedestrian walkway between the Ravens' and Orioles' stadiums). The memorial is inscribed \"Time Will Not Dim the Glory of Their Deeds\". The exact location is marked by the red (or green) thingy on this map:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?daddr=39.28206,-76.6207&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=17&amp;t=h\"><a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?daddr=39.28206,-76.6207&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=17&amp;t=h\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?daddr=39.28206,-76.6207&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=17&amp;t=h<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>4. At 6:30 pm sharp, we'll walk up to the ticket window together and buy tickets.\u00a0 Please bring $10 in CASH to pay for your ticket.<\/p> <p>5. If you're running late, call me on my cell before 6:30 pm and we'll either wait a few minutes for you, or we'll head in and let you know where we're sitting.<\/p> <p>6. You can park at the stadium for $8.\u00a0 Again, bring cash.<\/p> <p>7. If anyone would like to ride up with me from the Laurel\/Columbia area, please let me know.\u00a0 I'm going to be leaving as soon after 5 pm as possible--definitely no later than 5:15.<\/p> <p>8. You're allowed to bring your own water, soda and snacks into the stadium. Those are often nice to have.<\/p> <p>9. A baseball cap is a good idea. It shields your eyes from the overhead field lights and makes it easier to see.<\/p> <p>10. It will be sunny and hot Tuesday with a small chance of scattered showers.\u00a0 We'll get tickets in the shade and under the roof so any sun or passing rain won't bother us :-).<\/p> <p><br\/>See everyone Tuesday nite!<\/p>",

Come to this session to learn what \u00a0 we do and why it\u2019s bad to the database server (or your \u00a0 career)\u2026 and alternatives that can be used instead. Some \u00a0 of the topics that we\u2019ll discuss are the pitfalls of using \u00a0 NOLOCK, how coding mistakes open up the database for SQL \u00a0 Injection attacks, and how design choices keep SQL Server \u00a0 dumb \u2013 and if it was allowed to be smart, it would be \u00a0 faster!

It's the August Multi-Organizational Business Networking Breakfast! Bring plenty of business cards and your appetite for a hot breakfast and structured networking.<\/p> <p>Here's how it works: When you arrive, check in, grab your name badge, and take a seat. Breakfast will be announced shortly after you get settled (you may be able to grab a coffee before the food comes out). Make sure you are sitting with people that are new to you! Your first \"rotation\" will be with the initial people at your table, so introduce yourself, share information, and collect\/distribute business cards. Welcome announcements and acknowledgements will take place, followed by two or three more rounds of networking. Each round will require you to get up from your chair and relocate yourself to another table where you will start the process all over again! Depending on the number at your table, you will have between 60 and 90 seconds to introduce yourself and tell your tablemates about your business, so prepare and practice your \"elevator speech\" early! This breakfast is hosted by the Baltimore Washington Corridor Chamber of Commerce and will be attended by chambers and business groups throughout the area.<\/p> <p>Did you know that Entrepreneur's Exchange introduced the concept of the \"joint breakfast\" years ago? It's like speed dating but you meet 8 to 10 new people in each round. EE participates in six or more joint networking breakfasts each year at different locations throughout the Baltimore\/Washington area, traditionally hosting the summer breakfast in Annapolis in June. Other participating organizations include local chambers of commerce, business networking groups, technology groups, and more. Don't miss the opportunity to meet business owners and entrepreneurs from around the area and make a lot of connections - sign up for the next joint breakfast and see what all the buzz is about!<\/p>",

The weekly report (issued on Wednesdays) includes which plants are up, ripe, or in the correct stage for harvesting in the Baltimore\/Annapolis\/DC area, as well as some basic information such as Latin &amp; common names, which part part of the plant is edible now, where it commonly grows, and some basic nutritional information. The report includes wild edible greens, shoots, roots, tubers, stalks, berries, fungi, nuts, &amp; seeds, and is intended to be a complement to other study on wild edible plants, whether through classes or independent research. The report does\u00a0<i>not<\/i> include detailed identification guidance, or details on processing, cooking, or preserving wild plants. For in-depth learning through classes or workshops on foraging, processing, cooking, or medicine making with wild plants, please visit Charm City Farm's other programming.<\/p> <p>The report runs March 18- Dec 16, for a total of 40 issues. Subscribers can join at any time throughout the year. Subscription is $10 per email address.<\/p> <p>The Charm City Farms Forage Report is authored by Victoria Greba, a Baltimore based nature instructor specializing in the use of wild plants.<\/p> <p>To view a sample report and to subscribe please visit\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.charmcityfarms.org\/foragers-of-baltimore\/subscribe-to-charm-city-farms-forage-report\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.charmcityfarms.org\/foragers-of-baltimore\/subscribe-to-charm-city-farms-forage-report\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.charmcityfarms.org\/foragers-of-baltimore\/subscribe-to-charm-city-farms-forage-report\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/0\/0\/event_435870720.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Here is an opportunity for some fun wrenching and having a bolt on lift kit installed on a tighter budget. This is an exclusive event for Mud Puppy Jeepers. World Tour started as wrenching parties. It's come a long way from a driveway to a hobby shop in Odenton to a full service pro shop in Annapolis. In the spirit of not forgetting where we've come from I'd like to keep ahold of our wrenching party beginnings. This is where you all come in. So I'm looking to open our doors for a monthly wrenching party. Of course there is a bit of a catch. We want the lift kit to come from us. It'll be the regular retail price you'd pay anywhere else. The second catch is that you need to provide a minimum of four wrenchers. I don't care if you've never ever seen a wrench but you will know what one is by the end of the day. If for some reason you don't feel like it's for you to help with the wrenching this isn't a real problem. Just recruit four willing volunteers who are. If you can help yourself you only need to find three.<\/p> <p>I'll be able to do one of these a month if the interest is here.<\/p> <p>A few of the great companies we represent for lift kits.<\/p> <p>AEV (american expeditionary vehicles), metal cloak, rock crawler, currie, teraflex, pro comp, synergy, and fab tech.<\/p> <p>Four people with the right tools and direction can get a bolt on kit installed fairly quickly.<\/p> <p>Who's gonna be the first one?<\/p>",

(Note: if you don\u2019t want to wait up for slower riders, this is NOT the ride for you, but please also survey your current fitness, as no one likes to be the one person holding up a larger group). \u00a0Please also note Ptap rides tend to be about 1 mph slower than Rosy, or Fairland, due terrain. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Terrain:<\/b> Ranges from Easy to Difficult. Most trails are in great shape, but plan on some mud spots. There are a few very steep climbs, rocks and technical sections, log overs (up to 10\" logs, and 3' stacks), tight single track (12\" wide in spots), and a stream crossing or two. \u00a0A strong\/advanced rider will be able to clean most sections, others will need to get off of their bikes in spots. \u00a0This is a friendly ride, so we will wait up for everyone, just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places. \u00a0This is a video edit I made from last fall through winter. \u00a0We won't hit all of this terrain, but gives you a feel for Patapsco:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Distance:<\/b>\u00a0With days getting longer we will be minimally getting 10 miles, and if conditions and light allow, we will push towards 20. \u00a0Exact route will change depending on group dynamics, trail conditions, daylight, etc. \u00a0I will typically have route planned in my head at the beginning of the ride, but will modify as needed to get us back at a reasonable time. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Duration:<\/b> I shoot to have us back before it gets dark (so 2 to 3 hours as the days get longer). \u00a0This can change with mechanical issues, and group dynamics though. \u00a0As this is a weekday ride, the stops will be just long enough for the last rider to catch their breath. \u00a0Note: wheels roll at stated time, so please don\u2019t be late.<\/p> <p><b>Bring:<\/b> Helmet (required), water (as much as you can carry), spare tube\/patch kit, pump\/CO2, multi-tool, I.D., emergency contact info where it can be easily located on your person, and a good attitude, as this ride is as much about camaraderie as it is about riding. Take a look at your bike and make sure it is in good working condition (Ptap will take its toll on the bike). \u00a0Bring a light, as you might need it. \u00a0There are ton of acceptable lights under $20 on Amazon right now. \u00a0Just look for a T6 Cree LED Bike light, with minimially 1000 lumens. \u00a0Here is a link to one: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006Y1FK18\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">Cheap 1000 lumen bike light<\/a>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B006QQX3C4\/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=3FJIG6WZ09712&amp;coliid=I15GIMB04YOTYI\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><b>Weather:<\/b> Shine Only (there will undoubtedly be some mud, but no ride if it\u2019s raining or the trails are too muddy). Protect our trails and don\u2019t ride them when they\u2019re fragile. There may be days where I make a last minute call, so watch this page and our Facebook group on days where there is a chance of rain.<\/p> <p><b>Ride Organizer<\/b>(s): Craig P.<\/p> <p><br\/>Craig P, 443-8four5-threesix89; skibum616 at yahoo dot com<\/p>",

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:<\/p> <p><br\/>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun! More information can be found at &lt;a&gt;www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com.&lt;\/a&gt; Hope to see you there!<\/p>",

Our group welcomes anyone who is interested in talking about any aspect of the vegan or veg lifestyle, including health, food preparation, compassion for animals, spirituality, activism, ecology, and more.<\/p> <p>Our meetings have been fun, lively, and supportive. Mr. Chan has a wonderful selection of vegan menu options, probably the most of any Baltimore area restaurant. \u00a0Mr. Chan is located on 1000 Reisterstown Road, across the street from the Pikes Theater. There is often street parking available. And there is free parking behind the restaurant, and a public parking area adjacent to that lot.<\/p> <p>Meetup attendees get an opportunity each month to tell us a little about themselves: where they are from; what got them interested in the veg\/vegan lifestyle; their personal interests; success stories; or a chance to get some answers to questions with regard to diet and lifestyle.<\/p> <p>And please check out the monthly <b>Earthsave Veg Dinner Series<\/b> events that are normally held on the last Saturday from 6-8 pm at Towson Presbyterian Church, 400 Chesapeake Ave in Towson. The dinners are vegan and often attract a group of 40-70 attendees. \u00a0For more information, see <a href=\"http:\/\/earthsavebaltimore.org\/.\"><a href=\"http:\/\/earthsavebaltimore.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/earthsavebaltimore.org\/<\/a>.<\/a> Hope to see you there!<\/p> <p>You may also want to check out the <b>Baltimore Vegetarian Meetup<\/b> group, which is very similar to this one, but meets on the first Sunday, at 12.30 pm, at <b>Mango Grove<\/b> in Columbia.

The center is located at 424 Fourth Street in Annapolis.<\/p> <p>The sessions will be led by Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche. Born in Tibet in 1973, he is a monk, scholar, and author. The Dalai Lama and the Seventeenth Gyalwang Karmapa have glowingly endorsed his book \u201cThe Lamp of Reasoning and Scriptures of the Sage, the Buddha.\u201d He has received advanced Buddhist training from masters in India, Sikkim, and Nepal. Now a citizen of the United States, Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche makes his home in Annapolis, Maryland.<\/p> <p>One portion of the session will be dedicated to Lojong, a mind training practice in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition based on a set of fifty-nine slogans.<\/p> <p>The other part of the session is devoted to the practice of Chenrezig, the Buddha of Compassion. It is taught that the practice of Chenrezig helps people to cultivate genuine compassion for all sentient beings and ultimately leads us to the realization of enlightenment.\u00a0The meditation consists of chanting a liturgy and visualizing the form of Chenrezig. Although some aspects of the practice may seem foreign, attendees are encouraged to relax, delight in the ritual, and not become preoccupied with doing it \"right.\"<\/p> <p>People of all belief systems and current practitioners of all levels are welcome to attend. Visitors and members can attend on an \u201cas can\u201d basis, attending as much or as little as they are able. Attendees sit on floor cushions or chairs provided at the center<\/p> <p>The Gampopa Center was founded in 2009 by Tibetan born Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche based on the Buddhist understanding that the teachings of Buddha can bring people peace, happiness, and freedom. The center holds weekly study sessions, short courses, and special events at its Annapolis location.<\/p> <p>Ongoing Wednesday night attendees need not RSVP; we ask that first-time Wednesday night attendees RSVP because there is a limited amount of seating available. \u00a0<\/p> <p>In order to allow the Gampopa Center\u2019s activities to continue and flourish, people are encouraged to make a donation if they are so moved.<\/p> <p>Visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gampopacenter.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gampopacenter.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.gampopacenter.com\/<\/a><\/a> or for more information.<\/p>",

Although a $10 donation is suggested, donations are not required for attendance.<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Each class will include:<\/b> guided meditation, instruction, opportunities to practice, and time for discussion, questions and answers.<\/p> <p><b>When and where:<\/b> We meet every Wednesday from 7:30-9:00 p.m. at Centennial High School, 4300 Centennial Lane, Ellicott City, MD, 21042, room 406. Please arrive early to settle into your seats - we start right at 7:30 p.m. [Note: During Summer months, we are meeting at the Oakland Manor. We will return to Centennial High School on 9\/2.]<\/p> <p><b>We practice Insight Meditation<\/b>, a style of meditation that helps the mind attain deeper levels of calm concentration through sustained attention on the breath, then combines this with the crucial aspect of insight through contemplation of the mind and body and all of their changing and impermanent senses, emotions and thoughts. Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teacher:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a high school physics teacher who has been meditating for 25 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004. Stan is a mentor with the Insight Meditation Community of Washington (IMCW) and is a graduate of the Meditation Teacher Training Institute, a two-year certification program with senior Insight teachers Tara Brach, Jonathan Foust, Hugh Byrne, and Pat Coffey. He also teaches Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Stan also earned a Masters of Social Work in 1998.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Location: Oakland Manor Town Center (Sterret) Room.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>Park anywhere in the Oakland Manor Parking lot. Enter the main entrance of the building (up the stairs). The room is up one more flight to the right. <b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Suggestions:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p><br\/>3. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>4. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>5. The group is not recommended for those under age 13.<\/p> <p>Please feel free to contact Stan Eisenstein at [masked] if you have any questions.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>",

It is amazing the amount of knowledge that we share with each other and the body of knowledge that we have as a group. All of our meetings have been great (even when only a few show up).<\/p> <p>I do ask that you RSVP for our meeting, but... if you haven\u2019t RSVP'd and would still like to come to the meeting \u2013 please do. The RSVP helps the meeting by showing others that we do have a group and that there will be a meeting that night. If you RSVP\u2019d yes and can\u2019t make it, that\u2019s OK too (you can always change your RSVP at any time).<\/p> <p>I hope that you will consider attending (newbie or old-hand). Our group has been meeting for over 3 years now. We have over 150 total members and we\u2019ve maintained a 5 star rating for our meetings. I believe that you will enjoy yourself and we will enjoy your company too.<\/p> <p>As always, everyone is invited to our meetings (including your non-Rockhound guests). I have videos from Cash and Treasures shows that cover some great rockhounding locations and I will bring out some of my \"treasures\".<\/p> <p>I hope you can make it, we are very informal, don't forget to bring someting (rocks, fossils, yard rock, book, map, whatever) to discuss.<\/p> <p>Wayne Homens<\/p> <p>Founder,\u00a0<br\/>Central Maryland Rock and Mineral Exchange Meetup<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/rockhounds\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/rockhounds<\/a><\/p>",

No matter what else we do, the primary focus of life \u2013 thoughts, words and actions- should be on the growth of the heart in all its different realms.As we grow in the realms of the heart, we become able to see, feel and understand people around us. Therefore, our relationships with others become deeper and more harmonious. As the heart grows, so does the love, and so does our ability to experience lasting happiness in all areas of our lives.\u201d Mehrdad Mizani<\/p> <p>To see a sample of Mehrdad's talk, go to the following links:<a href=\"http:\/\/batgap.com\/mehrdad-mizani\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/batgap.com\/mehrdad-mizani\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/batgap.com\/mehrdad-mizani\/<\/a><\/a><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/thewayofheart\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/thewayofheart\" class=\"embedded\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/thewayofheart<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Below Mehrdad on Jordan Rich show....delightful<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.cbslocal.com\/?podcast_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.podtrac.com%2Fpts%2Fredirect.mp3%2Fnyc.podcast.play.it%2Fmedia%2Fd0%2Fd0%2Fd1%2Fd2%2FdI%2FdJ%2FdO%2F12IJO_4.MP3%3Fauthtok%3D5562056298000598828_6ScUksjm73lKMqzU4LwR363IfI&amp;podcast_name=Music+For+The+Soul&amp;podcast_artist=Jordan+Rich&amp;station_id=91&amp;tag=&amp;dcid=CBS.BOSTON\"><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.cbslocal.com\/?podcast_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.podtrac.com%2Fpts%2Fredirect.mp3%2Fnyc.podcast.play.it%2Fmedia%2Fd0%2Fd0%2Fd1%2Fd2%2FdI%2FdJ%2FdO%2F12IJO_4.MP3%3Fauthtok%3D5562056298000598828_6ScUksjm73lKMqzU4LwR363IfI&amp;podcast_name=Music+For+The+Soul&amp;podcast_artist=Jordan+Rich&amp;station_id=91&amp;tag=&amp;dcid=CBS.BOSTON\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/boston.cbslocal.com\/?podcast_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.podtrac.com%2Fpts%2Fredirect.mp3%2Fnyc.podcast.play.it%2Fmedia%2Fd0%2Fd0%2Fd1%2Fd2%2FdI%2FdJ%2FdO%2F12IJO_4.MP3%3Fauthtok%3D5562056298000598828_6ScUksjm73lKMqzU4LwR363IfI&amp;podcast_name=Music+For+The+Soul&amp;podcast_artist=Jordan+Rich&amp;station_id=91&amp;tag=&amp;dcid=CBS.BOSTON<\/a><\/a><\/p>",

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun! More information can be found at &lt;a&gt;www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com.&lt;\/a&gt; Hope to see you there!<\/p>",

We'll ryde up to the Amish Market at Shrewsbury, PA, which will include lunch at any of the food outlets around its perimeter. The route includes some roads we\u2019ve seen; some we haven\u2019t. Pre-Ryde Meeting at 8:45-ish; PBO time around 9-ish. Please note meetup point: Freedom Park area off of Raincliffe Road in Sykesville. On MD 32 coming from the south, turn right on Raincliffe (from the north turn left); move about 1\/2 mile to the first stop sign; make a right on Buttercup, then move down to where you see us mustering. Pete, Tim and I will be waving you in. Be sure to have full tanks. The ryde is 115 miles. Fuel up at Sykesville Shell, 889 Sandosky Road, just opposite Raincliffe on the west side of MD 32.

        "description": "<p>For over 15 years, <a href=\"http:\/\/big-books.org\">Books for International Goodwill<\/a> (B.I.G.) has successfully recycled used books for productive use by those who need books for schools and libraries to improve literacy in developing communities around the world. B.I.G. is a project begun by the Parole Rotary Club of Annapolis and is now an independent non-profit entity. It's motto is \"Spreading Literacy by Keeping Books Alive\".<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll be sorting books by age level,\u00a0 and will pack them for shipment to overseas locations.\u00a0 B.I.G. has shipped millions of books to Africa, Eastern Europe, and other areas of the world.<\/p> <p>If there's sufficient interest,\u00a0 we may go to lunch afterwards at a nearby restaurant.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nDirections and general info:<\/p> <p>\n\nDirections to the warehouse can be found at <a href=\"http:\/\/big-books.org\/map.php\"><a href=\"http:\/\/big-books.org\/map.php\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/big-books.org\/map.php<\/a><\/a>.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Most of us will be at the back of the warehouse, packing pallets of books for shipping.\u00a0 Ask for \"Mitch\" when you arrive.<\/p> <p>You'll want to wear some old clothes, since they might get a little dirty.\u00a0 You may also want to bring a pair of work gloves.<\/p> <p>PACKING GUIDELINES<\/p> <p><br\/>Note: You\u2019ll be handling cardboard, heavy textbooks, pallets and tape applicators. Bring gloves to save protect your hands! BIG does have a few pair of light cotton gloves if you forget.<\/p> <p>\n\nBooks have usually been sorted into categories (e.g. high school, middle school, elementary) by other volunteers.\u00a0 Signs will be on display for the various categories. \u00a0We generally pack one category per pallets.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Packing: Take a new box and tape the bottom securely (3 or 4 strips lengthwise). If there are several\/many of the same book, put them all in the same carton (two different ways to put books into box).<\/p> <p>THE BOX MUST BE COMPLETELY FULL, LEVEL WITH THE TOP OF THE BOX. If the box isn\u2019t full, it will collapse when other boxes are put on top of it, making loading difficult and stacking of pallets impossible.\u00a0 If necessary, use smaller paperbacks to completely fill a box.\u00a0 A box that is slightly overfilled is preferable to an under filled box.<\/p> <p>Label the Completed Carton. Write contents on all cartons. Don't abbreviate. And if there is primarily one subject in the carton, write that on the box as well. It helps a lot on the receiver\u2019s end in sorting.\u00a0 Apply at least one Yellow B.I.G. label on each box.<\/p> <p>Stacking boxes on the pallets. Three levels of boxes are stored on each pallet.\u00a0 Each level is comprised of eight boxes.\u00a0 <i>Boxes should be stacked in a bricklayer pattern to distribute the weight and prevent boxes from being crushed.<\/i><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Our August book is <b>A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail<\/b> by Bill Bryson.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nFor reasons even he didn't understand, Bill Bryson decided in 1996 to walk the 2,100-mile Appalachian trail. Winding from Georgia to Maine, this uninterrupted 'hiker's highway' sweeps through the heart of some of America's most beautiful and treacherous terrain. Accompanied by his infamous crony, Stephen Katz, Bryson risks snake bite and hantavirus to trudge up unforgiving mountains, plod through swollen rivers, and yearn for cream sodas and hot showers. This amusingly ill-conceived adventure brings Bryson to the height of his comic powers, but his acute eye also observes an astonishing landscape of silent forests, sparkling lakes, and other national treasures that are often ignored or endangered. Fresh, illuminating, and uproariously funny, <i>A Walk in the Woods<\/i> showcases Bill Bryson at his very best.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nThe <i>A Walk In The Woods<\/i> movie stars Robert Redford, Nick Nolte, Emma Thompson, Nick Offerman, and Mary Steenburgen. It opens on Labor Day Weekend. Let's read the book in August then see the movie in September.<\/p> <p>\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/1\/4\/600_439527668.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>Synopsis<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\"Not long after I moved with my family to a small town in New Hampshire, I happened upon a path that vanished into a wood on the edge of town.\"<\/p> <p>So begins Bill Bryson's hilarious book <i>A Walk in the Woods.<\/i> Following his return to America after twenty years in Britain, Bryson decided to reacquaint himself with his native country by walking the 2,100-mile Appalachian Trail, which stretches from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine. The AT, as it's affectionately known to thousands of hikers, offers an astonishing landscape of silent forests and sparkling lakes--and to a writer with the comic genius of Bill Bryson, it also provides endless opportunities to test his own powers of ineptitude, and to witness the majestic silliness of his fellow human beings.<\/p> <p>For a start, there's the gloriously out-of-shape Stephen Katz, a buddy from Iowa who accompanies the similarly unfit Bryson on the trail. Once Bryson and Katz settle into their stride, it's not long before they come across the fabulously annoying Mary Ellen, whose disappearance ruins a perfectly good slice of pie, a gang of Ralph Lauren-attired yuppies from whom Katz appropriates a key piece of equipment, and a security guard in Pennsylvania who, for no ascertainable reason, impounds Bryson's car. Mile by arduous mile these latter-day pioneers walk America, along the way surviving the threat of bear attacks, the loss of key provisions, and everything else this awe-inspiring country can throw at them.<\/p> <p>But <i>A Walk in the Woods<\/i> is more than just a laugh-out-loud hike. Bryson's acute eye is a wise witness to this fragile and beautiful trail, and as he tells its fascinating history, he makes a moving plea for the conservation of America's last great wilderness. An adventure, a comedy, a lament, and a celebration, <i>A Walk in the Woods<\/i> is destined to become a modern classic of travel literature.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/d\/6\/5\/600_439528005.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Book Availability at the Howard Count Public Library<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>A Walk in the Woods<\/b> is available for checkout at the Howard County Public Library.

One of the most interesting aspects of this book is the unlikely friendship between Bryson and Katz. What is the relationship based on? Consider, especially, the episode in Maine when Katz gets lost: somehow the friendship is altered. How does Bryson's attitude toward Katz change over the course of the book? How does Katz himself change? Or does he? What was Katz's motivation, anyway, to walk the AT?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n2. The book offers an excellent microscope through which to examine the meaning of friendship\u2014our own friendships. Do the two men remind you of friends who tested your patience, but who exhibited intense loyalty?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n3. In fiction a journey usually symbolizes a journey of self-discovery\u2014at the end the protagonist comes to learn something about him\/herself. Although A Walk isn't a novel, do either of the men come to greater self-awareness by the end of their journey?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n4. The tone of the book veers back and forth between humor and seriousness, even anger. In fact, the book is a sort of jeremiad against environmental threats to the great wilderness areas of the country. Is Bryson's anger justified? He criticizes, but does he offer solutions? Are there solutions?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n5. Katz pokes fun at rural Southerners, which some readers find funny, others find offensive. You?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n6. Bryson ponders the attraction of hiking: ''You have no engagements, commitments, obligations, or duties; no special ambitions and only the smallest, least complicated of wants; you exist in a tranquil tedium, serenely beyond the reach of exasperation.\" If you're a hiker, backpacker, camper, are your experiences similar to or different from Bryson's? For those who aren't hikers, are there other avenues to \"exist in a tranquil tedium\"?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n7. You might also talk about the numerous characters Bryson and Katz meet on the trail. Mary Ellen is one, for instance: how do you feel about their treatment of her?<\/p>",

Maybe get a few more miles in there if we are feeling good. At least half of it is down hill (ha-ha!).<br\/>Duration: Approx. 4-5 hours, depending on group dynamics, trail conditions, wait-ups, mechanicals and\/or number of breaks (we will take at least one 10\u201315 min. break to refill if needed).

Since I couldn't get hold either one of those 2 and get them to call Bart tonight because he is spending the night on his boat and not near his computer to see who else might be jumping on his boat tomorrow.\u00a0 He lives in York PA.

        "description": "<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/b\/e\/600_436655774.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Annapolis is framed by Eastport on one side and the Severn River on the other.\u00a0Our SHR group often paddles around Eastport on Spa Creek and Back Creek. This time we'll explore the Severn River side of Annapolis that includes College Creek, Weems Creek, and two major highway bridges that cross the river.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>After our paddle, we can relax with refreshments and food at the Rams Head Roadhouse just a few miles away.<\/p> <p><b>Driving Directions<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll meet up and launch our kayaks at Jonas Green Park located by the Rt 450 bridge that crosses the Severn River to Annapolis. You can see the park down below as you approach the bridge on Rt 450 from Rt 50 East. To get there, you'll need to turn left at the traffic light before the bridge onto Baltimore Annapolis Blvd.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/b\/8\/600_436655768.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The Google Meetup map above shows the address for the Severn Inn which is the best way to find our meetup spot. After turning left from Rt 450 onto Baltimore Annapolis Blvd at the light, take the first right turn that leads down to the Severn Inn and Jonas Green Park.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The Jonas Green parking lot is straight ahead as you go under the bridge.\u00a0If the parking lot is full, check out the Severn Inn lot next door.\u00a0We'll launch our boats from the designated kayak beach by the parking lot. There are restrooms and porta-potties at the park.<\/p> <p><b>Paddling Along the Severn River<\/b><\/p> <p>Our kayaking route from Jonas Green Park will be a relaxed pace crossing the Severn River under the Rt 450 bridge to College Creek, a charming tributary that runs past St. John's College and the U.S. Naval Academy. Then we'll return to the Severn River and paddle a short distance to explore scenic Weems Creek, a side of Annapolis most people never see.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/e\/f\/600_436655823.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/c\/0\/9\/600_436655849.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>After exploring Weems Creek, our group will cross back to the eastern side of the Severn River protected by the pilings of the Rt. 50 bridge. Once there, it's a straight paddle along the shore of the Severn River back to our starting point at Jonas Green Park.<\/p> <p><br\/>Total roundtrip distance for this paddle will be 7-8 miles. Bring a wide-brim hat, sunscreen, and cold water to stay hydrated.<\/p> <p><b>Skill Level<\/b><\/p> <p>This event is suitable for anyone who has good paddling skills. You must be able to\u00a0paddle confidently while staying together with our group of kayakers for approximately three hours on the water.<\/p> <p>College Creek and Weems Creek are generally calm, while the swells and waves on the larger Severn River are not normally too difficult. However, the Severn River can get choppy due to wind and the wakes of passing boats, so you must be prepared to handle some sizable waves and turbulent water.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/c\/1\/0\/600_436655856.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><i>ALL PARTICIPANTS MUST WEAR A PFD AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL SAFETY<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Our group of recreational kayakers look out for each other, but we're not certified experts at rescuing novices. Our paddle events have been very successful because we stick together in case anyone needs assistance. Let's keep it that way!<\/p> <p><b>Kayak Rentals<\/b><\/p> <p>Kayak rentals at Jonas Green Park are available from\u00a0Paddle or Pedal, the park's boat rental concessionaire, which has a limited number of kayaks that are mostly tandems. They\u00a0charge $15 per hour for a single kayak and $20 per hour for a tandem kayak. An all-day kayak rental is $45, which is a good choice since we'll be on the water three hours or more. Call them at[masked] to find out what's available. Full details are available on the website:\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.paddleorpedal.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.paddleorpedal.com<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Post-Paddle at the Rams Head Roadhouse<\/b><\/p> <p>After the paddle, we'll pack up our boats at Jonas Green Park and drive six miles to the Rams Head Roadhouse at 1773 General's Highway. It's a relaxed and fun place with good food and drinks that our SHR group enjoys. Full details with directions, reviews, and a map below:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/rams-head-roadhouse-annapolis\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/rams-head-roadhouse-annapolis<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/d\/c\/600_436655804.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Weather Considerations<\/b><\/p> <p>This event depends upon good kayaking weather. I'll post a notice here and send out an email by 9:00 am if we need to change plans or cancel. A little rain won't stop us and can add to the adventure, but we won't paddle in excessive heat, high winds, or other dangerous conditions.<\/p> <p>Call Jake at[masked] with any questions.<\/p> <p>I hope to see you there!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/d\/5\/600_436655797.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

Because of the low turnout I lost $60+ so to offset it slightly, it'll be $6 until further notice.<\/p> <p>2. To encourage no-shows to come and negate their impact when they don't I have discussed with other members and decided that reservations will be fully confirmed by paypal payments and slots can be taken by those who reserve and pay from the waiting list(of course this will require checking with me to see if all who reserved have payed yet.) I will postpone this change for now, in hopes that maybe, just maybe it won't really be necessary.<\/p> <p>3. In honor of the original founder, who I can only hope to be as gracious of a host as he was, we are all about fun, so no other changes.\u00a0<\/p>",

Some folks just need a 15 min refresher and others want to just hang out at the pool. We recommend you bring a chair and what ever else you need to spend the afternoon at the pool. There is a 3 story spiral water slide at this pool(FYI)!

If your joining for dinner you need to be at Paper Moon by 5:15pm so they can have a guest count. They do not seat until everyone in the party is there.

        "description": "<p>There are few musical genres more American than bluegrass. Although it has its roots in Irish and Scottish music based on the number of early refugees from these countries that settled in the Appalachians, the form it takes today is purely American. The folks who first sang bluegrass (or mountain music, as it was known then) were fairly isolated from the rest of the country, so they sang about their own communities, the hard life in the Appalachians, and the beautiful country that surrounded them, feeling blessed to live there.<\/p> <p>The Annapolis Bluegrass Coalition is a premier bluegrass band from Annapolis. A love of bluegrass music is deeply ingrained in the hearts and souls of these five world class musicians and they have been winning the hearts of bluegrass fans from all who have heard them play. Using the tools of their trade, banjo, fiddle, mandolin, guitar and bass fiddle, the Annapolis Bluegrass Coalition offers traditional and contemporary compositions laced with three part harmonies and bluesy solos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Indeed, soul is the very essence of Annapolis Bluegrass Coalition and best describes how they play. It is evident during their performances. Rarely do you see artists that enjoy what they do as much as the Annapolis Bluegrass Coalition. Their warmth and interaction with the audience makes you feel as if they are playing just for you, and that's just what they are doing. \u00a0Listen to them perform \"Blue Moon of Kentucky:\"<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?t=62&amp;v=txCAjfJMDCc\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?t=62&amp;v=txCAjfJMDCc<\/a><\/p>",

It is a big ride for a non-paying event (&gt;60 people), but riders are fairly spread out. \u00a0<\/p> <p>The routes have some fairly tough climbs and there is traffic, so should be comfortable riding hills and in traffic. \u00a0Road bike recommended. \u00a0Helmets are required. \u00a0No helmet, no ride. \u00a0The bike shop also requires riders to sign a disclaimer for the first ride. \u00a0<\/p> <p>We will meet in the upper parking lot. \u00a0Everyone who comes can pick their pace level. \u00a0\u00a0<b>The ride leaves promptly at 9, so we cannot wait for late-comers. \u00a0<\/b>I posted the ride for 8:45 to account for this, but try to come 8:30 to sign the disclaimer and for bike check.<\/p> <p>Here's the link to the bike shop events page:\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.localendar.com\/event?DAM=PublishedEvent&amp;m=479736&amp;event_id=77&amp;calendar_id=479736&amp;more_info=N&amp;export_date=Aug%2030,%202015&amp;category=10\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.localendar.com\/event?DAM=PublishedEvent&amp;m=479736&amp;event_id=77&amp;calendar_id=479736&amp;more_info=N&amp;export_date=Aug%2030,%202015&amp;category=10\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.localendar.com\/event?DAM=PublishedEvent&amp;m=479736&amp;event_id=77&amp;calendar_id=479736&amp;more_info=N&amp;export_date=Aug%2030,%202015&amp;category=10<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Hope to see you there! \u00a0In case you can't make this ride, \u00a0they ride through October, so will post additional rides as we get closer to later dates.<\/p>",

After about a half hour of collecting we will regroup and caravan over to a local residence for a power point presentation on wild mushroom hunting, ethics, taxonomy, mycomedicinals, field guide interpretation and other wondrous facts about the 5th kingdom. Next we will apply our new knowledge by working with Michael to identify all the mushrooms we collected.<\/p> <p>You\u2019ll need to bring drinking water, a knife, small trowel, small-medium paper bags and be able to keep time so you don\u2019t wander too far.<\/p> <p>If you are serious about pursuing mushroom knowledge you should have and bring a field ID guide, at the very least. The three that I carry if weight is not an issue are National Audubon Society Field Guide to Mushrooms, Simon &amp; Schuster\u2019s Guide to Mushrooms and the Peterson Field Guide to Mushrooms. They are listed in my preferred order, first being my favorite.<\/p> <p>Mushroom cultivating supplies will be for sale by Michael but is in limited supply. If you have specific requests email him at least one month prior to the workshop, follow the web link above for contact info.<\/p> <p>We will be doing a mushroom cultivation workshop later this year. That workshop will be hands on and full of tricky ways to use already available material to cultivate mushrooms as well as how to extend a kit you already have or start from a mushroom you found or purchased.<\/p> <p><b>**For full workshop details and to register visit: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.charmcityfarms.org\/mushroom-identification-101-2\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.charmcityfarms.org\/mushroom-identification-101-2\/<\/a> **<\/b><\/p>",

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\". That way, we know not to be waiting for you. Thanks.<\/b><\/p> <p>So come join us on Sunday for a brisk walk in the park. It's a great way to clean out the cobwebs and start a Sunday.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>This packed dirt trail is one of the Most Scenic bike paths in the Baltimore\/Washington area. Suitable for all bike except the narrowest road tires (less than 25 mm in width). And for added enticement, after a great lunch at Seven Sports Bar and Grill we will stop by Bonkey's Ice Cream. Come join us for an enjoyable ride on what looks to be a sunny 80s temperature day.<\/p> <p>Monkton Rd parking GPS coordinates:[masked], [masked]<\/p> <p>(at intersection of Monkton Rd and Old Monkton Rd, in Monkton Maryland)<\/p> <p>The address for Monkton Station is 1820 Monkton Road, Monkton, MD 21111<\/p> <p>Directions to full distance ride:<\/p> <p>Exit 27 off Route 83 Mt. Carmel Rd East 0.5 miles to Route 45 York Rd South (right turn at light) 100yds then left turn at light onto Monkton Rd (Rt 138 East) for 2.8 miles to parking along Monkton Rd shown on map below. Then ride your bike to historic Monkton Station 0.2 miles East across the Gunpowder River bridge.<\/p> <p>We will leave promptly at 10:15AM from Monkton so arrive with plenty of time to be ready to roll.<\/p> <p>Please do not wait until the morning of the bike ride to check whether there is enough air in your tires, or whether everything is in working order. Check your bike the night before so you will have an opportunity to fix any problems before the ride.<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________<\/p> <p>For those that may not be ready for a 28 mile bike ride, I am suggesting an alternate spot to start and end the trip in White Hall, Maryland (parking lot next to trail at the intersection of Wiseburg Rd and White Hall Rd in White Hall, MD). This shortens the trip to 20 miles total and a 10:30 AM start time to meetup with the group leaving Monkton at 10:15 AM.<\/p> <p>Directions to shorter ride:<\/p> <p>White Hall parking GPS coordinates:[masked], [masked]<\/p> <p>Exit 27 off Route 83 Mt. Carmel Rd East 0.5 miles to Route 45 York Rd North (left turn at light) 2.4 miles to Wiseburg Rd East (right turn) 1.7 miles to White Hall, parking lot on right. (Note: You will come to a Tee intersection on Wiseburg Rd at 1.4 miles, Wiseburg Rd continues to the right for 0.3 miles to the town of White Hall)<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________<\/p> <p><br\/>Bike Ride on the Northern Central Railroad Trail<\/p> <p><br\/>A 28 Mile Round Trip with Lunch at the Halfway Point<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/7\/0\/600_441028272.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/6\/6\/600_441028262.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/5\/2\/600_441028242.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Bike rentals available next to the trail at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikestuff.net\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bikestuff.net\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Please make your own arrangements with the bike shop.<\/p> <p><br\/>We\u2019ll start our bike ride in Monkton Maryland, a real mecca for cyclists in the springtime. The NCR trail is, in my opinion, the most scenic rural bike path in the greater Washington\/Baltimore area. Its total length is about 40 miles following a former railroad bed that starts near the Baltimore beltway and runs north to York Pennsylvania. The surface is hard-packed crushed stone surface and is suitable for hybrid and other relatively wide tire bicycles. Narrow road bike tires (less than 1 inch wide) can make the journey but are more susceptible to punctures.<\/p> <p><br\/>We will travel north 14 miles to the town of New Freedom, PA at a 10-12 mph pace. There we will have lunch at a local sports bar called \u201cSeven\u201d, then return 14 miles back to Monkton. The Gunpowder River follows the route for a good portion of our trip. Being part of Gunpowder Falls State Park, the ride is full of nature with woods, farmhouses and fields.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/9\/2\/600_441028306.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This is the Monkton Station where we\u2019ll meet. The parking lot is small so if no spaces are available, park along the road where it\u2019s allowed (about 400 yards from the station across the Gunpowder river from the station \u2013 map below)<\/p> <p><br\/>Legal parking locations along Monkton Road near Monkton Station:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/a\/b\/600_441028331.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This is basically an all day event starting at 10:00 AM and ending around 4:00 PM.<br\/>Things to bring: bike, bike lock, helmet, water and money for lunch.<\/p> <p>Ride Meetup Time: 10:00 AM<br\/>Ride Start Time: 10:15 AM<\/p> <p><br\/>Let's have a fun time and if you need to contact me the day of the ride, call my cell number listed below.<\/p> <p>Tom LeFevere[masked]<\/p>",

The promenade is a newly-developed area of beautiful walkways, marinas, apartments, and docks that runs all the way to Inner Harbor. It's a popular destination for walking,\u00a0jogging, and showing off dogs.\u00a0There are excellent views of Baltimore harbor's ships and yachting marinas the whole way, along with benches and scenic viewpoints to enjoy the waterfront ambience.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>This is an easy sight-seeing walk with many places to stop or rest. Total distance will be approximately four miles. Our initial destination will be Fells Point and its many cool shops and pubs on Thames St. We'll then continue along the Promenade past the Pier Six Pavilion, the Baltimore Aquarium, and the Inner Harbor until we arrive at the newly-restored USS Constellation tall ship.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/6\/4\/600_412937252.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/e\/9\/1\/600_435436017.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/6\/a\/4\/600_412950372.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Return Trip by Water Taxi<\/b><\/p> <p>When we're ready to return, we can catch the Baltimore Water Taxi from Inner Harbor back to Canton Waterfront Park\u00a0where we parked our cars.

Yet\u00a0 the very technology designed for our well-being often serves only to isolate us from one another and distance us from the experience of all that is truly divine.<\/p> <p><br\/>The Bhakti Lounge is a place where incredible transformation and healing takes place all through the culture of bhakti. Meditation, Kirtan, Discussions on the Bhagavad Gita and other ancient texts from the Vedic tradition , Vegetarian food prepared using Bhakti &amp; Ayurvedic principles create an environment where lifelong friendships are made. As one yogi remarked\" I finally found a\u00a0 community of kindred spirits\"<\/p> <p><br\/>We meet every Sunday on 200 Bloomsbury Avenue Catonsville, MD from 6 pm to 8 pm. Please join us to create a sacred circle of love and devotion and bring bliss\/ananda in the Baltimore region and beyond.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nHope to see you soon!<\/p>",

Guided relaxation, gentle stretching, and meditation provide a peaceful 'pause' during this busy time.<\/p> <p>It's $20 to drop in for one class, or you can sign up for less than the full session by paying $18 x the number of classes.<\/p> <p>For more information, call the studio at 410.720.4340.

On some days, you will hike, crawl, lunge, and have a fun time while burning a ton of fat and meeting new people. It's always an adventure!

The Scenarios for Adventure 1 and Adventure 3 are also available at the store and can be run by anyone with a copy of the core card game and the relevant Adventure Deck numbers. If you can bring a core game please list that with your RSVP so we can expand the number of player seats.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Adventure 0-2 - A Pirate's Life<\/b><\/p> <p>Yo ho! A pirate\u2019s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\u2019s more to a pirate\u2019s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\u2019s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate\u2019s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\u2019s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.<\/p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that\u2019s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there\u2019s power, there\u2019s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play, as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we are sure we have space for, but if there is more interest, we can almost certainly make more room. So please sign up for the wait list if you want to play.<\/p> <p>3.

The evening will consist of being guided into a meditative state, where you will then be \"turned loose\" to gain insight, reflect, realign your spirit, receive guidance or simply be in the moment. This meditation time will last approximately 30 minutes, after which you will be gently brought back to the here and now. Following meditation there will be social time to share your experience (if you wish), visit with others and partake of light refreshments. There is no charge for this gathering but donations are greatly appreciated to offset refreshment costs.<\/p>",

If you've never played before, the game goes something like this, according to Wikipedia:<\/p> <p>The team chooses one person to begin drawing; this position rotates with each word. The drawer chooses a card out of a deck of special Pictionary cards and tries to draw pictures which suggest the word printed on the card. The pictures cannot contain any numbers or letters, nor can the drawer use verbal clues about the subject he\/she is drawing. The teammates try to guess the word the drawing is intended to represent.<\/p> <p>Don't forget your $1 for meetup.com costs.

Yes, for years, even though our permit was until 10:30 PM, we sometimes played until 11, 11:30 and sometimes even past midnight. Until-a new, nasty custodian turned us in to the Vice Principal, who sent an e-mail to the Rec council who forwarded it to us. We then had to be out of the gym 10:30 PM sharp, NO EXCEPTIONS. After that, when we put in for a new permit, we requested that the time be extended until 11Pm, which was approved.\u00a0<\/p> <p>WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW ANYTHING THAT COULD POSSIBLY AFFECT OUR 35+ YEARS CONTINUOUS PERMIT AT THE OM HIGH SCHOOL.<\/p>",

We guarantee 6 playing partners at your playing level, but have been averaging closer to 15+ partners in most cities.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Your Task - \"Flexible Scheduling\"<\/b><\/p> <p>After this kickoff email is sent, it is the player's task to communicate with other players. Players should work with their partners to find an agreeable time and location to play the match. While Tennis-Baltimore doesn't mandate your playing schedule, it is recommended that players schedule at least one match per week. By request of the players, we started to allow players to play 1 rematch per season. The regular season is all about playing as much as you can.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>",

I suggest bringing a yoga mat for floor exercises, but if you don't have one..don't worry we'll improvise!<\/p> <p>What are classes like?<br\/>Classes are taught to beginner's level, with variations for more advanced students. All movements and combinations are broken down to their basic components and explained. The first half of class focuses on basic technique and isolations to prepare the body for the specific movements that are part of the choreography work on in the end. The end of class is where we work on a choreographed piece. Expect to dance the entire time, work up a good sweat, get a good workout, and learn a little something new almost every class.<\/p> <p>Will this class help me tone up?<br\/>It sure will! Part of what we work on during the first half of class is component devoted solely to our abs, legs, booties, backs and arms so be prepared to work it out ladies!!<\/p>",

FUN!<\/p> <p>However, since each workout program is intentionally different to alleviate boredom and to give you maximum results in minimum time its difficult to describe a \"typical day.\" You can expect some light running, resistance training, obstacle courses, core, body weight, and team training. On some days, you will hike, crawl, lunge, and have a fun time while burning a ton of fat and meeting new people. It's always an adventure! These 1 hour workouts are design to provide a total body workout, in half the time!<\/p> <p>Can wait to see you at the next session!<\/p>",

Washington Conference Center campus (up the hill), and it is a totally amazing building. Check it out:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/charlesbrickbauer.com\/images\/usfg1.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>To get to the venue, use the Smith street entrance (and not the entrance that weaves its way through the Mt. Washington Conference Center). See below map for detail.<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?hl=en&amp;georestrict=input_srcid:e01105162751571c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;view=map&amp;cid=17763643535889233356&amp;q=DLA+Piper+LLP+%28US%29&amp;ved=0CBgQpQY&amp;ei=wePyS5iQCYSKsQO8xaGyBg&amp;hq=DLA+Piper+LLP&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=39.379625,-76.654315&amp;spn=0.01161,0.018239&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A&amp;source=embed\">View Larger Map<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/i.imm.io\/r6F0.png\" \/> <b>Parking &amp; Transportation<\/b><br\/>Parking is plentiful and there's a lot right next to the building, with plenty of room for all attendees. And it's free. What can be better? One favor, tho -- leave the few visitor spots that are right in front of the building available for the use of the offices. They have some elderly clients who aren't able to walk up the walkway to the building. The lot is really big and very close so you shouldn't need those spots anyways.<\/p> <p>Public Transportation<\/p> <p>The Mt. Washington campus is located very conveniently near the Light Rail stop, which is literally just down the hill from the venue. Get off at the Mt. Washington Light Rail station, and then climb the steps to the Octagon Building at Mt. Washington and from there you can get to the DLA Piper building. It's a 15-20 minute walk at most.<\/p> <p>There are also shuttles from the JHU Homewood and JHMI campuses right to the Mt. Washington Conference center, including one that leaves at 7:40AM from Homewood getting in by 8AM, and leaving at 9:35AM to return to Homewood. Very convenient.<\/p> <p><b>Consent to Recording and Photography<\/b> By attending this event, you consent to having yourself and\/or your presentation video recorded and\/or photographed by the TechBreakfast organizers and\/or anyone else attending.

It's a good place for us to gather and hang out.\u00a0We'll start by enjoying happy hour and take it from there.\u00a0I'll be at the Chart House starting around 5:00 pm.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The Chart House bar area is open seating, so look for us or find a good spot where you can see the sailboats through the huge windows facing Spa Creek. Afterward, we can take a pleasant stroll around Eastport to see the boats from the docks or Horn Point Park at the end of Chesapeake Ave. Walking around Eastport is always a good time. People usually gather at\u00a0the Boatyard Bar &amp; Grill following the race to mingle and watch instant videos of the racing.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/3\/a\/d\/600_434889133.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/f\/b\/a\/600_437680890.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Details about the Wednesday Night Races are available on the Annapolis Yacht Club website:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.annapolisyc.com\/racing\/wnr\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.annapolisyc.com\/racing\/wnr\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.annapolisyc.com\/racing\/wnr<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>I hope to see you there!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/3\/e\/d\/600_434889197.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

Wheels rolling by 6:00. We will not wait past 6:00. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Pace:<\/b> Pace will be Intermediate, approx. 6.5 to 7 mph. Appropriate for average to riders, but not for beginners, or people who are not riding at least once a week. \u00a0Attitude is laid-back and friendly, but please ensure you can handle the pace and length of this ride before committing. This is a no-drop ride, i.e., we wait up for everyone at intersections. (Note: if you don\u2019t want to wait up for slower riders, this is NOT the ride for you, but please also survey your current fitness, as no one likes to be the one person holding up a larger group). \u00a0Please also note Ptap rides tend to be about 1 mph slower than Rosy, or Fairland, due terrain. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Terrain:<\/b> Ranges from Easy to Difficult. Most trails are in great shape, but plan on some mud spots. There are a few very steep climbs, rocks and technical sections, log overs (up to 10\" logs, and 3' stacks), tight single track (12\" wide in spots), and a stream crossing or two. \u00a0A strong\/advanced rider will be able to clean most sections, others will need to get off of their bikes in spots. \u00a0This is a friendly ride, so we will wait up for everyone, just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places. \u00a0This is a video edit I made from last fall through winter. \u00a0We won't hit all of this terrain, but gives you a feel for Patapsco:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Distance:<\/b>\u00a0With days getting longer we will be minimally getting 10 miles, and if conditions and light allow, we will push towards 20. \u00a0Exact route will change depending on group dynamics, trail conditions, daylight, etc. \u00a0I will typically have route planned in my head at the beginning of the ride, but will modify as needed to get us back at a reasonable time. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Duration:<\/b> I shoot to have us back before it gets dark (so 2 to 3 hours as the days get longer). \u00a0This can change with mechanical issues, and group dynamics though. \u00a0As this is a weekday ride, the stops will be just long enough for the last rider to catch their breath. \u00a0Note: wheels roll at stated time, so please don\u2019t be late.<\/p> <p><b>Bring:<\/b> Helmet (required), water (as much as you can carry), spare tube\/patch kit, pump\/CO2, multi-tool, I.D., emergency contact info where it can be easily located on your person, and a good attitude, as this ride is as much about camaraderie as it is about riding. Take a look at your bike and make sure it is in good working condition (Ptap will take its toll on the bike). \u00a0Bring a light, as you might need it. \u00a0There are ton of acceptable lights under $20 on Amazon right now. \u00a0Just look for a T6 Cree LED Bike light, with minimially 1000 lumens. \u00a0Here is a link to one: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006Y1FK18\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">Cheap 1000 lumen bike light<\/a>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B006QQX3C4\/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=3FJIG6WZ09712&amp;coliid=I15GIMB04YOTYI\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><b>Weather:<\/b> Shine Only (there will undoubtedly be some mud, but no ride if it\u2019s raining or the trails are too muddy).

The weather looks great for tomorrow and the Sailing Club I belong to (CSA) will be have a HH\/Dinner there tomorrow evening. We expect a large turn-out. I can't post this as a meetup for everyone (Just 1 meetup group) but I can e-mail everyone and invite everyone to come. You do not have to join the CSA Meetup Group to come. +Bart Hass+ is the BYC member who is graciously making arrange with me to make this happen. It will be the last time this year that we can have a dinner here, since they will be closing up for the season. Maybe next year we can be out here the first of the season to start the sailing season off right. I do mid week so that our crowd doesn't mess up plans for the BYC* members. (See the below link to check out the announcement and location on the CSA Meetup site). normBYC*- Baltimore Yacht Club sits on a hill out on a peninsula(A large section of land with water all around it) See the Map and pictures on the site(BELOW) where we had 90 some people here 2 years ago with the same conditions like it will be tomorrow night. +BART HASS+ &amp; CSA is password to get into the place which has a phone near the gate that will let you in when you pick it up and say you are hear for CSA or friend of Bart Hass so that the gate slides open. Then you can park to your left and walk down to the hill on the left side to go up the steps to the club house where dinner will be served. Dinner will also be outside as long as they have enough seating set up for everyone (first come first served). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/csa-com\/events\/224767303\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/csa-com\/events\/224767303\/<\/a><\/p>",

Get there early.\u00a0 I plan to get there by 6:00.\u00a0 If you want to be sure you can sit with the group, I suggest getting there before 6:30.\u00a0 If you arrive and there's no space to sit with us, there's nothing I can do about that.<\/p> <p>2. Use the restroom before you arrive.<\/p> <p>3. Bring a camp chair and picnic supplies including food and drink.\u00a0 Sharing is optional.\u00a0 I would guess alcohol is technically not allowed on the public pier, but you will see plenty of it and no one seems to care.\u00a0 I suggest being as discrete as possible though, for example, if you bring wine, keep the bottle in a paper bag, pour it into plastic cups, and keep it down low when pouring.<\/p> <p>4. Be prepared to enjoy the evening.\u00a0 The show doesn't start until 7:30 pm, so we'll have a lot of time to sit and picnic.<\/p> <p>5. The long term weather forecast is upper 80's.\u00a0 I plan to bring an umbrella just in case, although at the moment, it doesn't look like rain.<\/p> <p>6. The parking garage at the corner of Fleet St and Eden St (6 blocks away) is $3 after 5 pm.\u00a0 If you're earlier than that, the Little Italy parking garage at the corner of S Central Ave and Bank St (7 blocks away) is $4 after 4 pm.<\/p> <p>7. I'll email my cell # to everyone Wednesday morning.\u00a0 Call if you have trouble finding us.\u00a0 Note however I'll only be taking calls until 7:30 pm--after that, I plan to turn my phone off so I can enjoy the picnic and concert.<\/p> <p>8. If you have any questions, please post them below in the comments.<\/p> <p>See everyone on Wednesday!<\/p>",

Between mouthfuls of food and over the delicate scraping of cutlery, the conversation remains a gentle hum of politeness - the banality of work, the triviality of holidays. But the empty words hide a terrible conflict and, with every forced smile and every new course, the knives are being sharpened... Each couple has a fifteen-year-old son. Together, the boys have committed a horrifying act, caught on camera, and their grainy images have been beamed into living rooms across the nation; despite a police manhunt, the boys remain unidentified - by everyone except their parents. As the dinner reaches its culinary climax, the conversation finally touches on their children and, as civility and friendship disintegrate, each couple shows just how far they are prepared to go to protect those they love.<\/p> <p>Review courtesy of Goodreads:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/15797938-the-dinner?from_search=true&amp;search_version=legacy\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/15797938-the-dinner?from_search=true&amp;search_version=legacy<\/a><\/p> <p>Please ask the hostess to seat you with the Howard County Library's book club as there are two clubs meeting at the same time.<\/p>",

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:<\/p> <p><br\/>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun! More information can be found at &lt;a&gt;www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com.&lt;\/a&gt; Hope to see you there!<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Abolish an ancient evil threatening devastation in this adventure for the world\u2019s greatest roleplaying game!<\/p> <p>Called by the Elder Elemental Eye to serve, four corrupt prophets have risen from the depths of anonymity to claim mighty weapons with direct links to the power of the elemental princes. Each of these prophets has assembled a cadre of cultists and creatures to serve them in the construction of four elemental temples of lethal design. It is up to adventurers from heroic factions such as the Emerald Enclave and the Order of the Gauntlet to discover where the true power of each prophet lay, and dismantle it before it comes boiling up to obliterate the Realms.<\/p> <p>Dungeon and Dragons Encounters run every Wednesday from 7pm - 9pm at the Collector's Corner Outpost in Bel Air Maryland. Grab your dice and your level 1-4 Adventure League character (or use a pre-gen) and join the adventure.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>\"The Ghost Map : The Story of London's Most Terrifying Epidemic : and How It Changed Science, Cities, and the Modern World\", Steven Johnson (2005)<\/p> <p>The Ghost Map takes place in the summer of 1854. A devastating cholera outbreak seizes London just as it is emerging as a modern city: more than 2 million people packed into a ten-mile circumference, a hub of travel and commerce, teeming with people from all over the world, continually pushing the limits of infrastructure that's outdated as soon as it's updated. Dr. John Snow\u2014whose ideas about contagion had been dismissed by the scientific community\u2014is spurred to intense action when the people in his neighborhood begin dying.<br\/>With enthralling suspense, Johnson chronicles Snow's day-by-day efforts, as he risks his own life to prove how the epidemic is being spread.<\/p> <p>When he creates the map that traces the pattern of outbreak back to its source, Dr. Snow didn't just solve the most pressing medical riddle of his time. He ultimately established a precedent for the way modern city-dwellers, city planners, physicians, and public officials think about the spread of disease and the development of the modern urban environment. The Ghost Map is an endlessly compelling and utterly gripping account of that London summer of 1854.<\/p>",

Although a $10 donation is suggested, donations are not required for attendance.<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Each class will include:<\/b> guided meditation, instruction, opportunities to practice, and time for discussion, questions and answers.<\/p> <p><b>When and where:<\/b> We meet every Wednesday from 7:30-9:00 p.m. at Centennial High School, 4300 Centennial Lane, Ellicott City, MD, 21042, room 406. Please arrive early to settle into your seats - we start right at 7:30 p.m. [Note: During Summer months, we are meeting at the Oakland Manor. We will return to Centennial High School on 9\/2.]<\/p> <p><b>We practice Insight Meditation<\/b>, a style of meditation that helps the mind attain deeper levels of calm concentration through sustained attention on the breath, then combines this with the crucial aspect of insight through contemplation of the mind and body and all of their changing and impermanent senses, emotions and thoughts. Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teacher:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a high school physics teacher who has been meditating for 25 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004. Stan is a mentor with the Insight Meditation Community of Washington (IMCW) and is a graduate of the Meditation Teacher Training Institute, a two-year certification program with senior Insight teachers Tara Brach, Jonathan Foust, Hugh Byrne, and Pat Coffey. He also teaches Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Stan also earned a Masters of Social Work in 1998.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Location: Oakland Manor Town Center (TC) Room.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>Park anywhere in the Oakland Manor Parking lot.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p><br\/>3. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>4. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>5. The group is not recommended for those under age 13.<\/p> <p>Please feel free to contact Stan Eisenstein at [masked] if you have any questions.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Our August book is <b>A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail<\/b> by Bill Bryson.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nFor reasons even he didn't understand, Bill Bryson decided in 1996 to walk the 2,100-mile Appalachian trail. Winding from Georgia to Maine, this uninterrupted 'hiker's highway' sweeps through the heart of some of America's most beautiful and treacherous terrain. Accompanied by his infamous crony, Stephen Katz, Bryson risks snake bite and hantavirus to trudge up unforgiving mountains, plod through swollen rivers, and yearn for cream sodas and hot showers. This amusingly ill-conceived adventure brings Bryson to the height of his comic powers, but his acute eye also observes an astonishing landscape of silent forests, sparkling lakes, and other national treasures that are often ignored or endangered. Fresh, illuminating, and uproariously funny, <i>A Walk in the Woods<\/i> showcases Bill Bryson at his very best.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nThe <i>A Walk In The Woods<\/i> movie stars Robert Redford, Nick Nolte, Emma Thompson, Nick Offerman, and Mary Steenburgen. It opens on Labor Day Weekend. Let's read the book in August then see the movie in September.<\/p> <p>\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/1\/4\/600_439527668.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Since our discussion is held at the Nordstrom Market Cafe, I plan on enjoying dinner during our discussion. Eating or drinking is optional but I certainly plan on enjoying something to eat and drink during our discussion. The Nordstrom Market Cafe is located on the second floor of Norstroms in the Columbia Mall.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Synopsis<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\"Not long after I moved with my family to a small town in New Hampshire, I happened upon a path that vanished into a wood on the edge of town.\"<\/p> <p>So begins Bill Bryson's hilarious book <i>A Walk in the Woods.<\/i> Following his return to America after twenty years in Britain, Bryson decided to reacquaint himself with his native country by walking the 2,100-mile Appalachian Trail, which stretches from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine. The AT, as it's affectionately known to thousands of hikers, offers an astonishing landscape of silent forests and sparkling lakes--and to a writer with the comic genius of Bill Bryson, it also provides endless opportunities to test his own powers of ineptitude, and to witness the majestic silliness of his fellow human beings.<\/p> <p>For a start, there's the gloriously out-of-shape Stephen Katz, a buddy from Iowa who accompanies the similarly unfit Bryson on the trail. Once Bryson and Katz settle into their stride, it's not long before they come across the fabulously annoying Mary Ellen, whose disappearance ruins a perfectly good slice of pie, a gang of Ralph Lauren-attired yuppies from whom Katz appropriates a key piece of equipment, and a security guard in Pennsylvania who, for no ascertainable reason, impounds Bryson's car. Mile by arduous mile these latter-day pioneers walk America, along the way surviving the threat of bear attacks, the loss of key provisions, and everything else this awe-inspiring country can throw at them.<\/p> <p>But <i>A Walk in the Woods<\/i> is more than just a laugh-out-loud hike. Bryson's acute eye is a wise witness to this fragile and beautiful trail, and as he tells its fascinating history, he makes a moving plea for the conservation of America's last great wilderness. An adventure, a comedy, a lament, and a celebration, <i>A Walk in the Woods<\/i> is destined to become a modern classic of travel literature.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/d\/6\/5\/600_439528005.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Book Availability at the Howard Count Public Library<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>A Walk in the Woods<\/b> is available for checkout at the Howard County Public Library. The Howard County Public Library has:<\/p> <p>(14) Copies of the book; 276 pages.<\/p> <p>(6) ebook copies.<\/p> <p>(3) Copies as books on CD.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Howard County Library, East Columbia Branch<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n6600 Cradlerock Way<\/p> <p>Columbia MD 21045<\/p> <p>\n\nBranch Hours<\/p> <p>Mon. - Thurs. 10 am - 9 pm<\/p> <p>Fri. - Sat. 10 am - 6 pm<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Discussion Questions<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n1. One of the most interesting aspects of this book is the unlikely friendship between Bryson and Katz. What is the relationship based on? Consider, especially, the episode in Maine when Katz gets lost: somehow the friendship is altered. How does Bryson's attitude toward Katz change over the course of the book? How does Katz himself change? Or does he? What was Katz's motivation, anyway, to walk the AT?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n2. The book offers an excellent microscope through which to examine the meaning of friendship\u2014our own friendships. Do the two men remind you of friends who tested your patience, but who exhibited intense loyalty?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n3. In fiction a journey usually symbolizes a journey of self-discovery\u2014at the end the protagonist comes to learn something about him\/herself. Although A Walk isn't a novel, do either of the men come to greater self-awareness by the end of their journey?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n4. The tone of the book veers back and forth between humor and seriousness, even anger. In fact, the book is a sort of jeremiad against environmental threats to the great wilderness areas of the country. Is Bryson's anger justified? He criticizes, but does he offer solutions? Are there solutions?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n5. Katz pokes fun at rural Southerners, which some readers find funny, others find offensive. You?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n6. Bryson ponders the attraction of hiking: ''You have no engagements, commitments, obligations, or duties; no special ambitions and only the smallest, least complicated of wants; you exist in a tranquil tedium, serenely beyond the reach of exasperation.\" If you're a hiker, backpacker, camper, are your experiences similar to or different from Bryson's? For those who aren't hikers, are there other avenues to \"exist in a tranquil tedium\"?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n7. You might also talk about the numerous characters Bryson and Katz meet on the trail. Mary Ellen is one, for instance: how do you feel about their treatment of her?<\/p>",

Hope you enjoy!<\/p> <p><i>David Sedaris returns to his deliriously twisted domain: hilarious childhood dramas infused with melancholy; the gulf of misunderstanding that exists between people of different nations or members of the same family; and the poignant divide between one's best hopes and most common deeds.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The family characters his readers love are all here, as well as the unique terrain they inhabit, strewn with comic landmines. 'The Rooster' is back, and getting married in the funniest wedding ever described. David attends a slumber party and gets the upper hand in a unique version of strip poker. 'Rubber or plastic?' The strangest questions can tear people apart. A skinny guy from Spain, wearing a bishop's hat and accompanied by six to eight men, invades your house and pretends to kick you. Is this any way to spend Christmas?\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>With this new book, Sedaris's prose reaches breathtaking new heights and marks off a territory that is unmistakably his own. Read it and weep tears of humane laughter.<\/i><\/p>",

Every day around the world, cultures celebrate, honor and signify meaningful events with toasts, usually involving a libation, heartfelt words and the clinking of glasses. Whether toasting the Almighty, the head of state, the wedding party or an award recipient, we toast for health, wealth, happiness, safe passage, healing or any of a number of noble and sometimes frivolous aspirations.<\/p> <p>Yet few people know the history behind this ritual. It\u2019s a tradition that began centuries ago. \u201cThe ancient Hebrews, Persians and Egyptians were toasters, as were the Saxons, Huns and other tribes,\u201d Paul Dickson writes in his book Toasts: Over 1,500 of the Best Toasts, Sentiments, Blessings and Graces.<\/p> <p>In his 18th-century history book The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbons wrote about toasting, Dickson notes. Gibbons described a feast among the Huns at which their leader, Attila, led no less than three rounds of toasts for each course of an elaborate dinner.<\/p> <p>Ancient Greeks drank to each other\u2019s health and welfare. In The Odyssey, Ulysses drank to the health of Achilles. The idea of poison\u2014which was a potent weapon in the sixth century B.C.\u2014also came into play. According to David Fulmer\u2019s book A Gentleman\u2019s Guide to Toasting, toasting was \u201ca good faith gesture to assure the drink wasn\u2019t spiked with poison.\u201d The best way to prove a drink was safe for sipping was to take the first sip. Just as a handshake assured others that nothing was hidden up one\u2019s sleeve, drinking a shared libation in front of others signified to all its worthiness for consumption.<\/p> <p>The Romans built upon this Greek custom of drinking to others\u2019 health and well-being: They added toasted bread crumbs to their goblets, reducing the acidity of the often bitter wine. Thus came the appellation \u201cto toast\u201d\u2014 referring to the drink itself\u2014from the Latin term \u201ctostus,\u201d meaning \u201cto dry up\" or \"scorch.\" In Rome, \"drinking to another\u2019s health became so important, the Senate decreed that all diners must drink to Augustus [the first Roman emperor] at every meal,\u201d Dickson writes. \u201cFabius Maximus [the Roman politician and general] declared that no man should eat or drink before he had prayed for [Maximus] and drank to his health.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Clinking of Glasses<br\/>The toasting custom spread throughout Europe and England, where for the first time the clinking of glasses accompanied the ritual. Whether its intent was to mix the content of each other\u2019s glasses so everyone drank the same grog (lessening the likelihood of being poisoned), or to add sound to the experience of taste, touch, smell and sight, no one is sure.<\/p> <p>In the 17th century, toasting became very popular, says Dickson. Eventually, the position of \u201ctoastmaster\u201d emerged. In England, the toastmaster presided over events, delivering and soliciting appropriate toasts. \u201cIn those days the duties of the toastmaster tended to be referee-like in that his main function was to give all toasters a fair chance to make their contribution,\u201d writes Dickson in his book.<\/p> <p>He adds that one of the earliest books on toasting\u2014if not the earliest\u2014was The Royal Toastmaster by J. Roach, published in London in 1791. Roach\u2019s view was that the toast is a very powerful ritual. Consider this passage from his book:<\/p> <p>A Toast or Sentiment very frequently excites good humor, and revives languid conversation; often does it, when properly applied, cool the heat of resentment, and blunt the edge of animosity. A well-applied Toast is acknowledged, universally, to soothe the flame of acrimony, when season and reason oft used their efforts to no purpose.<\/p> <p>To this day, one can find the National Association of Toastmasters in the United Kingdom\u2014whose trained members wear ceremonial red dinner jackets and are skilled at oratory, poetry and toasting. They emcee events of all varieties, from weddings and funerals to christenings and fundraisers.<\/p> <p>Dickson describes a Golden Age of toasting in America during the 40-year period from approximately 1880 to 1920. Many prominent authors wrote toasts, toast books and pamphlets were published, and newspapers ran columns on the subject. One periodical, The National Magazine, had its own Toasts editor, whose duties included judging the best toasts in a monthly contest, Dickson says.<\/p> <p>Traveling Toasts<br\/>Worldwide, numerous nations and cultures have their own toasting customs. Many are similar to each other yet others are unique. For example, in Japan, China and Korea, the customary toasts sound very similar but are pronounced differently. According to the Matador Network (www.matadornetwork.com), a site devoted to travel journalism, toasters in Japan say the word kanpai and pronounce it \u201ckan-pie\u201d; in China they say gan bei and pronounce it \u201cgan bay\u201d; in Korea they say gonbae and pronounce it \u201cgun bae.\u201d<\/p> <p>And Korean toasting customs differ from the Japanese. \u201cIn Korea, the glass is emptied and the last few drops are shaken out, then it is passed to the guest and the host refills the glass,\u201d says the website Etiquette International (www.etiquetteinternational.com). \u201cA glass is never refilled until it is completely empty in Korea, whereas in Japan the glass is constantly refilled so it is never empty.\u201d<\/p> <p>If you\u2019re going to make a toast in another country, notes the site, be sure to find out the toasting customs there \u201cbefore putting your foot in your mouth.\u201d \u201cToasts don\u2019t necessarily translate well, especially if they are idiomatic or poetic,\u201d adds Etiquette International. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to stick to safe topics like friendship, the enjoyment of life and health.\u201d<\/p> <p>The ancient and international tradition of toasting is no doubt one that will endure for many more years. Let\u2019s hope the future of the toast is as engrossing as its past.<\/p>",

She locks her huge brown eyes with a client\u2019s and asks directly, but respectfully, \u201cDo you really need this? Why? How does it make you feel when I take it away?\u201d And very occasionally, when a person seems unreasonably attached to a shopping bag of old birthday cards or an ugly ashtray pilfered from a restaurant in Greece, she pulls out the tough love: \u201cAre you going to give me trouble with this?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>As the host of the Discovery Home Channel\u2019s hit show\u00a0Neat, Buttigieg provides clutter control and guidance to a new household every week. She\u2019s something between an organizer and a headshrinker, with certifications as a professional organizer and as a life coach. She simultaneously cleans out closets while slowly uncovering subconscious \u201cblocks\u201d that make a person want to hoard junk or prevent them from putting their dirty clothes in the hamper.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Her gentle leadership made a lifelong fan out of client Denise Fujiwara, who says Buttigieg \u201cis a living example of what you can do with an affirmative attitude.\u201d The Toronto-based choreographer was lost trying to sort out her home office to make room for a house renovation when she called in Buttigieg to help. As someone who runs her own choreography business and dance troupe, Fujiwara\u2019s office is prone to clutter. \u201cMy office was a horrendous mess,\u201d she says. She describes stacks of boxes, piles of unfiled papers, photographs, video tapes, press releases \u2013 essentially 15 years\u2019 worth of disorder and confusion.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d tried to sort it out in the past, but I hadn\u2019t had the skills to do it properly until I worked with Hellen. In about 6 hours, she did what I couldn\u2019t do in 15 years,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The two went around the room in an orderly way, starting at the door and working clockwise. \u201cOccasionally, I\u2019d get stuck on something, and she\u2019d push me to make a decision,\u201d says Fujiwara. \u201cShe pushed through, and in the end I felt euphoric to be relieved of all that stuff.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg unloads stuff with a dancer\u2019s grace and a politician\u2019s diplomacy. Anyone would think she was born taking charge of people\u2019s unruly environs, teaching them how to be better organized. In a way, that\u2019s true. She says she was always organized, even as a teenager, when most kids live among piles of laundry, music collections and notebooks. She was also always a confident speaker. In grammar school, she was the girl who narrated the school plays.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In fact, Buttigieg moves and speaks so naturally in front of the camera and with such calm assertiveness, no one would guess that not long ago she was at a loss for what to do with her life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI had been out of the workforce for almost 10 years as a stay-at-home mom, but I lacked confidence, and I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she says from her home in Oakville, a suburb of Toronto, Canada.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She graduated from Seneca College in Toronto with a degree in radio and television broadcasting, and worked briefly as an administrator and fitness instructor. But then she had two children and took off nearly 10 years from work to raise them. Those 10 years at home had slowly whittled away her confidence as a businessperson, but she still wanted to launch a new career \u2013 and have some adult conversation. Her solution? In 1999, she joined City Centre Toastmasters.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cToastmasters changed my life,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She means that in the most literal sense. It started with one of the first lessons any new Toastmaster learns: talk about what you know. Buttigieg started writing speeches about what she knew, and as someone who was naturally neat, she talked about organizing. And then at one contest she gave a speech called \u201cSimple Simon\u201d about simplifying your life by letting go of clutter, and it launched a new career.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cGiving speeches is a journey of self-discovery,\u201d she says. \u201cHow often in life do people really listen to us? At Toastmasters, people are truly listening; they\u2019re not thinking about what they\u2019ll say back. It\u2019s a safe place to speak, so I could use my speeches to work out what resonated with the audience.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>And also what resonated with her. That speech was the nugget that now sits at the center of her professional life. In fact, she still uses parts of the same speech today when she gives presentations: \u201cIf you would like to get a taste of the simple life, don\u2019t let\u00a0stuff\u00a0complicate it. Commit to following these three simple steps: If you don\u2019t use it, lose it; if you don\u2019t need it, don\u2019t buy it; and when you bring one item in, take one item out.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>This would become her mantra in several ways. It sparked her desire to become a life coach and also tapped into her abilities as an organizer. Starting her own organizing business, called WeOrganizeU, helped pay for the life-coaching certification. Soon, a group of producers approached her about a new show that would blend her gifts for tidying up with her ability to lead people, and by 2004\u00a0Neat\u00a0hit the North American airwaves.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg credits Toastmasters with more than just sparking a good idea; she also says she honed her skills as a leader and built confidence. Shalini Alleluia, president of City Centre Toastmasters, says Buttigieg faced a short learning curve thanks to her take-charge attitude.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cHellen had lots of energy and was articulate and vibrant,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe always smiled and was willing to try anything.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Alleluia says even though Buttigieg was a new member, she asked her to chair a speech contest and encouraged her to assume meeting roles. Soon Buttigieg was helping others to be better speakers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI think Hellen was more of a mentor to other people than other people being a mentor to her,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe has a charisma that makes people want to follow her and to be like her in personality and capability. She\u2019s a good listener, and she always pays attention to the evaluation notes. I once told her she was very loud and didn\u2019t have expression in her delivery, and she really listened.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Like any good Toastmaster, Buttigieg is still seeking advice on how to improve. She still asks Alleluia for feedback on her presentations and episodes of the TV show. \u201cI\u2019m honest, and I\u2019ll tell her what I thought the show lacked or what I learned,\u201d says Alleluia.\u00a0<\/p> <p>While Alleluia coaches Buttigieg to improve some public speaking skills, her student is working toward a broader purpose. \u201cI\u2019m a teacher,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel that whether I\u2019m organizing or coaching or speaking, there\u2019s still that element of wanting to pass on the information I know to improve other people\u2019s lives.\u201d<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead The\u00a0Toastmaster\u00a0on Your iPad!<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/iPadMag\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/iPadMag<\/a><\/p> <p>Access the Toastmasters International iPad\u00ae app by following these steps:<\/p> <p>1.

        "description": "<p>Chartered in 1986, the Rotary members of Columbia\/Patuxent are a diverse group of business and professional leaders from the Columbia and Howard County area who take an active role in their communities while enriching their personal and professional lives.<br\/>We volunteer in communities at home and abroad to help those in need, support education and job training, provide clean water, combat hunger and improve the health and lives of so many. We are the county\u2019s largest club and each year we are active in the most service projects. We raise and give more money than any other club in the county. To date we have contributed $150,000 to the Rotary Foundation.<\/p> <p>Thanks to our club\u2019s ongoing fundraising efforts, we have funded local<br\/>and international projects totaling more than $1 million!<\/p> <p>We are proud to have the most diverse group of multi-cultural Rotarians that includes a wide age range and nearly 40% professional women.<br\/>We take pride in the fact that our meetings are fun, the wit is quick, the guest speakers are interesting, and the work that gets done is the best it can be... all while never forgetting to take time to sit back and have a party, celebrate success and enjoy each others\u2019 company as fellow caring human beings.<br\/>Our club is one of the best ways to lead and stay connected to your community. If you believe that you have a responsibility to give back to the community with a little of your time, energy and expertise, and if you believe that your business should be represented in a group of self-motivated people who believe the same thing, then we hope you will consider visiting our club. You just may be surprised at the camaraderie, the fun and the relevance of what we do for so many.<br\/>We hope to see you soon.<\/p>",

On some days, you will hike, crawl, lunge, and have a fun time while burning a ton of fat and meeting new people. It's always an adventure!

I do have a few ground rules I must cover first:<\/p> <p>1. This is a 21+ meetup! I do not want to go to jail for any underage drinking.<br\/>2. I must ask you keep away from my parents liquor cabinet downstairs. I will have drinks available or you can BYOB.<br\/>3. If you have to throw up, please do so outside or in the bathroom. I will have the meetup upstairs, with access to our porch outside, instead of downstairs. I don't want to clean that up! DX<br\/>4. If you are driving, please keep in mind how much you drink, I do not want to be responsible for any drunk driving that occurs.<\/p> <p>Failure to follow any of these rules will be banned from my house. I am responsible for everyone attending and want to make sure that everyone feels safe while having fun as well. I also may want to do another one of these in the near future. Thanks Ya'll!<\/p>",

Aug. 23 <\/b><\/p> <p><b>Martinak State Park, Denton, MD (45 Mins from Annapolis)<\/b><\/p> <p>Become a (more) skilled and competent trip leader by participating in this fun, challenging weekend course! It is designed for paddlers who are currently leading trips and for those who want to do so. The focus is on knowledgeable and safe trip leading, not paddling instruction. It is open to members of Baltimore\/Washington area meet-up groups and paddling organizations such as the CPA.<\/p> <p>The course will be based at Martinak State Park near Denton, MD (about 45 minutes from Annapolis). It will run from Friday evening, August 28 to late Sunday afternoon, August 30. Most people will be camping at the (really nice) Martinak State Park campground, but there are also reasonably-priced motels nearby.<\/p> <p>Successful completion of the course will enable participants to receive \u2013 if they so desire - formal trip leader certification by the American Canoe Association. Certification is an option; it is not a requirement for participation.<\/p> <p><b>The Course<\/b><\/p> <p>The course will be mostly water-based, but will also include some classroom components. Topics and skills to be covered include:<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Qualities of good trip leaders<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Trip preparation and planning, including identification of bail out points and contingency plans for bad weather<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Group on-water formations and communication (paddle signals, VHF radio use)<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Risk assessment and \u201csea sense\u201d<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Incorporating tides and currents into trip planning<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Use of chart and compass for navigation<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Group and personal safety equipment, including signaling devices<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Review of basic paddling skills including rescues and towing<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Pre-launch group briefing<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Incident management scenarios (a lot of incident management!)<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Leadership principles and<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Much more!<\/p> <p>This will be a great opportunity for you to build your personal paddling and leadership skill set. Every participant will have the opportunity to lead the group at various points throughout the weekend and to deal with real-life (or invented if need be) situations as they arise.<\/p> <p><b>The Instructors<\/b><\/p> <p>Rick Wiebush will be the primary instructor for this course. Rick is an ACA Instructor Trainer, an Open Water Instructor, \u00a0and a BCU 4* leader. As an ACA instructor he is qualified to train and certify people as day trip leaders. In addition, Rick has led numerous trips locally on both flat and rough water, and has also led extended trips to places like Baja and Florida\u2019s 10,000 islands.<\/p> <p>Additional instructors will be added if there are more than five people in the course. These instructors might include Tom Noffsinger (ACA L5 Instructor) and\/or Paula Hubbard and\/or Mike Hamilton (both ACA L3 Instructors) and\/or Greg Hollingsworth (ACA L2 Instructor).<\/p> <p><b>Camping at Martinak<\/b><\/p> <p>Martinak State Park has really nice, tree-covered camping areas. There are 60+ camp sites and half of them have electricity. There are also several camper cabins, which sleep 4 people.<\/p> <p><b>Registration and Costs<\/b><\/p> <p>To register you can RSVP here, but you also need to email Rick at <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a> to have a conversation about your experience and interests for the class. We can also discuss the details for the weekend at that time.<\/p> <p>The cost for this training is $195.<\/p> <p><b>Kayaking involves known and unanticipated risks including physical injury and death that cannot be eliminated without jeopardizing the essential quality of the sport. Group organizers and leaders and other members cannot pay continuous attention to all participants. Participants must be responsible for their own safety. Don\u2019t overestimate your skills and abilities. Take instructional courses to learn about paddling technique, safety, self-rescue and hypothermia. Be aware of the tides, currents and weather conditions that will affect your safety on the days you paddle. Cooperate with group organizers, leaders and other members to insure your own safety as well as the safety of others and make it the fun, enjoyable day on the water it should be.<\/b><\/p>",

Movies are projected\u00a0<\/i><i>from a row home across the street\u00a0<\/i><i>onto the outside wall of Ciao Bella Restaurant. Folks arrive early to set up lawn chairs, listen to live entertainment, stroll the neighborhood, and eat at one of Little Italy's many restaurants.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Instrumental in allowing this event to be created was the late \"Mr. John\" Pente, who wholeheartedly supported the Film Fest for the last 11 years of his life. Mr. John died in 2011 at age 100 after living in The Neighborhood for his entire life. He allowed a movie projector to be set up in his third floor bedroom window ... all for the good of the neighborhood. His nephew, the late Ray Lancelotta who died in 2014, had then purchased the home and generously continued the Film Fest tradition. For 2015, the Lancelotta family has again stepped up to continue the Film Fest.<\/i><\/p>",

The rugged cliffs on the summit are composed primarily of quartzite, the predominant type of rock on the mountain.<\/p> <p>A trail map can be found here:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sugarloafmd.com\/images\/maps\/102709_trailmap.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.sugarloafmd.com\/images\/maps\/102709_trailmap.pdf<\/a><\/p> <p>Again, PLEASE be on time as I will start this hike at 10.<\/p> <p>PLEASE POST IF YOU WANT TO CARPOOL.<\/p> <p>Can't wait to see you all there!\u00a0 :)<\/p> <p>Shannon<\/p> <p>------------------DISCLAIMER----------------------<\/p> <p><br\/>By signing up for this hike you have read and agree to this disclaimer.<\/p> <p>DISCLAIMER: \u201cHiking Around Baltimore (HAB)\u201d group and its event\/assistant organizers (the \"Organizers\") are not responsible for your safety.

Beginner kayakers are provided kayaking instruction and skill building tips in a safe and controlled environment in one of our beautiful park pools. Not a beginner and just want to practice? We can go over the basics of rescue techniques and wet exits. We will be at the Cherry Hill Splash Park every Saturday from 1-3 pm there is a $2 general admission to enter the pool. Some folks just need a 15 min refresher and others want to just hang out at the pool. We recommend you bring a chair and what ever else you need to spend the afternoon at the pool. There is a 3 story spiral water slide at this pool(FYI)! Please come dressed to swim in the pool!<\/p> <p>Participants must be 50 pounds and up and children under 18 must be accompanied by a parent to kayak. RESERVATIONS ARE RECOMMENDED.<\/p>",

If the piece is priced $10, the firing charge is half that so the total would be $15 + tax. We're allowed to bring snacks and drinks (even wine if we really want to get our creative juices flowing.)<\/p> <p>So put on that beret, pull out your artist's palette and prepare to have some fun at Hot Pots!

The ride starts at Harford and Argonne (where the side road goes down to the playground) at 6:20 am. They are usually punctual on the time. It is a fast casual ride - strong riders, but not racers and some are on hybrids or cyclocross. It loops the city, going through major parks for about 28 miles, stopping in South Baltimore for a break. It finishes around 9:00 am at Lake Montebello. Many people will hook up on the ride at different areas of the City - either 39th and Greenmount, or Druid Hill Park by the Conservatory: <a href=\"http:\/\/baltimore.about.com\/od\/parks\/ss\/druidhillconsv.htm\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/baltimore.about.com\/od\/parks\/ss\/druidhillconsv.htm<\/a><\/p>",

An intensely personal journey into the past that offers vital lessons for the future, Prague Winter combines the intimacy of an autobiography with the drama of an exciting and well-told story\u2014all underpinned by the gravity and intelligence of a serious work of history. The result is a highly readable and incisive work filled with tragedy and triumph, a resonant narrative informed by Albright\u2019s remarkable life experience and her characteristic candor in speaking hard truths.<\/p> <p>NOTE: \u00a0Google Play has a special edition of this book for $6.99. \u00a0The blurb for the e-book states, \"The enhanced e-book includes ten video interviews and one audio clip with Albright. \u00a0In this special edition, Albright reveals how this book is different from any other book she's written and pores over personal photos, family documents, and even a Slovak costume that she wore as a young girl to tell you the stories that bring these artifacts to life.\"<\/p> <p>(While I prefer reading books from the public library, I have to admit I'm enjoying books on my tablet more and more because I can increase the font size. \u00a0Ahh, the vagaries of age.)<\/p>",

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\". That way, we know not to be waiting for you. Thanks.<\/b><\/p> <p>So come join us on Sunday for a brisk walk in the park. It's a great way to clean out the cobwebs and start a Sunday.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

Religious Science is a foundation of thought that allows our spiritual selves to be individual and connected all at the same time.<\/p> <p>To truly build something of great value and consequence in the world we must take a cue from nature. Like the elders of the earth, our mighty trees, let us grow tall and strong with unique and individual gifts to share while being deeply rooted in the soil that provides life for all. Let us move and be moved like the malleable yet sturdy branches that blow with the wind. Let us be one with each other and the world so that we thrive in a world that truly works for everyone.<\/p> <p>Our speaker this week is Reverend Brian Akers, Senior Minister of the Columbia Center for Spiritual Living.\u00a0 Come to this Meetup and see if CCSL is the spiritual community that you have been looking for.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/9\/7\/4\/600_422410612.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Ever wanted to try a new game? How about geocaching?\u00a0 For the last two summers, Geocaching.com has hosted a summer program to get people out and about to learn about geocaching. This year is no different, so we have decided to go ahead and grab this opportunity to host our own meet n greet in hopes of linking local cachers and local gamers, uniting these two hobbies.\u00a0 Nancy and I love all things gaming and geocaching gets you out exploring the world we live in all awhile playing the ultimate scavenger hunting game.<\/p> <p><br\/>This will be a casual cook out style meet n greet. We will provide the main course ie burgers and dogs and are asking that u bring a yummy side dish to share. Please post in your RSVP what food item u will be bringing so we can have an idea of what will be served. Also this is BYOB. This event will be hosted at our home and we do own a dog.. so if you are not dog friendly, please be advised. You may want to bring a pop up chair to place on the deck as I\u2019m unsure if we will have enough seating for everyone. Come and bring a friend that may be interested in geocaching. You will hear stories of the hobby we all love so much, hopefully peaking your interest.<br\/>We have lots of games on hand\u2026 so between the swapping of geocache stories let\u2019s get some games going where we do not have to get covered in spider webs to get the prize. If you have a game and want to play it, bring one you want to play or feel free to try one we have.<\/p> <p><br\/>Please park on our street.\u00a0 There is ample parking but please do not block anyone in or out of their driveway.\u00a0 Hope to see you all there.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>KID FRIENDLY EVENT!<\/p>",

A Sunday Assembly service consists of songs (pop songs mainly) sung by the congregation, a reading (usually a poet), an interesting talk (that fits into live better, help often or wonder more), a moment of reflection and an address, which sums up the day and hopefully gives a take home message. Afterwards we have tea and cake (well, in Britain anyway!) to encourage people to stay and mingle with one another.

        "description": "<p>On numerous occasions we have been asked if they're one on one instructor lead workshops? Well, we are now offering this once a month instructor lead series of workshops.\u00a0<\/p> <p>These workshops are designed for 1 - 3 shooters only, and the organizer\/instructor. Each participating shooter will have their own studio setup (lights, reflector, model, etc.) and workshop objectives to complete in this 4 hour workshop.\u00a0<\/p> <p>All shooting levels are welcomed, this is a great way to get your photography skills raised with \"Hands-On\" experiences while getting your questions answered while you work.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The most important element in photography is the light. So how you see it and how to use it to help create your vision is a key objective in our workshops. Know matter if you are a landscape or people shooter. The light can happen all at once or continuos, the creative challenge remains the same.\u00a0<\/p> <p>So we will dive into \"The Science and Art of Taking Pictures.\" And as always (but deeper,) we will review items that make a good image:<\/p> <p><br\/>Subject<br\/>Composition<br\/>Light and<br\/>Exposure<\/p> <p>This series would be best if you have participated in one of our previous group workshops, but not a requirement. Everything is geared towards your skill level and abilities. We do things \"Hands-On!\" Good ole multi sensory learning type approach. :)<\/p> <p>The list of what we are going to cover in each of these workshops is long, but again it will be driven by the participants experience level and interests. But some of the items we will cover:<\/p> <p>Light and modifiers<br\/>Mix lighting setups<br\/>Proper lens selection for output<br\/>Creating a storyboard<br\/>Set design<br\/>Model selection<br\/>Model Posing<br\/>Post (Digital Darkroom and Workflows)<br\/>Styling and Stylist selection<\/p> <p>The range in which we will be shooting the models in will be:\u00a0<\/p> <p>Fashion<br\/>Fitness<br\/>Glamour<\/p> <p>Those three categories will give us a vast range of options with the models TDMVPW works with. The number of models depends on the number of participates, and yes the models will rotate to each shooters setup.<\/p> <p>Once you RSVP, there will be a few questions asked. Then the organizer will contact you to help fine tune your experience in photography and your goals you wish to reach from the workshop.<\/p> <p>We will do our best to offer this small one on one type workshop once a month. If you join us more than once we will elevate your experience each time based on where you are with your shooting goals on that occasion.<\/p> <p>We hope to see you there, this is the cradle to grave offer!<\/p> <p>Happy shooting!<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b><i>PLEASE NOTE:<\/i><\/b>\u00a0Our workshops are not a \"Shoot-Out\" or \"Run-and-Gun\" type of experience, we do not offer those types of workshops! Our workshops are for those who would like to really know more about photography and improving their skills.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/9\/f\/e\/600_434023518.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/6\/5\/600_441080837.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/7\/e\/600_441080862.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/8\/1\/600_441080865.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/8\/5\/600_441080869.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/a\/1\/600_441080897.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/a\/a\/600_441080906.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/a\/f\/600_441080911.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/b\/6\/600_441080918.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",
