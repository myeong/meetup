Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

Malcolm is a geek, carefully surviving life in The Bottoms, a tough neighborhood in Inglewood, CA filled gangsters and drugs dealers, while juggling his senior year of college applications, interviews and the SAT. His dream is to attend Harvard. A chance invitation to a big underground party leads Malcolm and his friends into a, only in Los Angeles, gritty adventure filed with offbeat characters and bad choices. If Malcolm can persevere, he'll go from being a geek, to being dope, to ultimately being himself.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/sXw4q83nVGA\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/sXw4q83nVGA<\/a><\/p>",

A component of Abstract Algebra, CT strives to find powerful generalizations and proofs that encompass logic, mathematics, and topology. More recently it is being applied to many forms of logic and semantic problems. Recent work by David Spivak on \u201cCategorical Theory for Scientists\u201d and \u201c Categorical Databases\u201d has opened up interesting new ways to applying CT to many kinds of data query and analytic applications. All of logic (FOL, HOL, boolean, Heyting algebra, subclassifiers) is within the realm of CT, but it can be used to map data models from one system to another (ontology alignment and data migration), as well as generate new constructs (cartesian products). A key feature identified by Spivak is that RDF can be described in CT as a Grothendieck Construction, representing both typed set values and relations (fundamental elements of CT), thereby preserving data meaning (graph structure) throughout information processes.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Dr. Neumann is Vice President of Knowledge Informatics at Foundation Medicine, where he is responsible for organizing FMI\u2019s knowledge assets. He is a recognized world expert in semantic information and data modeling for life sciences, and has worked on many information initiatives for the pharmaceutical and life sciences, including the W3C Semantic Web Healthcare and Life Science Interest Group (HCLSIG).\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Eric has been a consultant for several pharmaceutical companies on how to improve their management of scientific and pharmacological information. Prior to FMI, Eric was a founder and CTO of PanGenX, a personalized medicine company. Eric was also the Global Head of Knowledge Management for Scientific and Medical Affairs within Sanofi-Aventis, overseeing the reuse of knowledge and insights across a multinational company.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Eric is a graduate from MIT and holds a PhD in neurobiology, developmental genetics, and pharmacology from Case Western Reserve University.<\/i><\/p>",

We welcome new additions to the group, and it's great to see new friendships being made over board games and cards...<\/p> <p>Although we start around 6:30pm or so, early birds can take advantage of their half-price happy hour menu. These are full-portion sized appetizers for real cheap! If not, you'll still be able to take advantage of the monthly specials<\/p> <p>\n\n\nHOW TO GET THERE<\/p> <p>This location is easily accessible from Rt. 16, Rt. 28 and Rt. 93, and is walking distance from the T, near the new Station Landing apartment complex.<\/p> <p>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p>",

DSC provides a consistent, declarative way to apply and maintain the configuration of servers regardless of the environment they're deployed in. In this presentation, after a quick intro to DSC, we'll explore how it can be used in conjunction with CloudFormation to bootstrap servers launched into an AWS environment. We'll also see how once your servers are up and running, DSC can be used to ensure they stay configured the way you want them. <b><br\/>Presenter: <\/b>Joe Grenier is a Senior Software Engineer with BlueMetal Architects.

        "description": "<p>As one of the few times Nero Wolfe ever leaves his New York home, The Black Mountain is a significant departure from Stout's very successful formula - 33 novels and 40 novellas featuring Nero Wolfe. \u00a0With the nearly immobile and supremely rational Wolfe and the All-American Archie Goodwin as the recorder and narrator of his exploits, Stout created an interesting hybrid that incorporated the British puzzle mystery and the American action mystery. This one should provide some good material with which to understand these two important directions of the crime and mystery genre. \u00a0But it also contains an interesting historical snapshot of Cold War politics and attitudes. \u00a0And, if my memory serves me well, it should be an entertaining read. \u00a0See you in June.<\/p>",

Working with buyers to purchase a home for them to live in and<\/p> <p>2. Working with sellers by listing and their home.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Learn how to add additional revenue streams to your real estate business by attending this lunch and learn event hosted by Tom Cafarella of Ocean City Development. The presentation will focus on adding additional revenue streams to your real estate brokerage business including:<\/p> <p><br\/>1. <b>Making money by helping us acquire properties<\/b>: Think it would be easier to approach an expired listing or FSBO with an offer in hand from a cash buyer? \u00a0We'll show you how to easily get in front of more sellers.<br\/>2. <b>Our Automated Short Sale System:<\/b> \u00a0Learn how to capitalize on short sales while keeping your sanity. \u00a0Our automated short sale program allows agents to spend a very limited amount of time and effort while maximizing their commissions.<br\/>3. <b>Buyer Lead Overflow:<\/b> we don't work with buyers, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't. \u00a0Learn how working with an investor can provide you with an overflow of buyer leads and how we generate these leads(mostly by accident).<br\/>4. <b>Learn how to make money by wholesaling properties &amp; raising capital<\/b>: we'll show you how to easily and effectively add these two revenue streams to your real estate business.<\/p> <p>As an added bonus, we will be reviewing our best practices and systems to allow you to leverage your time and efforts in 2015. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Tom is a principle of Ocean City Development and is head of acquisitions.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

Throughout his career, Leonardo experimented with various types of drawings: scientific studies; grotesque caricatures of craggy faces; and the most beautiful faces of men and women that he could imagine. Many of Leonardo\u2019s most admired drawings are featured in this rich and varied selection of 29 sheets and a manuscript, opening on April 15, fittingly Leonardo\u2019s\u00a0birthday.<\/p> <p>One revelation for visitors will be the rarely displayed\u00a0<i>Codex on Flight<\/i>, one of Leonardo\u2019s most perceptive scientific explorations, with its nearly hidden self-portrait of Leonardo as a young man, a recent discovery. The exhibition features rare loans from a number of Italian public collections, including the Uffizi Museum in Florence, the Biblioteca Reale in Turin, and the Casa Buonarroti, the ancestral property of Michelangelo in Florence, which has lent eight drawings by that\u00a0master.<\/p> <p><b>Restoring a Legacy :\u00a0Rothschild Family Treasures<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/a\/0\/0\/600_437406656.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>This exhibition celebrates recent gifts to the MFA that tell a story of a great European collection, which was looted during the Nazi era and ultimately restored to its rightful owners. The collection of 186 objects, originally owned by Baron and Baroness Alphonse and Clarice de Rothschild of Vienna, includes European decorative arts, furniture, prints, drawings, paintings, and personal objects including jewelry and jeweled objects, miniatures, and rare books, and is a gift of the heirs of Bettina Looram de Rothschild, who was a daughter of the Baron and Baroness.

        "description": "<p>My name is Bill Zinke, and at age 88 I am a person with a cause. The cause is to integrate the large and growing population segment of people 50+ more effectively into the economic and social fabric of America. I founded Enrich Life Over 50 to see this cause effectively achieved.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our goal is to create a National Network of Chapters cities for People 50+ in 27 major throughout the U.S. Boston will be the first one to launch because of its historic role in American history. It follows a successful pilot meeting we held in Raleigh, NC on March 14, which attracted 80 people 50+.\u00a0 That event\u2019s final session was titled \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20150422005214\/en\/Phenomenal-Advantages-Older-Workers#.VTgc22RVhBe\"><i>The Phenomenal Aspects of Growing Older<\/i><\/a>\u201d and featured two speakers: Dr. Janice Wassel, Assistant Professor of Gerontology at UNC Greensboro, and Judge William H. Webster, a well-known national leader who has served most of his life in public-service roles as a Federal Court of Appeals Judge, Director of the FBI and the CIA at different times and as Chairman of the Homeland Security Advisory Council since 2002. At age 91, he is still involved in numerous activities, including serving as a Director of ELO50. Bill Webster epitomizes the reality that many people in their 70s, 80s and 90s can continue adding value in America.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The first meeting of the ELO50 Boston Chapter has the following two speakers already confirmed: Rev. Bill Harding, the Minister of the Church and Bill Zinke, Founder and President of ELO50.\u00a0Each speaker will talk for 20 minutes, followed by 20 minutes of questions and group interaction. There will also be 60 minutes devoted to a moderated roundtable session devoted to any subjects participants would like to discuss, and one hour when the meeting ends devoted to socializing with refreshments.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Some of the benefits of joining the ELO50 Boston Chapter are: acquiring new learning from the presentations and group interaction; gaining new perspectives on how to remain productively engaged and socially connected; resolving problems and developing new opportunities through discussion with similarly-situated people; participating in building a community of like-minded people with shared interests.<\/p> <p>There will be 10 Chapter meetings per year, excluding July and August. The charge to join ELO50 is $500 annually, $750 for a member with significant other. The price for this meeting is $50, as it is the first and will be followed by a two-month hiatus. The balance of $450 for one person and $700 for a couple will be charged in September.<\/p> <p>We hope many of you will join this action-oriented new group and support our cause. Please visit\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/elo50.com\/\">elo50.com<\/a>\u00a0for more information and to register for the ELO50 Boston meeting.<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Bill Zinke<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Ever feel like your T-SQL solution to a tricky issue was almost just as difficult as the problem itself? Ever find yourself unable to cleanly express the logic you really need in T-SQL for your complex data calculation? Don't blame yourself--blame the limitations of the language. Get ready to embrace SQL Server's most powerful programming enhancement: turbocharged support for windowing functions. If you write analytical queries and you need results fast, attend this session to learn everything you need to know to leverage all the power that windowing functions bring to the table. You'll see examples taken from real-world projects that illustrate how to create running sums, calculate moving averages, look both backward and forward in your set, and achieve many other seemingly complex tasks -- all with ease and clarity. The hallmark of a truly great SQL Server feature is the ability to make difficult tasks simple. Windowing functions will have you writing better and faster T-SQL than ever before.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/adammachanic\">Adam Machanic<\/a><\/b> is a Boston-based SQL Server developer, writer, and speaker.

        "description": "<p>Welcome to the weekly BKBS Wednesday meet up. Please join us at 6:30 by the 3rd table station in the middle of the top roping \/ lead area. If you are still by the bouldering wall, keep on walking. Look for the beautiful, pasty white, blonde man with the green climbing shoes.<\/p> <p><br\/>BKBS is the gorgeous, new, state-of-the-art climbing gym most convenient to those in the Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville area. Although pricier, it features 60+ feet toproping and lead climbing, a massive 22 x 140 foot bouldering wall (and there's still another upstairs), yoga &amp; fitness classes, a sauna, awesome water fountains that fill your water bottle, a retail store, lounge area, weight room, and a soon to open cafe! There's even a collaborative work space where you can study, work, and climb!<\/p> <p><br\/>If you are looking for a partner or just want to get your climb on join us on Wednesdays for a fun time.<\/p> <p>FAQ:<\/p> <p><i>How do I get there?<\/i> BKBS is conveniently located within a 10 minute walk of the Porter Square station. Walk down Somerville Avenue and turn right on Properzi way and head all the way down. It is also very bike accessible. If you drive, you can find the lot at 30 Dane St. It is located next to Artisans Asylum.<\/p> <p><i>Why should I do this meetup?<\/i> Since BKBS is such a new community (opened in late July 2013) few people have developed regular climbing partners to train and climb with. This is a great opportunity to meet other climbers interested in BKBS. Climbing is an inherently social sport - to top rope and do lead, you need to meet people who are dedicated to climbing. The Wednesday meetup assures you'll meet a partner to regularly climb with. We are looking to expand to other nights in the future.<\/p> <p><i>What if I haven't climbed before?<\/i> First off, don't be intimidated. Everyone started somewhere. If you have never belayed before, please make sure to take the Learn the Ropes class. More info can be found here:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/.\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/<\/a>.<\/a>\u00a0If you have a working knowledge of how to belay, you will need to be belay certified before using the walls. Please flag down a BKBS employee and let them know you need to take a belay test. To pass such a test you will need to display how to tie a double figure eight knot with a fisherman's backup, safely belay a climber up a wall, catch them on a fall, and lower them to the ground safely.<\/p> <p><i>What equipment do I need?<\/i> You will need at the bare minimum a harness and climbing shoes. Rentals are available. Grigri devices are provided at every station.<\/p> <p><i>What if I can come, but at a different time?<\/i> Just let everyone know you want to climb at a different time and use the community to find a partner for those dates \/ times.<\/p> <p>These are the climbing rates:<\/p> <p>ADMISSION (Full day use, you can leave and come back!):<\/p> <p>Day Pass - $22 (Students $18)<br\/>10 Pack - $200 (Students $169)<\/p> <p>RENTALS:\u00a0<\/p> <p>Shoes - $5<br\/>Harness - $5<br\/>Chalk Bag - $2<br\/>Full Gear Kit - $11<\/p>",
        "how_to_find_us": "The third table in the middle of the climbing area between 6:30 - 6:40 - they've been moving the benches all around so it's now the 3rd \/ not the 4th. But it's always the one in the middle of the TR \/ Lead area.",

Here is <a href=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/9\/f\/e\/highres_16055326.jpeg\">a map of the area<\/a>.<\/p> <p>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that MTG Boston members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p>",

There are reasons for this. Politicians have disappointed us time and again; trusted institutions have proven to be self-serving and corrupt; hopes for lasting world peace repeatedly have been dashed; and social inequities persist and increase, unabated by even the grandest of charitable efforts. It is now considered foolish to think that people can be counted on to rise above their narrow self-interests to serve the broader good, or to tell the truth if it does not reflect well on the self. Supporting this bleak view of the human condition is a moral psychology that has taken increasingly cynical turns in recent years. Famous studies have shown that we have an almost unlimited potential for cruelty when placed in the wrong situations.<\/p> <p>The Power of Ideals presents a different vision, supported by a different kind of evidence. It examines the lives and work of six 20th century moral leaders who pursued moral causes ranging from world peace to social justice and human rights. Using these six cases to illustrate how people can make choices guided by their moral convictions, rather than by base emotion or social pressures, authors William Damon and Anne Colby explore the workings of three virtues: inner truthfulness, humility, and faith. Through their portrayal of the noble lives of moral leaders, the authors argue that all of us--with ordinary lives--can exercise control over important life decisions and pursue ideals that we believe in.<\/p> <p>Featured event books will be for sale at the event for 20% off.

        "description": "<p>When extracting herbs into alcohol or infusing them in water, we can only pull a fraction of the plant\u2019s constituents in either solvent. For many plants this suits our purposes fine, but some have both water- and alcohol-soluble constituents, and we\u2019d like to keep both in our finished medicines.<\/p> <p>Powdering is one of the best ways to preserve all the medicinal qualities of our plants, while also getting them into an easily-absorbed form. Taking a teaspoonful of dry powder, though, isn\u2019t a very appealing prospect!<\/p> <p>Come learn to make and use your own herbal powders \u2013 and how to blend them with nut butters, honey, and ghee to make tasty and healing edibles. Go beyond your standard Zoom Balls to nourishing, soothing, and vitalizing remedies. Put the power of powders to work for you!<\/p> <p>No prior experience necessary.

Likewise, if you're planning on arriving more than a half-hour late, you should be aware that it may not be possible to include you in a game. You're welcome to come by and hang out but the chances are better than even that we'll be hip-deep in gaming goodness by the time you arrive.<\/p> <p>* Please be respectful of our hosts; stay mindful of closing time and throw 'em some business if you're hungry.<\/p> <p>* Have fun and roll high!<\/p>",

How long did it take for employment levels to return to \u201cnormal\u201d in the Depression of 1920? The Great Depression? The Great Recession?<\/p> <p>2. What monetary and fiscal policy did Harding and his Fed chief pursue? How does this contrast with responses to the Great Depression and Great Recession? What does the Keynesian School advocate in response to downturns? The Chicago School? The Austrian School?<\/p> <p>3. What was happening to consumer prices when Harding took office? Why might this have been happening?<\/p> <p>4. What happened to consumer prices when Harding was in office? Why might this have happened? Did the change in prices take place primarily in asset\/capital or consumer prices?\u00a0<\/p> <p>5. If the Fed had pursued Milton Friedman\u2019s policy of keeping the money supply and price level stable, what would it have needed to do? Could the Fed have pursued Keynes\u2019 suggestions without taking the drastic step that is the answer to number one?<\/p> <p>6. What did the Fed chief call for in his speeches during the time?<\/p> <p>7. Was there a deflationary spiral that led to a total banking collapse during[masked]?<\/p> <p>8. A high savings rate led to a massive gold inflow and eventually boosted asset prices back up to pre-recession levels. Where did that capital go? What is the Austrian terminology for this? Is it the same as the mainstream terminology?<\/p> <p>9. When savings rates skyrocketed in 1920, the monetary base expanded as gold came in from around the world to take advantage of the high savings rate. How is this different from the expansion of the monetary base that took place in 2007?<\/p> <p>10. If the Fed just kept the monetary base constant and stopped engaging in QE, would this stop the boom\/bust cycle? Would it be an improvement?<\/p>",

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

Today, we call those artisans developers. Instead of metal, they use bits and bytes in the cloud to forge a modern application architecture that supports public, private and hybrid application deployment. One that enables users and developers to move their applications wherever they need to go. And it\u2019s built on a growing, vibrant ecosystem.<\/p> <p>Nowhere is this epic shift in how things are made more visible than the meteoric adoption of Cloud Foundry. In this talk, Cloud Foundry technology chief of staff Chip Childers will give attendees an inside look at the economic forces that have made Cloud Foundry the fastest growing open source project in history.<\/p> <p>He will also provide a look at the technologies driving this new level of efficiency for application developers (tech like containers, Docker, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Cloud Foundry and social coding tools like GitHub). And he\u2019ll explain why many prominent members of the Fortune 500 are building their futures on this modern application architecture.<\/p> <p>Speaker:\u00a0Chip Childers,\u00a0Technology Chief of Staff, Cloud Foundry\u00a0Foundation<\/p>",

The author of critically acclaimed books celebrating the life of her father shares personal reflections of the family's early years through excerpts from her books. She speaks about events that inspired his life's work, and tells how his voice, beliefs, and lessons were a vital part of her childhood and a powerful influence on who she has become.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Ilyasah Shabazz (pronounced Ill-yah-sah Shah-bozz) also is a civil rights activist, producer, and motivational speaker who lectures to capacity audiences across the country. For Growing Up X, a compelling and lyrical coming of age story co authored by Boston's Kim McLarin, she earned an NAACP Image Award nomination, as well as BET Best Book and United Press International Book of the Week picks.<\/p> <p>\u00a0In 2014, Shabazz released her first children\u2019s book Malcolm Little, The Boy Who Would Grow Up To Become Malcolm X (Simon and Schuster), beautifully illustrated and met with overwhelming response.\u00a0<\/p> <p>With the long awaited The Diary of Malcolm X (Third World Press), co-authored by Herb Boyd, Shabazz documents Malcolm X'sPilgramage to MECCA and his stay in Africa and the Middle East. It captures the ever evolving leader and thinker, his reflections, and his immense passions, and in many ways amplifies his autobiography.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Just released January, 2015, X: A Novel (Candlewick Press) -- co-written with the award-winning young adult author Kekla Magoon, who also co-authored Malcolm Little -- is a riveting and revealing book that follows the formative years of the man whose words and actions shook the world. Timed with the 50th \u00a0Anniversary of his death (February 21), \u201dX\u201d follows Malcolm from his childhood to his imprisonment for theft at age 20, when he found the faith that would lead him to forge a new path and command a voice that still resonates today.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Shabazz, who retraced her father\u2019s footsteps to the Holy City of Mecca, is included in the 500 Most Influential Muslims in the World.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>\"A universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience is not only possible but necessary. It is this experience toward which the course is directed.\" (ACIM Manual for Teachers)<\/p> <p>Designed to correct perception and lead to a universal experience of knowledge, A Course In Miracles has been translated into 23 languages, is referenced and utilized by many of today's most reknowned spiritual teachers, and has inspired countless books and curriculums based on its teachings. But it can be a difficult book to grasp. It is lengthy, the writing is abstract, and its use of Christian terminology alienates many.<\/p> <p>And yet it has become one of the most influential spiritual books of today.\u00a0Join us as we dive into it, and are led to understand its principles against the backdrop of our own personal experiences and insights.\u00a0Beginner as well as advanced Course students are welcome. We'll start with a short meditation, and then use a reading from the Course as an entry point into our\u00a0time\u00a0together. Cost $5 per person.<\/p> <p>Bringing a copy of the book is helpful, but not necessary. Recommended (but again not necessary) is the combined volume that includes the three supplements (Clarification of Terms; Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process, and Practice; The Song of Prayer), available online from The Foundation For Inner Peace at <a href=\"http:\/\/acim.org\">acim.org<\/a>.<\/p>",

Darcy Kuronen, Pappalardo Curator of Musical Instruments for the MFA and an internationally recognized authority on the history of musical instruments, has selected three carefully restored instruments from the 18th century for this very special event, including a German clavichord, French harpsichord, and English fortepiano. Don\u2019t miss this chance to travel back in time and let these instruments share their musical secrets with you.<\/p> <p>PART ONE: 10:30AM TO 12 NOON<br\/>ALEXANDER WEIMANN, harpsichord<br\/>featuring a 1736 French double-manual harpsichord by Henry Hemsch<\/p> <p>Exploration 1735<br\/>One of the most sought-after ensemble directors, soloists, and chamber music partners of his generation, Mr. Weimann can be heard on some 100 CDs. Centerpieces of his lecture\/demonstration recital will be Bach\u2019s French Ouverture BWV 831, Rameau\u2019s harpsichord arrangement of a suite from Les Indes galantes, and Handel\u2019s 6 Grand Fugues (HWV 605\u2013610), all compositions published within the year leading up to the most probable birth date of this famous instrument by German born and naturalized French harpsichord maker Henri Hemsch.<\/p> <p>PART TWO: 12:30PM TO 2PM<br\/>TOM BEGHIN, fortepiano<br\/>featuring a 1796 English grand piano by John Broadwood &amp; Son<\/p> <p>Theresa Jansen: Pupil, Dedicatee, and Composer<br\/>Renowned both as a groundbreaking scholar and brilliantly eloquent performer, fortepianist Tom Beghin has performed to acclaim around the world. His monumental recording project, The Virtual Haydn, has been hailed as a genuinely revolutionary artistic and technical accomplishment. For his BEMF d\u00e9but, Tom Beghin highlights the ambitious concert culture of 1790s London by celebrating one of its star pianists, Theresa Jansen, to whom Haydn and Clementi dedicated grand sonatas. These works, and her own compositions, are performed on a 1796 fortepiano from England\u2019s preeminent keyboard maker, John Broadwood &amp; Son.<\/p> <p>PART THREE: 2:30PM TO 4PM<br\/>LUC BEAUS\u00c9JOUR, clavichord<br\/>featuring a 1796 German Clavichord by Johann Christoph Georg Schiedmayer<\/p> <p>Canadian keyboard virtuoso Luc Beaus\u00e9jour has been hailed across North America and Europe for the elegance and expressiveness of his playing. Highlights of his recital, performed on one of the fewer than one dozen surviving clavichords by master builder Johann Christoph Georg Schiedmayer of Stuttgart, include Handel\u2019s Suite in D minor and Bach\u2019s French Suite No. 5 in G major, BWV 816.<\/p> <p>Alexander Weimann<\/p> <p>Tom Beghin<\/p> <p>Luc Beaus\u00e9jour<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>NUTSHELL - every week\u00a0day, 12:15ish until 1:45ish, Cumnock Turf Fields at Harvard Stadium, games of 4v4 up to 10v10 or larger depending on who shows, bring a white shirt and a dark\/colored shirt (but not a gray one), almost never canceled, read\u00a0below for more details before asking questions that are answered here, and read the comments for today's meetup to see if there is\u00a0anything important\u00a0about today.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\"><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT - Harvard Square is the closest T stop (red line). \u00a0Check Google Maps or other to find fastest way there from wherever you are.<\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY RIDE SHARE - a lot of players in this meetup come by car and are nice enough to offer rides to others. Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

This FREE Orientation class will get you familiar with how everything works at CBI. The orientation class is the gateway to everything that CBI has to offer, whether you\u2019re a seasoned sailor or brand new to boats. Done entirely on the dock, your orientation will include a guided tour of CBI\u2019s boats and facilities, an overview of our classes and programs, as well as plenty of time to ask the questions that matter to you as a sailor. All orientations meet at the base of the American Flag Pole out on the dock, and runs for about half an hour. All are welcome to this class!<\/p> <p><br\/>Afterwards, we invite you to meet one another and ask about other Orientation class attendees' prior experience with sailing. Perhaps you can find a friend to take the Beginner Sailing classes together with once you join.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Friday Nights are also when CBI members go out for Informal Racing, so it is an exciting night to watch the sailors and learn more about how you can progress your skills after learning to sail. Certainly ask your Orientation instructor about the Friday Night Informal Racing and Informal Instruction if he or she does not mention it.

Feel free to join for just dinner\/drinks, just the show, or both. RSVP to either or both here so we know how many to expect. For those going to the show, please purchase your tickets individually. Seating is general admission, so we'll all still be able to sit together.<\/p> <p>Let's discuss carpools\/designated drivers in the discussion thread here. It will probably make sense for us to set up some DDs for the evening who can park their car at Alewife or somewhere convenient.<\/p>",

A well attended venue for triathletes training for races of all distances.<\/p> <p>The gate opens at 7 a.m. and the Parking is right off of Walden St. Walden charges to park a their lot ($5) via a computerized parking attendant that takes cards. I'd recommend the annual pass if you think you're going to come to more meetups. Alternatively,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?saddr=Concord+High+School,+concord+ma&amp;daddr=915+Walden+Street,+Concord,+MA&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=38.93711,-75.966775&amp;sspn=13.846355,14.128418&amp;geocode=FRa1hwIdrlO_-yEidG069HujIg%3BFQqXhwIdjYW_-ylB1q82q5vjiTFsmsu3RKWVtQ&amp;gl=us&amp;mra=ls&amp;t=m&amp;z=16\">It's a short distance from Concord High School<\/a>.

We meet near the lifeguard house right on the beach closes to Walden street. Here is the map of walden pond.<\/p> <p>This meetup is important because you always want to swim in groups if you can. Make certain that you look out for each other. Don't attempt to swim across the pond if you haven't trained for that distance. Always match up with someone or a group that swims your pace. The beauty of Walden is that you can swim very close to shallow water and get some good open water training in.<\/p> <p>If there are people that are looking to go long for the first time, let me know in advance and I may be able to swim angel, or get a swim angel group together. That way we can do it in a controlled and safe environment.<\/p> <p>For those that are really new and nervous about open water swimming, stay tuned for a beginners clinic that I'll put on in the summer.<\/p>",

If anyone is interested afterwards, we can also walk the short but more challenging West Side Trail(about 20-25 min). \u00a0 Please be advised that parking has increased from $2 to $5 for residents, $6 for non-residents. :( The walk starts at 10:30 but will wait 10 minutes if there are late-comers.\u00a0 Please meet in front of the visitor's center.<\/p> <p>Directions<\/p> <p>Borderland is located approximately three miles from the center of Sharon, Mansfield and North Easton, Massachusetts; the park is twenty miles from Boston and thirty miles from Providence, RI.<\/p> <p>From north: Take Rte. 128 south to Rte. 95 south (towards Providence). Take exit 10 (Sharon, Walpole and Coney Street). Take a left at the end of the ramp and follow this road, two or three miles to the traffic lights in Sharon Center. Go straight thru this intersection and immediately bear right onto Pond St. Follow Pond St. for 1-1\/2 miles until you come to a traffic rotary. Go half way around the rotary and continue onto Massapoag Ave. for three miles to the park entrance, on your left.<\/p> <p>From Boston: Take the southeast expressway south to Rte. 128 north and then to Rte. 95 south. Follow directions from above.<\/p> <p>From West: Mass Pike to Rte. 495 south to exit 10 (Easton and Rte. 123). Take a left at the end of the ramp and follow Rte. 123 east towards Easton. Rte. 123 will merge with Rte. 106 east. After this merge look for the brown \"Borderland\" sign, on the left about a half mile from the merge. Take this left onto Poquanticut Ave. After about a mile the road will fork, bear to the left onto Massapoag Ave. and follow the signs to the park, approximately another two miles. Entrance will be on your right.<\/p>",

His method, L'Arte d'Armizare (the Art of Bearing Arms), shows an integrated and cross-referenced system of sword, dagger, grappling, spear &amp; lance, pollaxe and other weapons on foot and on horseback, with and without armour, and easily dispels any illusions that medieval combat was about unskilled strength.\u00a0 Armizare strikes to the gaps and the openings of your opponent's attacks, and supplements this with disarms, throws, and other techniques which secure the advantage over larger or stronger attackers.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our basic Foundational course will be taught by Deborah and Nelly, Armizare practitioners and teachers.\u00a0 These four linked classes give the basic techniques and vocabulary of L'Arte, and enable women to begin regular training and learning.\u00a0 No prior training needed; all class equipment is provided.<\/p> <p><br\/>Whether you're new to swordfighting or looking for a good excuse to come back, come and join the Armizare Amazons!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/c\/5\/600_435739397.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<i>(The price shown is for the set of all four classes (June 13, 20, 27, and July 11)\u00a0 and membership and registration.\u00a0 Classes are not offered separately.\u00a0 We'll send an email with some class materials before the first session.)<\/i><\/p>",

One part of what makes it so great is our weekly roof deck tour. Each and every Saturday we'll be visiting a different roof deck for food, drinks, relaxation, and socializing. Please the details carefully every week, as the details are going to change. Some venues have better times to visit than others, and as already stated, each week will be in a different location...<\/p> <p><b>Our Second Stop...<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/e\/5\/2\/highres_385327762.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The Rattlesnake opened its doors in the Back Bay in 1990, occupying the small second floor and roof deck at 384 Boylston Street. Within three years, The Rattlesnake was so popular that the owners expanded operations to occupy the first floor, more than doubling capacity.<\/p> <p>Today, Poe\u2019s Kitchen at The Rattlesnake is open seven days a week to serve lunch, dinner, and myriad specialty drinks. The outdoor roof deck is open to the public April through October (and when the weather cooperates during the rest of the year), accommodating 50 people with a full bar and menu available. New to the Rattlesnake is the street level outdoor patio.<\/p> <p>Join us on the roof deck to eat lunch, relax, and savor an experience like no other!<\/p> <p><b>On the menu:<\/b> Click here for\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/rattlesnakebarandgrill.com\/menus\/\">the menu<\/a>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/e\/2\/a\/highres_385327722.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>GETTING THERE<\/b><\/p> <p>Rattlesnake Bar is at 384 Boylston Street, Boston, 02116.<\/p> <p>Click here for <b>&lt;a&gt;directions on Google&lt;\/a&gt;<\/b>.

If you have pads this is probably the place to use them.<\/p> <p>Directions from nemba website: Get on I95 North. Take exit 44B for Lynn, Rt 129 East. This will dump you on a rotary, just continue to follow the signs for Rt 129 east. After you go about two more miles, a small road will go off to your right, which will be marked with a sign for the Larry Gannon Municipal Golf Course. Follow this road for about 200 yards until it dead ends into a parking lot with a baseball field on the side. This is the entrance to Lynn Woods. About 200 feet off the end of the parking lot will be the tail end of Walden Pond. To the left is the bulk of the reservation, including Dungeon Rock. To the right is the technical terrain that makes Lynn Woods awesome. Leave a lot of time and try both!<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Dear Fellow Bookclub Members,<\/p> <p>This is the 2nd place winner of our last poll. \u00a0Please see the title and the description below.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<i>Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment<\/i>\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>In spite of the double burden of racial and gender discrimination, African-American women have developed a rich intellectual tradition that is not widely known. In Black Feminist Thought, originally published in 1990, Patricia Hill Collins set out to explore the words and ideas of Black feminist intellectuals and writers, both within the academy and without. Here Collins provides an interpretive framework for the work of such prominent Black feminist thinkers as Angela Davis, bell hooks, Alice Walker, and Audre Lorde. Drawing from fiction, poetry, music and oral history, the result is a superbly crafted and revolutionary book that provided the first synthetic overview of Black feminist thought and its canon.<\/p>",

Please email [masked] before Friday 6\/12 at 10 am --when you are sure you are coming, EVEN IF YOU ALREADY checked RSVP on this Meetup site! You may also call and leave a message at[masked]\/9285<\/p> <p>Our speaker at 1:30 pm will be one of our members, Professor Mark Lindley, who has just returned from a year of teaching at several Indian Universities. Although he is currently focusing on the field of Ecological Economics, he is very well versed in Indian history and political thought. He is the author, with Lavanam, of the book \"Gandhi As We Knew Him\", which is now in its 2nd Edition. About a decade ago he taught for 2 years in Turkish Universities, so is knowledgeable about the Turkish Social and Political arena. Both the Indian and Turkish Constitutions are adamantly secular. Recent developments clearly indicate that serious encroachments are occurring as religions gain more political currency and intrude more deeply into the life of these two societies. Will these usurpations eventually become so pervasive\u00a0 that the secularity of these societies will be demolished? Mark will illuminate the situations for us.<\/p> <p><br\/>Please MARK YOUR CALENDARS for this traditional community event, which is open to all (RSVP via email or phone required however).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Celebrate the arrival of North American summer with us as we reach the solstice of another year!<\/p> <p>________<\/p> <p>Parking will be available in the Littauer Library Lot of Harvard University near the Science Center (Enter the Dworkin Science Quadrangle from Oxford St. and proceed to the end of the road to the parking area near the Science Center behind Littauer Library. If nervous, leave a note in your dashboard that you are at the Humanist event at PBH.)<\/p>",

Not all Onyx-birds will be traveling at the same time, so there is flexibility to join during a portion or the entire time frame as your budget and vacation time allows.<\/p> <p>To date, there are five confirmed travelers who have purchased round trip air fare:<\/p> <p>Daphne, Tonya, Kenya, Crye and TChad<\/p> <p>These members purchased round-trip fares from Boston to Singapore with an extended (18 hour) lay-over in Hong Kong on the return flight to Boston. For travelers and potential travelers that are interested in extending your stay in Hong Kong via the layover, it is easy and affordable. I was able to contact my air carrier, Cathay Pacific, and extend my stay in Hong Kong by two days for only $100 USD.<\/p> <p>Thornton highly recommends including\/extending your stay in this world class city of the orient as it will be well worth your while.<\/p> <p>There are other destinations within the region that members have expressed interest in visiting. Bali appears to be topping the regional excursion list; and with Bali being a quick 2.5 hour flight from Singapore, it\u2019s easy to see why. A full-list of excursions members plan to take are:<\/p> <p>Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) - Tonya<br\/>Manila \u2013 Tonya<br\/>Shanghai - Tonya<br\/>Bali \u2013 Daphne, Thornton, TChad<br\/>Hong Kong \u2013 Daphne, Tonya, Kenya, Cyre, TChad, Thornton.<\/p> <p>As interest and confirmed travelers continue to grow for this excursion, so will the itinerary. Members have already expressed interest in:<\/p> <p>Dance classes<\/p> <p>Food Classes<\/p> <p>Walking cultural tour (Viator)<\/p> <p>Tai Chi\/QiGong<\/p> <p>Night Life and exploring Sentosa Island in Singapore<\/p> <p>Our next meeting will focus on a central location for lodging, room sharing, excursions (who\/what\/when\/where\/how) and associated costs\/budget.<\/p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you all at the next meeting!<\/p> <p>Daphne<\/p>",

Come in contact with your Source of life and power. The active stage of the meditation is followed by a silent stage, in which you bask in a vast field of peace and relaxation. The silence you experience after working with breath is profound and clear. Through this process you will experience renewed aliveness and freedom.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/d\/0\/5\/600_435203813.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nEach Chakra stores the collection of our core beliefs, emotions and experiences in correlation to seven fundamental themes in our life: survival, creativity, power, love, self-expression, wisdom, and divine connection.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Through this dynamic meditation you will:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>\n\u2666 De-Stress!<\/p> <p><br\/>\n\u2666 Revitalize!<\/p> <p><br\/>\n\u2666 Embody your Personal Power! \n<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2666 Clear and balance each vital energy center<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2666 Strengthen your immune system \n<\/p> <p>\u2666 Harness your power of manifestation\n<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2666 Feel energized, relaxed and happy<\/p> <p><br\/>\n\u2666 Experience deep relaxation and peace \n<\/p> <p><br\/><i>No previous experience necessary.

They aren't complex, and there won't be any instant replays for controversial calls.<\/p> <p>It's designed to be fun, playful, and casual.

Music is played for Standard and Smooth styles such as waltz, foxtrot, and tango as well as Latin and Rhythm styles including salsa, rumba, cha-cha, and the like. At Star Dance School Socials an optional 30 minute group dance lesson kicks off the evening as well!<\/p> <p>What on earth should I wear?!<br\/>Smart-casual to elegant attire is encouraged, but most importantly wear clothing you can move around in comfortably. If you do not have ballroom shoes often a light weight dress shoe will do the trick. *Note: Please avoid sneakers or metal spike-heel shoes as they can damage our floor. Thank you for your understanding!*<\/p> <p>Do I need a partner?<br\/>Partners are welcome, but not required to enjoy a night out on the town with us! Social dancing is a fantastic way to make new friends and we encourage dancers to rotate partners in order to meet new people.<\/p> <p>Do I need prior dance experience?<br\/>Whether it is your first time dancing or you have years of ballroom under your belt, all levels are welcome to attend our socials!<\/p>",

HPSP is a an old quarry, which makes for a good foreground.<\/p> <p><br\/>We will *briefly* review settings, shooting options and approaches, but if you have not done much Milky Way shooting, it is highly recommended that you attend the free lecture scheduled for earlier this month. Preference will be given for attendees of that workshop.<\/p> <p><br\/>Sunset is 8:22, but it doesn't get dark until 9, hence. the late meetup time. The Milky Way will come over the horizon at that time, but best shooting will be between 10 and midnight or later, so this is a late night event. The moon will be out of the way all night. Bring a sleeping bag \/ mat, hot and cold drinks, snacks and bug spray.<\/p> <p><br\/>Important: please bring a<b> DIM<\/b> light to check your settings. Please do <b>NOT<\/b> use large or bright flashlights, I will give you a hard time if you do. The human eye needs 30 minutes to adjust to darkness. Every time you use a flashlight, you will blind yourself and, more importantly, blind others and show up in other people's shots. This is important, please use a star gazer approach.

You can set it to be very dim (press and hold until it JUST comes on) or full fledged red light.

But Mabel Cabot Sedgwick, an accomplished gardener and horticulturist, had more ambitious \u2013 and aesthetic \u2013 ideas. As the couple formulated plans for the elegant Federal-style home that would become their summer retreat, Mabel Sedgwick also set about designing gardens and landscape amenities that are renowned a century later. After her death in 1937, her vision was sustained and expanded by the second Mrs. Sedgwick, the former Marjorie Russell, a rare plants specialist, who added new and rare species of trees and shrubs to the estate, some introduced by the Arnold Arboretum in Jamaica Plain.<\/p> <p>The gardens are laid out in a series of separate garden \u201crooms\u201d surrounding the handsome, Federal-style, brick house. Each \u201croom\u201d is distinct in its own way, accented by ornaments and statuary. Today, the gardens retain the \u201cGarden for Living\u201d\u2013style with integrated outdoor rooms, mature plantings that blend into the surrounding woodlands, and a spirit of innovation in horticulture.<\/p> <p>The gardens are flanked on all sides by more than 100 acres of woodland as well as an apple orchard, meadow, children\u2019s garden, and agricultural fields, including a 2-acre organic vegetable farm run by The Food Project as a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) project.<\/p> <p><br\/>A popular 1.2-mile main loop trail \u2013 great for families \u2013 passes through quintessentially New England woodlands dotted by vernal pools and imposing boulders.<\/p> <p><br\/>We will start our walk at 10:00, so if you are running late, please catch up!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Directions<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>From Rt. 128 Exit 18, take Rt. 22 North 1 mi.

You can take your bike on the MBTA Red Line on weekends.<\/p> <p>This is a friendship tournament format, meaning call your own faults, as there are no referees.<\/p> <p>The organizers for these events will be Matt BenDaniel and Brian Lee.<\/p> <p>We will be using the ruleset listed in the first post on the following: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/volleyball-122\/messages\/boards\/thread\/8548572?thread=8548572\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/volleyball-122\/messages\/boards\/thread\/8548572?thread=8548572\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/volleyball-122\/messages\/boards\/thread\/8548572?thread=8548572<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>The event will start at 10:30 AM and will likely last at least until mid afternoon (~3:30 PM). If you would like to play in this event you must commit to staying at least through the end of pool play. Remember to bring snacks\/food and water\/beverages, as this event will involve a significant amount of volleyball play.<\/p> <p>This event is intended for players with experience playing reverse coed doubles format. To sign up for this event, send an email to Brian using the following link on meetup:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/volleyball-122\/message\/?recipientId=4774008&amp;subject=6\/14-RCO\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/volleyball-122\/message\/?recipientId=4774008&amp;subject=6\/14-RCO<\/a><\/p> <p>In the email, provide the following information:<\/p> <p>* Name<br\/>* Gender<br\/>* Unless we already know you well, please include a detailed description of your reverse coed doubles experience. It is *your* responsibility to truthfully convince us you have the skillz. If you're a beginner to doubles, you should check out other tournaments which offer B\/BB level.<br\/>* Confirm that you have read the ruleset at the link above and that you agree to play by those rules.<br\/>* Confirm that you can commit to play from 10:30 AM to 3:30 PM.<br\/>* Signup partner name (if you have a signup partner)<\/p> <p>Preferably, each player in a signup pair should send an email.<\/p> <p>For this event we will aim to have player numbers in a multiple of four so that there are no sitouts for players. Preference is given to AA\/A players who sign up in male\/female pairs. Single signups will initially be placed into the event to as needed to achieve gender balance, although if there is a lack of signups near to the event date we will allow gender imbalance in the roster. Note that sending an email does not guarantee a spot to play; spots are only guaranteed if you are added to the event page.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Hey all!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nI've gotten ALOT of inquiries about Adult level classes, as most of the public classes posted here are geared towards kids 6-18. Most of the adult level classes we run are normally through private clinics or classes and I'd really like to get any\/everybody involved and moving.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I'm thinking to run these Sundays at 11 AM, but if we as a group can figure out a better\/more accessible time I'd love to hear it. I just assume most people have work off, parking is free and the city is a bit less congested than normal.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Onto the class specifics...<\/p> <p><b>What if I've never done anything like Parkour before?\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>This class, Parkour 101, is a introductory level class. We will be focusing more on learning how to move our body, understand our limits and get a solid understanding of how to train safe rather than jumping straight into super-high level flips and jumps.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What if I'm a gymnast\/marine\/stuntman\/etc? I don't want to be bored.<\/b><\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement. It's very common to in the same class have one student working on perfecting their roll, and on the other side of the room have another student practicing very high-level acrobatics. They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/b><\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous. We accept cash or card day of.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Anything else?<\/b><\/p> <p>These jams will be run outdoors, and with existing architecture. While we won't be getting into anything crazy, injuries are to be expected. Scrapes happen. We will have first aid available, but make sure you are thinking clearly and in your limits before training!\u00a0<\/p> <p>I am available to answer all questions, but I hope to see a whole bunch of you out in a few weeks!!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Be sure to check us out on:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\"><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/<\/a>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/7\/5\/600_437965461.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>This is the new, regular meetup on Sundays at noon at Brooklyn Boulders in Somerville. Look for the dark-haired guy with glasses and yellow Katana climbing shoes who keeps falling off the bouldering wall. I'll have my stuff on the first table\/bench thing by the entrance. I primarily boulder, but hopefully we'll get a good variety of climbing interests coming so that everyone can follow their climbing passion!<\/p> <p>(Credit to Francesco Cardiello for the information below):<br\/>BKBS is the gorgeous, new, state-of-the-art climbing gym most convenient to those in the Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville area. Although pricier, it features 60+ feet toproping and lead climbing, a massive 22 x 140 foot bouldering wall (and there's still another upstairs), yoga &amp; fitness classes, a sauna, awesome water fountains that fill your water bottle, a retail store, lounge area, weight room, and a soon to open cafe! There's even a collaborative work space where you can study, work, and climb!<br\/>If you are looking for a partner or just want to get your climb on join us on Wednesdays for a fun time.<\/p> <p>FAQ:<\/p> <p>How do I get there? BKBS is conveniently located within a 10 minute walk of the Porter Square station. Walk down Somerville Avenue and turn right on Properzi way and head all the way down. It is also very bike accessible. If you drive, you can find the lot at 30 Dane St. It is located next to Artisans Asylum.<\/p> <p>Why should I do this meetup? Since BKBS is such a new community (opened in late July 2013) few people have developed regular climbing partners to train and climb with. This is a great opportunity to meet other climbers interested in BKBS. Climbing is an inherently social sport - to top rope and do lead, you need to meet people who are dedicated to climbing. The Wednesday meetup assures you'll meet a partner to regularly climb with. We are looking to expand to other nights in the future.<\/p> <p>What if I haven't climbed before? First off, don't be intimidated. Everyone started somewhere. If you have never belayed before, please make sure to take the Learn the Ropes class. More info can be found here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/<\/a>. If you have a working knowledge of how to belay, you will need to be belay certified before using the walls. Please flag down a BKBS employee and let them know you need to take a belay test. To pass such a test you will need to display how to tie a double figure eight knot with a fisherman's backup, safely belay a climber up a wall, catch them on a fall, and lower them to the ground safely.<\/p> <p>What equipment do I need? You will need at the bare minimum a harness and climbing shoes. Rentals are available. Grigri devices are provided at every station.<\/p> <p>What if I can come, but at a different time? Just let everyone know you want to climb at a different time and use the community to find a partner for those dates \/ times.<\/p> <p>These are the climbing rates:<\/p> <p>ADMISSION (Full day use, you can leave and come back!): Day Pass - $22 (Students $18)<br\/>10 Pack - $200 (Students $169)<\/p> <p>RENTALS: Shoes - $5<br\/>Harness - $5<br\/>Chalk Bag - $2<br\/>Full Gear Kit - $11<\/p>",

I'm setting up two different meetups so you can choose one or both.<\/p> <p>Description of the film, from the MFA website:<\/p> <p>Andersson\u2019s first feature was a great critical and popular success in his home country. With the gorgeous Swedish summer as a backdrop, the film portrays the pure love that arises between the daughter of a refrigerator salesman and the son of a car mechanic, offering a glimpse into the lives and homes of the people of the Swedish Social Democracy during its heyday. Andersson\u2019s debut is a typically stirring m\u00e9lange of comedy and melancholy, the quotidian and the absurd.<\/p>",

So if you are nervous about meeting someone for the first time in their home, then I recommend you join us for our first Meet and Greet event and then pick and choose your future events from there.<\/p> <p>Some of our events will include, but are not limited to\u2026<br\/>\u2022 Cosplay Brainstorming<br\/>\u2022 Group Cosplay viewings<br\/>\u2022 Supply Hunts aka trips to Goodwill, thrift stores, and fabric stores<br\/>\u2022 Sewing days<br\/>\u2022 And more\u2026<\/p> <p><b>I like the idea but I\u2019ve never cosplayed before...<\/b><\/p> <p>It takes a lot of courage to put on a costume and attend conventions, or parties, or to go to the grocery store. I, Wendy, speak from experience. The first time I cosplayed I was in my 30\u2019s and had to walk through a very large crowd of \u201cnormal people\u201d (I use that team jokingly of course. We are all normal. Well\u2026 I\u2019m mostly normal\u2026 lol) A few years later, I was so comfortable cosplaying, that it wasn\u2019t unusual for you to see me grocery shopping with Zombie make-up on my arm or buying cleaning supplies while wearing a Lolita maid cosplay (purely coincidental I assure you, but very ironic). This is a judgment free zone, so please feel comfortable that you are among friends.<\/p> <p><b>What is the cost?<\/b><\/p> <p>There is no cost to attend Cosplay Creation events; however, depending on the activity, you are responsible for your own purchases and supplying your own materials for any cosplay you wish to create.<\/p> <p><b>Directions \/ Transportation<\/b><\/p> <p>We will organize carpools from Boston where possible; however, most events will be train or bus accessible. Each event will list how to get there and will give members a chance to organize any carpool that may be needed.<\/p> <p>Our first event is in the courtyard of the Boston Public Library located in Copley Square. This is accessible via the green line. There are also parking garages in Boston and free street parking on Sundays. Just be aware that many side streets in Boston require a resident permit, so please use caution when parking.<\/p>",

People please bring things such as cheese and crackers, fruit, wine, cake, cookies, etc.<\/p> <p><br\/>We will be at the field at 1:30 pm and we will try to secure a spot on the shaded side of field right hand side of the bleachers. Please park in parking lot and walk over to our area on far side of the field, we will have banners up as to where we will all be sitting.<\/p> <p>This is a casual event and shorts are fine however many folks dress up and hats, sundresses etc is encouraged.<\/p> <p>If everyone could bring a dish to share\u00a0and drinks that would be great. Please bring your own chair or blanket. Also if you have a table that would help.<\/p> <p>Anyone who has not spoken to me is asked to park in the parking lot and not on the field. This is a popular event and we usually have over 50 attending so I can\u2019t have 50 cars on the field.

It was founded in 1882 by J. Murray Forbes. The name \u201cMyopia\u201d is due to some of its founding members having come from the Myopia Club in Winchester, Massachusetts, which had been founded by four brothers with poor vision, or myopic. Today, the Myopia Hunt Club is a drag hunt, meaning that the hounds follow a laid scent rather than live fox.<\/p> <p>Myopia also boasts one of the oldest continually running polo fields in the nation. Gibney Field, formerly used as a pasture, was mowed and used for practice in the summer of 1888. That fall, Myopia held its first official match against the Dedham Polo and Country Club. In 1890, Myopia became one of seven charter members of the Polo Association, now the United States Polo Association. Of those seven original clubs, Myopia is one of two still in existence (Meadowbrook on Long Island is the other.) It is the only one that still uses its original field.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.myopiapolo.org%2F&amp;h=UAQHG74Xl&amp;enc=AZPU1y3zMMAuHs3EX5wRfFzL1TzbVntkEc9UhtFeESjgCPO2NJ4XCSHdJkCbu8P5gZw&amp;s=1\">www.myopiapolo.org<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/6\/2\/9\/600_437994825.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Event Sponsors <\/b><br\/>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013<br\/><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thcsociety\">Cannabis Society<\/a> <\/b><br\/>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013<br\/>The Cannabis Society is the 1st country club in America dedicated to creating events around marijuana\u2019s multiple uses.

The reason is so that your trees can be evaluated and advice obtained on how to make improvements prior to the fair. So please bring your trees whether they are show ready or not for advice on how to get them ready. Remember there are cash prizes($15 for 1st, $10 for 2nd &amp; $8 for 3rd),ribbons as well as the club trophy up for grabs. There is a novice class(if you've never entered or won a blue ribbon before),plus 4 different sizes to enter and the saikei(landscape or seascape usually with rocks)class. So bring your different size trees to prepare. You either should have done all the work on a tree to enter it, or have worked it for at least 2 years. ALL members should endeavor to enter at least one tree in the fair. So please support the club by preparing and entering your best tree(s)! We usually have everyone who wants to, talk about their trees. How they've obtained them, the work they've done so far and what their goals are. Normally, I'd tell you how I look forward to seeing you all there, but, unfortunately I'll be away that week. There also is a good chance for a special surprise at this meeting. So please be sure to attend.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Ah, summer: the time of new possibility, of walks in the woods and commencement ceremonies encouraging us to dream big and nourish our spirits. In one of the most famous commencement speeches of all time, Ralph Waldo Emerson's 1838 Harvard Divinity School address, Emerson urged graduates to transcend their reality, to \"go alone,\" rather than following religious dogma. As a community of atheists, agnostics and allies, we tend to agree with Emerson about dogma, but what about 'going alone'?<\/p> <p>In a brief talk and longer discussion (including small breakout groups), Greg will take the beginning of what many call the \"most spiritual season\" as an opportunity to explore the relationship between humanism and spirituality. Should humanism be spiritual? In what ways? Hint: when Don Draper went to the famous Esalen Institute at the end of TV's \"Mad Men\", he wasn\u2019t just seeking his navel. He went to a place informed by humanistic psychology, where a higher priority was placed on human connection and community than on \"transcendence\". What would such a place look like here in Boston, in the 21st century, under the summer sun?<\/p>",

Please pay the organizer when you arrive before the meetup starts. The money goes to cover the cost of the court rental. The entrance to the gym is on Cambridge Street opposite Harvard Market. The nearest intersection to the entrance is Cambridge Street and Roberts Road. The nearest T stop is Harvard Square. The gym is about a ten minute walk from the T stop. Parking near the school on Sundays is generally easy to find, as meters and residential parking rules are generally not enforced on Sundays (parking signs should say \"EX SUNDAY\" or similar).<\/p>",

If nothing else, this title guarantees that you will have quite an interesting description of your afternoon to tell to others.<\/p> <p>Description of the film, from the MFA's website (this is also the most recent of Andersson's films):<br\/>Like his previous features, Songs from the Second Floor and You, the Living, master Swedish director Roy Andersson takes up the theme of \u201cbeing a human being\u201d with this meticulously crafted, dreamlike black comedy. Sam and Jonathan, a pair of hapless novelty salesman, take us on a kaleidoscopic tour of the human condition in reality and fantasy, unfolding in absurdist episodes: a sing-along at a 1940s beer hall, an encounter with a randy flamenco teacher, the thirsty King Charles XII of Sweden en route to battle, and a diabolical metaphor for the horrors inflicted by European colonialism. It is a journey that unveils the beauty of single moments, the pettiness of others, life\u2019s grandeur, and the humor and tragedy hidden within us all.<\/p>",

Its exploration of the abuse of power, the drive of lust, and the triumph of love is as relevant and intriguing today as it was over three and a half centuries ago, and shows Monteverdi at the height of his powers. The smoldering center of this masterpiece is the Roman Emperor Nero\u2019s obsessive love for the beautiful Poppea, which is brought to life by Australian countertenor David Hansen as Nerone and American soprano Amanda Forsythe as Poppea. BEMF\u2019s four-time Grammy-nominated directors lead a revival of the critically acclaimed 2009 production of this extraordinary work.<\/p> <p>\"[An] exquistely staged, deeply moving production.\" -The New York Times<\/p> <p>Video<\/p> <p>Amanda Forsythe in BEMF's 2013 production of Handel's Almira.<\/p> <p>David Hansen performs Handel's \"Yet, can I hear that dulcet lay\" at the Ris\u00f8r kammermusikkfest, 2011.<\/p> <p>Artists<\/p> <p>Paul O'Dette &amp; Stephen Stubbs, Musical Directors<br\/>Gilbert Blin, Stage Director<br\/>Robert Mealy, Concertmaster<\/p> <p>Ellen Hargis, Assistant Stage Director<br\/>Anna Watkins, Costume Designer and Supervisor<br\/>Gilbert Blin, Set Designer<br\/>Lenore Doxsee, Lighting Designer<br\/>Kathleen Fay, Executive Producer<br\/>CAST<br\/>Amanda Forsythe, Poppea<br\/>David Hansen, Nerone<br\/>Shannon Mercer, Ottavia<br\/>Nathan Medley, Ottone<br\/>Teresa Wakim, Drusilla<br\/>Christian Immler, Seneca<br\/>Laura Pudwell, Arnalta<br\/>Zachary Wilder, Lucano<br\/>Nell Snaidas, Amore &amp; Valletto<br\/>Jose Lemos, Nutrice<br\/>Aaron Sheehan, Liberto<br\/>Erica Schuller, La Fortuna &amp; Damigella<br\/>Marco Bussi, Littore<br\/>Danielle Reutter-Harrah, La Virt\u00f9 &amp; Pallade<br\/>John Taylor Ward, Mercurio<br\/>BEMF Chamber Ensemble<br\/>Robert Mealy &amp; Julie Andrijeski, violin; Laura Jeppesen, viola; Phoebe Carrai, violoncello; Robert Nairn, double bass; Paul O\u2019Dette &amp; Stephen Stubbs, chitarrone &amp; Baroque guitar; Maxine Eilander, Baroque harp; Alessandro Quarta, Michael Sponseller &amp; Avi Stein, harpsichord &amp; organ; David Morris, viola da gamba; Erin Headley, viola da gamba &amp; lirone<\/p>",

PLEASE look on the website each week for confirmation. THANKS!<\/p> <p><br\/>To get to the Meetup, take the RED LINE stop OUTBOUND TO ALEWIFE, and stop at PORTER SQ. Look down the street. There's Tavern in the Square! If you're driving, you can park on the street for free on Sundays!<\/p> <p>Anyone who loves ASL is welcome to come and be part of the fun! We want to warmly extend an invitation to Deaf people or others fluent\/skilled in the language (CODAs for example) to join our group.<\/p> <p>This is an easy-going, casual, ASL get-together to meet people who enjoy American Sign Language, who want to brush up on their signing skills, and want to learn more ASL by using it as often as possible.<\/p> <p>We strive to have a good time and communicate without using voices. If we need to, we draw or write what we don't know how to sign, and if lots of folks show up, we split up into small groups and mix and mingle, so we can actually see one another clearly, face-to-face and get a good conversation going.<\/p> <p>Don't be afraid or shy if you're not \"perfect\" at ASL, because being \"perfect\" is not the point of this group. No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.<\/p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again. This isn't an ASL class, since none of us are certified ASL teachers, so there's really <i>no<\/i> pressure or expectation--other than that we all use ASL to communicate. We all learn from one another!<\/p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL\/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language<\/i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs<\/i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!<\/p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged<\/i><\/b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating. We have lots of resources that we can suggest for learning ASL from a qualified teacher or authentic source, such as books, online classes, and local classes at various locations near Boston.<\/p> <p>If you can, \"officially\" RSVP, even if the RSVP is \"No,\" so that we know who is definitely going to come.<\/p> <p>It will be great to see folks!<\/p> <p>Erika and Jack<\/p>",

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup. Therefore the number of RSVPs reflected here are NOT the total number of men or women registered.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

        "description": "<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This is an ongoing weekly class for anyone, offering experiential practice in meditation, along with an opportunity to be among others interested in deepening spiritutual practices. \u00a0The class provides you with a felt sense of your own divinity; your Higher Self. The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening. Bringing the flow of light into the body\/mind\/heart means we more consciously embody our Light Being, so we are more present, happy, forgiving, peaceful and joyful while in the world.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0After the guided portion we\u00a0spend time\u00a0in peaceful silence.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you are an experienced meditator or a beginner, you will love the sweetness and powerful energies of this group. At the end of the class we make time for questions or sharing. \u00a0Group meditation is powerful, and it's refreshing to be among fellow travelers!<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0Judy also teaches the Sound and Light meditation; a way for you to draw your senses inward to open your spiritual eye and to hear the sounds of your chakras.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0This practice is non-denominational, appropriate for anyone.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0Held in a lovely healing space, just walking in will bring you instant peace.\u00a0 All are welcome.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0 You may also want to check out my other Meetup, for a variety of spiritual programs: \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings<\/a><\/a>\/<\/p>",

Rather than having another book talk, Miranda has decided to practice what she preaches and make something. Or rather, play something.<\/p> <p>A practicing musician, Miranda was trained in classical piano for twelve years before jumping ship to start writing folk songs on guitar. Since January 2014, she has uploaded a new song to Youtube every month as an attempt to keep the music coming despite an increasingly busy schedule. (You can see some here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL-ag5FeGVRb8GT7Dc7_gluK2hasRZFWbj\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL-ag5FeGVRb8GT7Dc7_gluK2hasRZFWbj<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Although she has performed as the feature at Open Mics and Farmer's Markets, Miranda has never taken the plunge to be the main feature of an event. At least, not musically. But what better place to do it than at the Hearth?<\/p> <p>So mark your calendars and join us for Hearth Founder Miranda Aisling's first real concert. As always, we will have a potluck and a jam session after the feature. If you bring a dish to the potluck you can get in for free!<\/p> <p>Tickets are $7 or get a ticket and a copy of the Sketchbook Edition of Don't Make Art, Just Make Something for $20.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>No contemporary filmmaker has chronicled the messy human experience with the eye and ear of a comedic cultural anthropologist like Judd Apatow. Hits as varied as those he\u2019s directed, like Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and those he\u2019s produced, like Superbad and Bridesmaids, are all unified by their honest, unflinching, comic look at how complicated it is to grow up in the modern world. Apatow has also built a history of helping break distinctive new comedy voices into the mainstream, from Seth Rogen to Lena Dunham among many others. Now, in his fifth feature film as a director, Apatow again brings a portrait of an unforgettable character, and a portrayal by a breakout new comedy star, together in Trainwreck, written by and starring Amy Schumer (Inside Amy Schumer) as a woman who lives her life without apologies, even when maybe she should apologize. Since she was a little girl, it\u2019s been drilled into Amy\u2019s (Schumer) head by her rascal of a dad (Colin Quinn) that monogamy isn\u2019t realistic. Now a magazine writer, Amy lives by that credo\u2014enjoying what she feels is an uninhibited life free from stifling, boring romantic commitment\u2014but in actuality, she\u2019s kind of in a rut. When she finds herself starting to fall for the subject of the new article she\u2019s writing, a charming and successful sports doctor named Aaron Conners (Bill Hader), Amy starts to wonder if other grown-ups, including this guy who really seems to like her, might be on to something. The comedy, from a script written by Schumer, co-stars Brie Larson, John Cena, Tilda Swinton and LeBron James. Apatow produces Trainwreck through his Apatow Productions alongside Barry Mendel (Bridesmaids, This Is 4<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/2MxnhBPoIx4\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/2MxnhBPoIx4<\/a><\/p>",

She insisted that symbiosis was as important to understanding evolution as natural selection. Her descriptions of microbial communities in her many books gave me great insight when developing biodiverse living systems to treat chemical wastewater. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Having this microbial perspective has allowed Jim Laurie to understand why John Todd's \"Living Machines\" were\u00a0successful and Allan Savory's \"Holistic Planned Grazing\" could restore grasslands to their former richness.\u00a0She is credited with developing the theory of endosymbiosis, also known as symbiogenesis, which explains how complex eukaryotic cells evolved by a fusion of simpler prokaryotic (bacterial) cells.\u00a0Creating good habitats for microbial communities is critical in all ecosystems as we are now seeing in forests, wetlands, grasslands, and even in our gut. A healthy microbiome in our intestines is a big part of our human immune system.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Margulis enrolled at the University of Chicago at 14 years of age. She was on the faculties of Boston University for two decades before she went to UMass - Amherst in 1988.\u00a0Using her more holistic view of the evolution of life on earth, she saw much value in Lovelock's Gaia Hypothesis and researched how the biodiversity of life can regulate components of earth's atmosphere, ocean salinity, and planetary temperature.<\/p> <p>Learning what Lynn Margulis can teach us about symbiosis will give us great insight as\u00a0we endeavor to create a future where humanity can thrive by restoring biodiverse\u00a0ecosystems everywhere.\u00a0<\/p>",

She chances on a rancher, George Bliss, who is willing to hire her on. Many of his regular hands are off fighting the war, and he glimpses, beneath her showy rodeo garb, a shy but strong-willed girl with a serious knowledge of horses. So begins the irresistible tale of a young but determined woman trying to make a go of it in a man's world. Over the course of several long, hard winter months, many of the townsfolk witness Martha talking in low, sweet tones to horses believed beyond repair -- and getting miraculous, almost immediate results. Ultimately, her gifts will earn her a place of respect in the community.With an elegant sweetness like that found in Plainsong, and a winning energy as in Water for Elephants, The Hearts of Horses delivers a heartwarming, greatly satisfying story about the unexpected and profound connections between people and animals.In the winter of 1917, nineteen-year-old Martha Lessen saddles her horses and heads for a remote county in eastern Oregon, looking for work \"gentling\" wild horses.

How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection.

They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup. Therefore the number of RSVPs reflected here are NOT the total number of men or women registered.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

While in this state the\u00a0sound waves of the gong and bowls induce an extended state of effortless meditation\u00a0and relaxation that facilitates the movement of prana through the body and psyche for\u00a0healing. In this way, the gong is a tool that magnifies and focuses the power of the\u00a0yoga experience. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>We will finish with tea, treats, and joy!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please bring a thick blanket or cushion to lie on and a shawl to cover with!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cThe Gong is the first and last instrument for the human mind, there is only one thing\u00a0that can supersede and command the human mind, the sound of the Gong. It is the first sound in the\u00a0Universe, the sound that created the Universe. It\u2019s the basic creative sound. To the mind, the sound of\u00a0the gong is like a mother and father that gave it birth. The mind has no power to resist a gong that is\u00a0well played.\u201d \u00a0-Yogi Bhajan, Master of Kundalini Yoga<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Yoga &amp; Gong: Guruatma Kaur: An IKYTA certified teacher and devoted student of Yogi Bhajan,\u00a0Guruatma Kaur has been enthusiastically teaching Kundalini Yoga since 1979. She is lovingly\u00a0dedicated to encouraging clarity, excellence, and relaxation into one\u2019s True Self.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Gong:\u00a0 Dharam Singh began an exploration of sound as a saxophonist and flutist in the Bronx, NYC - an environment immersed in the rich music and culture of Africa by way of the Caribbean, Boriqua, African American and the counter culture, which gave him a multicultural perspective on musical language. \u00a0 His passion for the transformative power of sound and music has found a place in the use of the Gong as he came to develop a unifying aural language that removes the separation between Head and Heart, Body and Soul. It is these frequencies, tones and harmonics, already given by Nature that he simply lives to share.\u00a0 Dharam is a long time student of Yogi Bhajan and a resident of Guru Ram Das Ashram, where he is the go-to guy for anything related to Gong Yoga, including buying one -\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.gongsongs.com\/\">www.gongsongs.com<\/a> He is part of the 'three-some' that leads the monthly Full Moon Gong event\u00a0<\/p> <p>Meditation: Siri Tapa Kaur, a Reiki Master, Sat Nam Rasayan Practitioner, and\u00a0certified Kundalini Yoga Teacher lives a life committed to being healthy, happy, and available to\u00a0all.

        "description": "<p>This is a friendly monthly reminder to contribute $11 yearly to help us pay off the yearly Meetup Group fee and additional cost to run the group and keep the group going. This is more for member's information and is not meant to sound that I am angry. Also, note that\u00a0 Biagio is NOT getting rich from the group fees.\u00a0 This is a YEARLY fee and NOT a monthly fee.<\/p> <p>I wanted to address any crazy rumors and incorrect assumptions that I am getting rich from Meetup. These assumptions are based on having ALL 9,000 members paying the $10 a member fee which would equal $90,000, but that is 100% incorrect. I am not making $90,000 a year for this group!<\/p> <p>So please let me clarify less than 1% of the group\u2019 members actually pay the $11 yearly Voluntarily Donation. Out of that $11 PayPal take their cut so I only get \u00a0$10 per member. I barley take in $200 a year and that is NOT enough cover the yearly Meetup fees and the other Meetup expense like printing out Meetup materials, supplies for the group, batteries, games, Meetup business cards, etc. Over the past 6 years I've acquired over $2000 of debt to run this group and cover Meetup expenses. So it is time to understand the truth and stop making assumption.<\/p> <p>Biagio is pretty Poor and Not rich. Luckily, there hasn\u2019t yet been a need for me to start to begging for money on the side of the street\u2026\u2026\u2026.. yet!<\/p> <p>I am now paying Meetup a $200\u00a0\u00a0fee\u00a0\u00a0every year to run the group.\u00a0In 2015\u00a0we have only collected $150 from members for the Meetup Group Fee so far, and we have not paid off the 2014 debt which is over $500 now. If we cannot get members to pay off the 2014 and 2015 debt\u00a0 then I\u2019m just going to let the group shut down due to lack of \u00a0funding when the 2016 payment is due.<\/p> <p>Don\u2019t forget, \u00a0I pay for batteries, supplies, \u00a0printouts, \u00a0signs, games, stands \u00a0etc. etc. to run this group its over $700 a year, \u00a0which includes the $200 a year Meetup fee!<\/p> <p>So please be informed and\u00a0realize what it takes to run a group this large. Oh and add to that I spend 30+ hours every week of my own time running the group which I get paid $0 for.<\/p> <p>Please help keep the group going. Don\u2019t let not giving $11 a year, every year stop all the fun. Oh and you don\u2019t have to pay the $11 online you can pay the $10 in person or e-mail me to pay by check.<\/p> <p>If you want to pay online Meetup has shut down the Amazon payment feature so you can now pay using Paypal and pay $11 to my PayPal account using e-mail address which is <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"mailto:[masked]\"&gt;===================================<\/a><\/p> <p>With PayPal, you can send money to anyone with an email address.<\/p> <p>Here\u2019s how to send money:<\/p> <p>Log in to your PayPal account.<br\/>Click Send money to a friend at the top of the page.<\/p> <p>Type the email address or mobile number to whom you are sending money, and the\u00a0amount being sent.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

Sadness (voice of Phyllis Smith) isn\u2019t exactly sure what her role is, and frankly, neither is anyone else.<\/p> <p>When Riley's family relocates to a scary new city, the Emotions are on the job, eager to help guide her through the difficult transition. But when Joy and Sadness are inadvertently swept into the far reaches of Riley\u2019s mind\u2014taking some of her core memories with them\u2014Fear, Anger and Disgust are left reluctantly in charge.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>",

We will discuss the current and future of the fight, and what we can do. We will talk about the hearings at Bridgewater State University, which hopefully a number of us attended.<\/p> <p>Governor Baker has directed Paul Sagan the Massachusetts Board of Education Chair to hold a series of public hearings around the state, which will solicit feedback from educators, parents, students and local officials on the PARCC exam and the real-world impact of Common Core standards on teaching and learning. The dates and locations are as follows. This is our opportunity to let our voices be heard.<\/p> <p>The next hearing is Monday, June 22, 2015, North Shore Community College \u2013 Lynn Campus, Gymnasium, 4:00\u20137:00 p.m.<\/p> <p>For those not as familiar with Common Core, we will also take some time to watch the presentation of Building The Machine. We will also see a clip or two from the hearings.<\/p> <p>If time permits, we will talk about Evan Sayet's to recent Boston appearances. Note he will be returning in the fall.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Hi everybody and welcome to another edition of the Manga Club! I hope you\u2019re ready for a change of pace, because it\u2019s time to move beyond the chaos of the bloody past and shifting futures towards something completely different!<\/p> <p>Gender identity is a difficult topic at the best of times. Our ideas of what define gender are shaped by so many factors that it is sometimes difficult to quantify what it is in the first place. Manga is known for pushing certain boundaries in that topic, as we have already seen (*cough* Ranma \u00bd *cough*) and they have been known to treat it in some rather interesting ways.<\/p> <p>Therefore! This month, we shall be returning to a comparison format by looking at two titles which uniquely address this issue. One will show us an alternate history shaped by a major societal shift, while the other addresses our current day to day reality and how such decisions are reflected within it. I am talking about Ooku: The inner Chambers volume 1 by Fumi Yoshinaga and Wandering Son volume 1 by Shimura Takako!<\/p> <p><b>Ooku: The inner Chambers volume 1 by Fumi Yoshinaga <\/b><\/p> <p><i>In Edo period Japan, a strange new disease called the Red Pox has begun to prey on the country's men. Within eighty years of the first outbreak, the male population has fallen by seventy-five percent. Women have taken on all the roles traditionally granted to men, even that of the Shogun. The men, precious providers of life, are carefully protected. And the most beautiful of the men are sent to serve in the Shogun's Inner Chambers. <\/i><\/p> <p><b>Wandering Son Book 1 by Shimura Takako <\/b><\/p> <p><i>The fifth grade. The threshold to puberty, and the beginning of the end of childhood innocence. Shuichi Nitori and his new friend Yoshino Takatsuki have happy homes, loving families, and are well-liked by their classmates. But they share a secret that further complicates a time of life that is awkward for anyone: Shuichi is a boy who wants to be a girl, and Yoshino is a girl who wants to be a boy. Written and drawn by one of today\u2019s most critically acclaimed creators of manga, Shimura portrays Shuishi and Yoshino\u2019s very private journey with affection, sensitivity, gentle humor, and unmistakable flair and grace. Book One introduces our two protagonists and the friends and family whose lives intersect with their own. Yoshino is rudely reminded of her sex by immature boys whose budding interest in girls takes clumsily cruel forms. Shuichi\u2019s secret is discovered by Saori, a perceptive and eccentric classmate. And it is Saori who suggests that the fifth graders put on a production of The Rose of Versailles for the farewell ceremony for the sixth graders \u2014 with boys playing the roles of women, and girls playing the roles of men <\/i><\/p> <p>Both titles are available from our venue for purchase, and copies can also be found in the library.<br\/>Hope to see you soon!<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>(Please note: many of the friends who attend regularly are not Meetup members, so there are always more people attending that it says on the Meetup site.)<\/p> <p>About This Meditation Meetup<\/p> <p>We sit in silence for around 45 minutes, followed by discussion for around 30 minutes or so. The silent sitting is interspersed with some meditation instruction, perhaps a brief reading, a little simple inquiry, exploration or movement. Sitting posture is relaxed, either on a meditation cushion or a bench. It's not a rigid practice- move whenever you need to!<\/p> <p>We meet every Monday night, 7:30 pm at the Cambridge Friends Meeting House. The Friends Meeting House is located at 5 Longfellow Park, Cambridge, MA 02138 You can find a very good map here:\u00a0&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.fmcquaker.org\/FMC-Map_2006.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/fmcquaker.org\/about-friends-meeting-at-cambridge\/directions\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/fmcquaker.org\/about-friends-meeting-at-cambridge\/directions\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Parking is available after 6:00 in the loop off of Brattle St. that leads to the Friend's House, and there is a small lot in back of the Friend's House for those with limited mobility. After that, parking is a little tricky in Cambridge (lots of \"resident only\" signs), but you will find available parking on Mount Auburn St. near Friend's House and on Brattle St. as you head away from Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>Coming by the T is a great option, with the Friend's House being a lovely 15 minute walk out of Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>If you find you are running late, come anyway! The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.<\/p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

Well known consumer technology companies such as Fitbit and Jawbone help wearers keep track of their daily activity, sensors built into watches by Apple and Samsung can measure heart rate throughout the day, and pioneers in digestible sensors such as Proteus Digital Health are developing systems that can track health with metrics from within the body. Companies such as MC10 are pushing the limits of wearables by developing the Biostamp, a sensor that can measure temperature, movement, heart rate, and more within a device that is the size of two postage stamps. As these devices become more ubiquitous, the \"connected human\" will not only be able to monitor health metrics about him\/herself in real-time, but also be able to share that data with healthcare professionals and other individuals. How will we adapt to this fast-approaching reality and what challenges remain to utilize this technology for improving human health?<\/p> <p>Registration is free at <a href=\"http:\/\/bostonbiotech.org\/upcoming-events\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/bostonbiotech.org\/upcoming-events\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Our speakers are Michael Cima (Co-founder of MicroCHIPS), Shahid Azim (CEO of Quanttus), Mandira Singh (Senior Business Developer Athena Health), Ben Schlatka (Co-founder MC10), and Lesley Solomon (Executive Director of Innovation Hub at Brigham and Women's).<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>From fitness bands to ingestible sensors, sensor tech has the potential to drastically change our daily lives. Well known consumer technology companies such as Fitbit and Jawbone help wearers keep track of their daily activity, sensors built into watches by Apple and Samsung can measure heart rate throughout the day, and pioneers in digestible sensors such as Proteus Digital Health are developing systems that can track health with metrics from within the body. Companies such as MC10 are pushing the limits of wearables by developing the Biostamp, a sensor that can measure temperature, movement, heart rate, and more within a device that is the size of two postage stamps. As these devices become more ubiquitous, the \"connected human\" will not only be able to monitor health metrics about him\/herself in real-time, but also be able to share that data with healthcare professionals and other individuals. How will we adapt to this fast-approaching reality and what challenges remain to utilize this technology for improving human health?<\/p> <p>We're thrilled to announce our all-star panelists: Dr. Michael Cima from MIT and co-founder of MicroCHIPS; Shahid Azim, CEO of Quanttus; Ben Schlatka, co-founder of MC10; Mandira Singh, Senior Business Development Manager at Athena Health; and Lesley Solomon, Executive Director of the Innovation Hub at Brigham and Women's! Following the panel discussion there will be a networking session with exhibitions from wearable tech companies.
