ONLY 3% of businesses have a strategy to generate those referrals. Our BNI networking meetings are a proven word of mouth marketing referral generating strategy. Last year, members of BNI (Business Networking International) passed millions of referrals that generated billions of dollars of business for each other. Belonging to BNI is like having dozens of salespeople representing your business, and in return you are representing their businesses. What goes around comes around. If I help you, you\u2019ll help me and we will both benefit as a result.<\/p> <p>The reason \u00a0BNI is so successful is that there is only one person per profession per chapter.

First, Henri will describe the key concepts in predictive maintenance, as well as some applications. Next, he will build a workflow using data from the PHM society data challenge, showing how to go from raw data to the the final predictions. Henri will highlight how to avoid common pitfalls, give examples of what features can be engineered, what techniques and models can be used run to ultimately come up with a robust predictive maintenance model.<\/p> <p><b>Meet the Speaker:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Henri Dwyer <\/b>is a data scientist and engineer working on building the best platform for data scientists at Dataiku. Before, he did physics research on air pollution and solar cells. He received an MSc in Engineering from Columbia University and a BS and an Ms in Engineering from Ecole Polytechnique in Paris. Henri now lives in New York City and is always keen on discovering new data science problems to solve.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Text Understanding, Word2Vec, and Neural Networks<\/b><\/p> <p>Supervised text classification is hampered by the need to acquire expensive labeled training sets. By leveraging algorithms similar to Word2Vec and other neural network based text embedding algorithms one can create vector representations of documents that enable a model to be successfully trained with a drastically reduced training set. By using this technique the implementer can now devote low investment to acquiring a small volume of labeled data examples in order to train proximity thresholds, without devoting significant resources using traditional text classification algorithms which typically require training volume examples that are orders of magnitude larger.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Meet the Speaker:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Mike Tamir<\/b> serves as Chief Science Officer for Galvanize, supervising Galvanize's Immersive Education and accredited Masters Programing. \u00a0He has led several teams of Data Scientists in the bay area as Chief Data Scientist for InterTrust and as Director of Data Sciences for the Sears Holding Company.

It has magic! It has steampunk! Piper has never seen the Mark of the Dragonfly until she finds the girl amid the wreckage of a caravan in the Meteor Fields. The girl doesn't remember a thing about her life, but the intricate tattoo on her arm is proof that she's from the Dragonfly Territories and that she's protected by the king. Which means a reward for Piper if she can get the girl home. The one sure way to the Territories is the 401, a great old beauty of a train. But a ticket costs more coin than Piper could make in a year.

Our thought process is intricately intergraded with the imagery we consume everyday. This language of imagery is fed to us casually and forcefully. This is the very essence of what is merging our collective thought process and our cultures.<br\/>This consumption of commercial propaganda actually makes us closer to one another without noticing that certain barriers have been breeched. I neither desire to judge it negatively or positively in my art, but I have to allow freedom and honesty through my work. I recognize that it is a force in our lives, and that there is someone at the wheel that is not us.<br\/>I think recognizing this idea is to exert your power to steer it in a way, that you find advantages to your beliefs. I always like to give the quick example of growing up in the islands and asking for a coke. After a while asking for a coke does not mean you want specifically a coca cola it just means you want a soda. The brand in essence has taken over a communication bridge; and further more, it does this, in a culture that may be foreign to its origins.<br\/>Imagery was made to communicate and gain leverage to interact with greater accessibility to truly understanding each others desires. It does this by showing us beautiful things that seduce our spirits and intellects. Knowing this I think it is interesting to entertain possibilities never before seen and make more obvious those we see everyday.That awareness is what I talk about in my work, I believe I will make people take notice of what they are consuming not just with their mouths but also with their eyes. Part of me grew up more american then americans living in the US, and part of me always felt a little asian in some way because I consumed so much of their imagery while growing up.<\/p> <p>PRODUCT OF THE MONARCHY is a cultural result of how we communicate with each other, and what we want from another, and how we want to be understood or seen. My brush strokes expose this interaction, my palette and subjects expose the effects of our communication and consumption.<\/p> <p>Ticket:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/opening-reception-product-of-the-monarchy-a-new-exhibition-of-gregory-st-amand-tickets-17973640643\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/opening-reception-product-of-the-monarchy-a-new-exhibition-of-gregory-st-amand-tickets-17973640643\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/opening-reception-product-of-the-monarchy-a-new-exhibition-of-gregory-st-amand-tickets-17973640643<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/La-Maison-dArt-Gallery\/events\/224292843\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":10800000,"name":"Opening reception - \"PRODUCT OF THE MONARCHY\" - Exhibition of Gregory St Amand","id":"224292843","time":1439935200000,"updated":1439949956000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1415308412000,"name":"La Maison d'Art","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":18121382,"urlname":"La-Maison-dArt-Gallery","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10025","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"106th & Riverside Drive Field","address_2":"Enter at 103rd or 108th","name":"Riverside Park","lon":-73.968307,"id":489614,"state":"NY","lat":40.794983,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.31537675858,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1425832794000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Updated March 8th, 2015<\/p> <p>This is one of three sites\/listserves that promotes weekly games that have been going on for many many years.

Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside as a backup.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

The older event, which was never scheduled, will be removed so we can start our sign-ups fresh. In short, if you want to attend this event please visit the link and sign up!<\/p> <p>This month we're happy to present a friend and fellow XPer, Joe Moore, who has years of extensive remote pair programming experience. We're very excited for his talk! Details below: Description:<br\/>Distributed agile teams need not forgo the valuable discipline of pair programming.<br\/>Thanks to ubiquitous high speed internet, advances in online collaboration technologies, and the need to source talent wherever they might be, remote pair programming is becoming more common. Remote pair programming is surprisingly simple to implement, but it's not just about bleeding-edge technology -- a good attitude is just as important as good technology. Joe will walk you through how your distributed team can successfully implement remote pair programming, allowing you to not only reap the same benefits as in-person pairing but also bring your teams closer together, even if they are miles apart.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br\/>Joe began writing software in the late \u201990s at a large insurance company. He soon moved to Evant, an early case study for eXtreme Programming and Agile software development processes. In 2005 Joe joined Pivotal Labs as a founding member of Pivotal\u2019s Ruby on Rails practice. Joe has led eXtreme programming projects for a wide variety of clients, ranging from one-person start-ups to the world\u2019s largest social networks. Since 2010 Joe has remote pair programmed full time with Pivotal coworkers and clients around the world. He also blogs about his his passion, remote pair programming, at <a href=\"http:\/\/remotepairprogramming.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/remotepairprogramming.com<\/a>.<\/p> <p>See you soon!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/xp-26\/events\/224372433\/","yes_rsvp_count":37,"duration":9000000,"name":"Remote Pair Programming: A guide for distributed teams","id":"224372433","time":1439937000000,"updated":1439949987000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1184300403000,"name":"The New York XP & Agile Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":566361,"urlname":"xp-26","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Extreme Programmers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"1657 1st Ave","name":"Vino Versity","lon":-73.949257,"id":23752127,"lat":40.777031,"repinned":false},"headcount":47,"distance":2.84020495415,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438475704000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>This is such a fun wine tasting and sells out every time!\u00a0If you are new to wine or a die hard fan, this is a great experience for all!

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't open our door from 6:30 - 7 pm while meditation is in progress. Kindly refrain from ringing our buzzer during this time.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/224274370\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjytlbxb","time":1439937000000,"updated":1439950803000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"48 Wall St. - 15th floor","name":"Dev Bootcamp NYC","lon":-74.009109,"id":18628382,"state":"NY","lat":40.70649,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":35,"headcount":0,"distance":3.17498874664,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438871500000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Do you like building things?

Citygram aims to create a model for visualizing and applying computational techniques to produce metrics and further our knowledge of cities such as NYC and LA. The project will enable a richer representation and understanding of cities defined by humans, visible\/invisible energies, buildings, machines, and other biotic\/abiotic entities. Our freely Internet-accessible system will yield high impact results that are general enough for a wide range of applications for residents, businesses, and visitors to cities like NYC and LA. Our collaboration with NYU CUSP has been especially fruitful in the context of measuring and quantifying urban spatio-acoustic noise and using NYC as a research lab.

In the first, \"the rat race\", the player aims to raise his or her character's passive income level to where it exceeds the character's expenses. The winner is determined in the second stage, \"the fast track\". To win, a player must get his or her character to buy their \"dream\" or accumulate an additional $50,000 in monthly cash flow.<\/p> <p>In place of \u201cscore cards\u201d, there are financial statements. The game requires the players to fill out their own financial statements so that they can see more clearly what is happening with their money.

The ideas expressed here will remove from your consciousness any fear of so-called death.<\/p> <p>Reincarnation is one of the world's most disputed doctrine. The belief in reincarnation has had millions of intelligent, learned, and tolerant followers throughout the ages. Ringing through the minds and hearts of students, mystics, and thinkers have always been the words: \"Why Are We Here?\" Reincarnation has been criticized by some as conflicting with sacred literature and as being without verification. This book reveals, however, in an intelligent manner the many facts to support reincarnation.<\/p> <p>Quotations from eminent authorities, and from Biblical\u00a0and Sacred works substantiate reincarnation. It places it high above mere speculation. This book is without exaggeration the most complete, inspiring, enlightening book ever written on this subject. It is not a fiction story but a step-by-step revelation of profound mystical laws. Look at some of these thought-provoking, intriguing subjects: The Cosmic Conception; The Personality of the Soul; Does Personality Survive Transition?; Heredity and Inheritance; Karma and Personal Evolution; Religious and Biblical Viewpoints; Christian References; Between Incarnations; Souls of Animals and the \"Unborn\"; Recollections of the Past.<\/p> <p><b>All are Welcome!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/224384061\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Circle of Spiritual Inquiry - Mansions of the Soul","id":"fpbtflytlbxb","time":1439937000000,"updated":1439950044000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10034","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"330 West 40th street, (between 8th and 9th avenue)","name":"Skyroom Rooftop","lon":-73.918007,"id":2683201,"state":"NY","lat":40.862411,"repinned":false},"headcount":216,"distance":8.64890575409,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439814999000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Join NYC's hottest fashionistas at MEETUP's #1 FASHION MIXER! \u00a0200+ attend every time we do it!

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts.

Its very nice when this happens and it happens a lot.<\/p> <p>Tong Ren is another form of healing using tapping but unlike EFT it doesnt involve any dialog to describe the issues of concern.

The sea snail was great too.<\/p> <p><br\/>With the octopus, you have the option of having one (or both) served on the side, so you can eat it raw while moving. Even 20 mins after it was cut up, its pieces would move when poked.<\/p> <p>I think the place is open from 10 or 11am until 4am. They are located on the intersection of 49th St &amp; Roosevelt Ave, a 15min drive from Midtown East (you can street park), or a short subway ride on the (7) to 46th St\/Bliss St in Sunnyside, Queens. The resto is technically in Woodside.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nIf you go, order the watermelon soju too. It comes in a large watermelon, and tastes very good.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nI highly recommend this place to seafood lovers. The food was fresh and delicious. It's a must for adventurous foodies!

UX design, as a field, is constantly evolving for how we create solutions. There\u2019s no greater example of that evolution than prototyping. A prototype is an early sample or mode of a product which is built to test a concept or process. Sometimes prototypes serve the purpose of replication or education about a product. When it comes to building great products, there's nothing better than going from idea to a prototype quickly to make sure your idea and designs are the right approach for your users.<\/p> <p><br\/>For this Meetup, we will be getting our hands dirty and jumping right into the action. We\u2019ll use <a href=\"http:\/\/bohemiancoding.com\/sketch\/\">Sketch<\/a> to create mockups and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.invisionapp.com\/\">InVision<\/a> to create a prototype. This Meetup is about understanding how using these tools can allow you to create quality prototypes quickly and easily, without code, so you can get your ideas in front of a customer fast in order to gain valuable feedback. All this before a single line of code is written.<\/p> <p><br\/>We can\u2019t wait to finally have the chance for all our developers, designers, and operations team to come together and dive into this interactive design Meetup.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nJust a few instructions for what to prepare before Wednesday night:\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>1.

The philosophy is that you can apply an algorithm or analysis method best when you understand the theory behind it. Hence, we have a strong focus on theory, but with an eye toward application. We're an extremely informal group. While many of us are professionals in quantitative fields, none of us are necessarily experts in the topics we're covering.

In this talk, we'll go over how we can implement coroutines in ES6 using generators and promises, as well as tools and libraries that allow you to leverage coroutines\u00a0<i>today<\/i>. We'll also walk through some sample use cases that showcase the power of coroutines.<\/p> <p><b>Lightning Talk - <i>Jimmy Farrell<\/i> - Downstream and Upstream Request Flow with the Koa Web Framework<\/b><\/p> <p>Express.js has become the default Node.js web application framework. But that doesn\u2019t mean it is the only technology that\u00a0developers can use, nor is it always the best solution for Node developers. Koa, started in 2013, is a lightweight web\u00a0application framework that is unique in its use of ES6 generators in its architecture. This\u00a0talk\u00a0will give a brief introduction to\u00a0Koa as an alternative to Express.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Lightning Talk - <i>Eddie Zaneski<\/i> - A Glance at the ES6 Tooling of Today<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>Even though the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) specification was recently finalized, it will be a while before there is widespread browser adoption.

The workout fuses cardio, Pilates, isometric movements, plyometrics and Isometric poses into a 45-minute series.

During the 1950s and 60s, painting, sculpture, and architecture were dominated by men; women however had considerable impact in alternative materials such as textiles, ceramics, and metals. Largely unexamined in major art historical surveys these pioneering women achieved international success, establishing a model of professional identity for future women.<\/p> <p>[masked] - Floor 3 - RICHARD ESTES PAINTING NEW YORK CITY presents works by this quintessential New York artist and leader of the Photorealist movement. Paintings and works on paper, including his photographs, silkscreens and woodcuts from the 1960s to present are on view.<\/p> <p>[masked] Floor 2 - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.madmuseum.org\/exhibition\/ralph-pucci\">RALPH PUCCI THE ART OF THE MANNEQUIN<\/a>\u00a0is\u00a0the first museum exhibition to explore the work of revered designer Ralph Pucci, who is widely noted for his innovative and expressive approach to the everyday form of the mannequin.\u00a0Pucci\u2019s mannequins not only artfully expand the parameters of this familiar sculptural form, but reflect cultural trends of the past three decades as he has collaborated with fashion icons such as Diane von Furstenberg, Patrick Naggar, Kenny Scharf, Anna Sui, Isabel and Ruben Toledo and Christy Turlington. Over 30 of his mannequins will be on view.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>Keep a copy of the schedule if you would like to stay with the group.

Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside as a backup.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East.

My Aunt\u00a0Seida asked me to help her sort out his house and go through the trove of mementos he had left behind. Julio was the younger brother of Seida\u2019s husband, Rene. As such, he was never a big presence in my life growing up in 1970\u2019s Miami.<\/p> <p>As a child I remember going to his soirees, filled with hairstylists, decorators, designers, actors, bon vivants and family members. His extravagant house was an ad hoc mixture of Las Vegas and Versailles. Wine and drugs flowed freely and it felt frivolous, decadent and very superficial--not much deeper than surface decoration. So very different from the macho Cuban environment I grew up in. Julio, an openly gay man, was not actively pursued for his company by my parents, as he was in their opinion, \u201cnot a good influence on the kids.\u201d<\/p> <p>As I perused his photographs and papers, a lineal description of his life started to emerge\u2026 and it was very different from my childhood perception of him. I discovered an old photo of Julio as a skinny kid from a small town just outside of Havana and another showing him as a young adult preforming a magic show on a boat in front of a crowd of humorless American tourists.<\/p> <p>My Aunt explained in the 1950\u2019s Julio worked every night on the Floridita, a ferry between Miami and Havana. \u201cHe fed all his brothers and sisters in Cuba for years doing that and if it weren\u2019t for him, neither Rene nor I would be here today.\u201d<\/p> <p>My curiosity was piqued, so I pressed Seida to explain further. Apparently Julio moved to Miami in 1959, got his papers and paid for seven family members to come to America. Once here, he helped them financially until we were on their feet. He borrowed money and waited tables in Miami Beach, doing double shifts 6 days a week for years and was in debt for the longest time.<\/p> <p>Wow\u2026 all the silly flocked wallpaper, silk flowers, heavy drapes and overly ornate furniture that surrounded me didn\u2019t seem so frivolous any more. It felt more like a fantasy escape to another world. This flamboyant man who I had never paid much attention to, suddenly became the savior of his family. Never had such an impression of someone changed so suddenly for me.<\/p> <p>I am fascinated with how mankind works to interpret its past and embrace its future in this ever-changing world. As individuals we are shaped by our memories and upbringings; our cultural values define our opinions about the world. As the economy, technology and social policy evolve, we are pushed to constantly reassess our beliefs and who we are at our very core. As our society develops, so does the recognition and discovery of our true selves.<\/p> <p>In this highly personal series, I delve into my changing perception of Julio. I explore the physical space in which he lived and examine the objects that he surrounded himself by. I\u2019ve come to strangely appreciate the gaudy decadence of his home, representing his dream to come to the US. Learning that he paid for it with his hard-earned money after helping his family escape from 1960\u2019s Cuba made it all that more poignant.<\/p> <p>As a gay man myself I felt a great pride when I learned of his courage and dedication to a family that eschewed his lifestyle.<\/p> <p>\u2013 Orestes Gonzalez, 2015<\/p> <p>\n\n\nArtist's Bio:<\/p> <p>As an architect, Orestes Gonzalez is very conscious of proportion, scale and the overall effect of space upon its inhabitants. His images of interiors, people and monuments document man\u2019s foibles and experiences on both a grand and personal scale.<\/p> <p>Orestes, a pillar in the Long Island City arts community, shoots for a monthly photo column \u201cOrestes LIC\u201d in LIC Courier Magazine, documenting the changes and activities in the most rapidly developing neighborhood of Queens.<\/p> <p>The first chapter of his photo essay, Portraits of Artists is viewable on <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/42360212.\">Vimeo<\/a> and depicts fellow artists in their workspaces in his community. This series will continue with artists from Miami, Havana, Buenos Aires and Nova Scotia. Portraits of Artists will culminate in his second monograph book, which is currently in the preliminary production stage. His first self-published monograph, Street Life, is for sale on his website.<\/p> <p>Orestes is currently working on a long-term photo project, Cuban Portraits, which will depict Cuban families in their personal living spaces in both Miami and Havana.<\/p> <p>His work has been published in magazines and has works in corporate and private collections.
