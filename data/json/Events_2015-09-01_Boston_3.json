Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Vipassana meditation encourages us to experience each moment exactly how it is, fostering presence and awareness.<\/p> <p>In this practice we allow thoughts, emotions, and all other stimuli to surface. We become a witness of these, cultivating a space of non-attachment and revealing a deeper connection with one's inner self.<\/p> <p>Newcomers to meditation and long-time practitioners are welcome to attend. This is a <b>FREE<\/b>\u00a0practice. There is a suggested donation, but that is not required to attend.<\/p>",

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<\/p> <p>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<\/p> <p>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/p> <p>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<\/p> <p>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<\/p> <p>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/p> <p>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/p> <p>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<\/p> <p>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><b><i>Alternate Tuesdays at 7:30 PM at Unity of Somerville, located at 6 William Street at the corner of College Avenue<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Call (913)[masked] to learn more<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

We guarantee 6 playing partners at your playing level, but have been averaging closer to 15+ partners in most cities.<\/p> <p><b>Your Task - \"Flexible Scheduling\"<\/b><\/p> <p>After this kickoff email is sent, it is the player's task to communicate with other players. Players should work with their partners to find an agreeable time and location to play the match. While TennisNorthEast doesn't mandate your playing schedule, it is recommended that players schedule at least one match per week. By request of the players, we started to allow players to play 1 rematch per season. The regular season is all about playing as much as you can. As of Jan. 1st, 2013 we've had 189 players play more than 20 matches in a season.<\/p> <p><b>Where to Play?<\/b><\/p> <p>Play at your local free tennis courts, tennis parks, condo courts or tennis clubs. The league strongly suggests that players jointly try to pick a tennis court location convenient to both. We provide an extensive list\u00a0of <a href=\"http:\/\/tennisnortheast.com\/TennisCourts\">tennis courts<\/a>, including # of courts, lighting, hitting walls, etc.\u00a0We strive to keep this list up-to-date.<\/p> <p>TennisNorthEast sets up a must play dates to push players out on the courts. The final deadline is the date marking the end of the season, at which point players with 5 wins will qualify for a post-season playoff to determine the league champion.<\/p> <p><b>How to Play?<\/b><\/p> <p>Players can use three semi-standard playing formats: 2 out of 3 sets, 2 sets with 10 point super tie-breaker or the 10-game pro set (First to 10, used when court time is limited).<\/p> <p><b>Playoffs<\/b><\/p> <p>Each season concludes with a playoffs where players with anywhere from 3 to 5 season wins qualifies for a single elimination tourney.\u00a0 The champion is awarded based upon the league <a href=\"http:\/\/tennisnortheast.com\/info\/prize_pool3\">Prize Pool<\/a>.

        "description": "<p>The process of modeling a stock\u2019s returns through macroeconomic factors (factor modeling) is widely implemented in finance. Factor models can be used to determine your algorithm\u2019s exposure to risk, or to construct arbitrage strategies. An example of a factor model could be using the price of oil, treasury rate, and a national stability index to predict the returns of every stock in the S&amp;P 500.<\/p> <p>During this meetup, we will discuss how to implement factor models and different ways they can be useful for strategy research and design.<\/p> <p>This talk is part of Quantopian\u2019s Summer Lecture Series. We are currently developing a quant finance curriculum and will be releasing clone-able notebooks and algorithms to go along with this lecture.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Pizza and beer will be served.<\/p> <p><b>Speaker Details<\/b><\/p> <p>Delaney Granizo-Mackenzie will be presenting.\u00a0Delaney is an engineer at Quantopian whose focus is on how Quantopian can be used as a teaching tool. After studying computer science at Princeton, Delaney joined Quantopian in 2014. Since then he has led successful course integrations at MIT Sloan and Stanford, and is planning on expanding to many more schools this fall.

        "description": "<p>While harsh words by Paula Deen, Ronald Sterling, and Cliven Bundy have rocked white America in the past year, these isolated events reflect an older, more tangible form of racism. Meanwhile, the more powerful antagonist, modern, or \u2018elegant,\u2019 racism goes largely unnoticed. Waking Up White, a new book by racial justice educator Debby Irving, provides critical context that allows white people to quickly grasp modern racism\u2019s inner workings and enter into conversations with new awareness and skill.<\/p> <p>Waking Up White functions as both a \u201cRacism 101\u201d for white people and a rare expos\u00e9 on whiteness for people of color. The book is a catalytic kick-starter that provides people of all colors and levels of racial awareness with the language and tools necessary to enter into cross-racial conversations about race within a less threatening context. For white readers wanting to further their own awakening, Irving includes short prompts and exercises at the end of each chapter.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhen I finally came to understand the way racism worked,\u201d she explains, \u201cI spent a lot of time thinking about what might have enlightened me earlier. I decided it wouldn\u2019t have been an academic book, an essay, or a book from the perspective of a person of color -- it would have been another white person describing their own awakening, with some humor, poignancy and drama in the mix. What I needed was a memoir so irresistible that I would have read it even if racism weren\u2019t on my mind.\u201d<\/p> <p>Join us at the Hub for a conversation with Debby on Wednesday, August 26.<\/p>",

Here is <a href=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/9\/f\/e\/highres_16055326.jpeg\">a map of the area<\/a>.<\/p> <p>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that MTG Boston members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>An evening of gut-wrenching live readings from Jessica Bebenek, JC Bouchard, dalton derkson, JM Francheteau, and Julie Mannell. Their limited-edition chapbook will also be available for sale.<\/p> <p>Worst Case Ontario is a collaboration between five young Canadian poets and writers who one day dreamed a dream of stuffing themselves into a rented sedan and etching a route between any outpost in Canada and the States that would allow them a mic and the time to go to work. We think that literature is built by new voices, diverse voices, voices that seek to break and won\u2019t be broken.<\/p> <p>ABOUT THE POETS:<\/p> <p>JESSICA BEBENEK is a Toronto poet and writer currently living in Montreal. Her writing appears in Prairie Fire, Grain, The Puritan, and Little Brother, among other places. She is the founder of the micro-press Grow &amp; Gsrow and the author of three chapbooks, most recently Kettle Song. This fall, she begins an MA in English &amp; Creative Writing at Concordia University to continue work on her first full collection of poetry, tentatively titled No One Knows Us There. But mainly right now she knits. For more information: www.jessicabebenek.com<\/p> <p>JC BOUCHARD was born in Elliot Lake, a former mining town in northern Ontario. His poetry has appeared in Arc, untethered, In\/Words, (parenthetical), Rappahannock Review, Control, and more. One of his poems was long-listed for the CBC Poetry Prize and another received Honourable Mention for the John Newlove Poetry Award from Bywords. He is the author of two chapbooks: Portraits (In\/Words Press), and Wool Water (words(on)pages), forthcoming in Fall 2015. He lives in Toronto. DALTON DERKSON is a punk poet from the prairies, currently residing in Toronto. He runs Hurtin\u2019 Cr\u00fce Press, a D.I.Y. collective through which he promotes fellow Canadian poets and self-publishes too many chapbooks. Upon arriving in the city, he was superkicked by The Party Animal and quite frankly, his poems haven\u2019t been the same since. For proof, check out his recent work in ottawater, SPANK the CARP, and In\/Words magazine or find him on Twitter @dirtyderk.<\/p> <p>JM FRANCHETEAU is a rural transplant based in Ottawa, ON. His writing has appeared mostly recently in CV2, Arc, Broken Pencil and untethered, and his second chapbook, kids, is out with Hurtin\u2019 Cr\u00fce Press. He cowrites the zine Nightshift and organizes the Ottawa Zine Off! series. For more information: www.jmfrancheteau.wordpress.com<\/p> <p>JULIE MANNELL is a Montreal-based writer of prose, poetry, and essays, originally from Fonthill, Ontario. Mannell currently writes for The Huffington Post, and her work has appeared in several journals, magazines, and textbooks. She is the recipient of the Lionel Shapiro Award for Excellency in Creative Writing and The Mona Adilman Poetry Prize. Mannell founded the McGill Creative Writing Society where she facilitated workshops and panels for three years. In 2012 Roseanne Barr gave Mannell the Vagenius Award. Visit www.juliemannell.com and follow her on Twitter @juliemannell.<\/p> <p>The Worst Case Ontario chapbook will be available for purchase during event.<\/p>",

I doubt this will be much of an issue, given our typical attendance numbers.<\/p> <p>* Because our events tend to be small, and the games we typically play tend to be long, if at all possible, please let us know if you plan to be more than a couple of minutes late so that we don't launch into something without you. Likewise, if you're planning on arriving more than a half-hour late, you should be aware that it may not be possible to include you in a game. You're welcome to come by and hang out but the chances are better than even that we'll be hip-deep in gaming goodness by the time you arrive.<\/p> <p>* Please be respectful of our hosts; stay mindful of closing time and throw 'em some business if you're hungry.<\/p> <p>* Have fun and roll high!<\/p>",

Come and join us for an evening of fun games and a different format from our usual TurnON.<\/p> <p>The games will be led by Liz Markle, founder of the Boston OM Community (visiting from California!). For those of you who remember the early days of TurnON Boston, we don't need to tell you how great this is going to be. And for those of you who weren't around back then - come out and join the fun!<\/p> <p>The games we play (all clothes on, no contact) will give you the opportunity to look deeper into yourself in a playful, genuine way, and connect authentically with the other people around you.<\/p> <p>TurnON Boston is an organization that teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM. At the end of the evening, we will give you a brief description of the practice of Orgasmic Meditation and information on where to learn more.<\/p> <p>Please aim to arrive by 7:20!<\/p> <p>Cost is $10, payable at the door.<\/p>",

This is a great chance to add some film noir spice to your portfolio.<\/p> <p>Members, by all means please bring props and wardrobe accessories that fit this theme, if you have them: for example, furs, veils, 40's and 50's hats, necklaces, etc.<\/p> <p>Setup will start at 6:30 pm, we will have a short business meeting at 7:30 pm, and shooting will start as soon as possible after that.

If you're a beginner or just interested in culture, you'll fit in fine! Don't miss out on this opportunity to learn and practice over a few drinks. Can't make it on time? Need to leave early? Not a problem. Just stop by if you can!<\/p> <p><b>If you are &gt;21 and plan to drink, please bring a MA state issued ID or passport. Other state IDs may not be accepted. Please order at the bar and take care of your own tab.<\/b><\/p> <p>Transportation: I highly recommend using public transportation. Not only is driving while intoxicated dangerous, but there may not be any parking available in the area. A lot of the <b>parking on Newbury St \u00a0is Residential Only <\/b>in the evenings, and many of the signs indicating this are very well hidden. If you insist on parking in the area, be aware that meter maids love handing out parking tickets around here.\u00a0Best methods for public transportation are the green line subway or bus #1 to the Hynes stop.<\/p> <p>I have made an arrangements with the Itadaki staff for a simpler ordering method. Last time was very chaotic and stressful for the bartender, so lets do our best to not confuse the bartender. :)<\/p> <p><b>Ordering at Itadaki<\/b><\/p> <p>1) Order your first drink at the bar. If it's alcoholic, your ID will be checked at this time. You will also be \u00a0given a guest number to use the rest of the night.<\/p> <p>2) If you're at a table, the bartender will try to make several rounds throughout the night to take additional orders. Keep using your guest number and please feel free to order more food and drinks.<\/p> <p>3) Keep in mind we're a pretty large group so don't be offended or annoyed with the bartender if he doesn't get to you right away. If you have an urgent order, go request it at the bar.<\/p> <p>4) Please take care of your tab and don't forget to tip*. The management and staff are doing a lot to make this all possible.<\/p> <p>*Note: If the group is large, an 18% tip may already be included.<\/p> <p>See you there!<br\/>~Lindsay<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>NUTSHELL - every week\u00a0day, 12:15ish until 1:45ish, Cumnock Turf Fields at Harvard Stadium, games of 4v4 up to 10v10 or larger depending on who shows, bring a white shirt and a dark\/colored shirt (but not a gray one), almost never canceled, read\u00a0below for more details before asking questions that are answered here, and read the comments for today's meetup to see if there is\u00a0anything important\u00a0about today.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\"><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT - Harvard Square is the closest T stop (red line). \u00a0Check Google Maps or other to find fastest way there from wherever you are.<\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY RIDE SHARE - a lot of players in this meetup come by car and are nice enough to offer rides to others. Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

We alternate walks between the inner and outer loops which are both under 3 miles. It usually takes less than an hour. We walk past a playground too, so we could stop and play there for a while. Afterwards, we sit at the picnic tables under the trees by the visitor center and feed our babies, chat, etc.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will meet outside the visitor center in the upper parking lot on the Saugus side of the park, past the Kasabuski Skating Rink. \u00a0There are bathrooms with a changing table in the visitor center too.<\/p> <p>Running late? \u00a0No prob.

They are coming to Boston on the afternoon of August 28 at Dewey Square, the start of the Rose Kennedy Greenway near South Station. For those of you not familiar with his work or who have never seen a Strandbeest, see the link below.<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bostonmagazine.com\/arts-entertainment\/blog\/2015\/07\/24\/strandbeest-boston\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bostonmagazine.com\/arts-entertainment\/blog\/2015\/07\/24\/strandbeest-boston\/<\/a><\/p> <p>I'm not sure how much of a photo op this is going to be (perhaps more of a video thing if there is enough wind to get these guys walking) but I know I sure want to see these bad boys up close and personal. The schedule says they'll be at Dewey Square from 4:30 to 7:00 so lets meet up at the Red Line head house in Dewey Square at 4:30. When the Strandbeests leave, maybe we can shoot some of the Boston Design Biennial sculptures on the Greenway which should still be in place as far as I know.<\/p>",

Once meditative, your experience of the life within you and the world around you becomes much deeper and richer. Daily activity becomes effortless and joyful.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>You can easily learn this 12-to-18 minute Isha Kriya process in one session and practice on your own, or return to class to ask questions and deepen the experience<\/b> with the group. Benefits of regular practice include improving health, energy and vitality; enhancing mental focus, memory and clarity; reducing stress and establishing a deep sense of peace and inner balance.<\/p> <p>Isha Kriya is a gentle, seated practice, which can be practiced in a chair. No previous meditation experience is necessary.<\/p> <p><i>The Isha Kriya process was developed by realized yogi, Sadhguru Vasudev. Sadhguru is renowned for his powerful yoga and meditation programs, as well as thriving humanitarian initiatives. He has been hosted to speak and offer meditations at numerous global leadership forums, businesses and universities, including the United Nations, the World Economic Forum, the British House of Lords, TED, MIT, and the World Peace Congress<\/i>.<\/p> <p>This free session will be facilitated by a trained Isha Kriya instructor.

Sitting 21,000 feet above the sacred Ganges River in Northern India, the mountain\u2019s perversely stacked obstacles make it both a nightmare and an irresistible calling for some of the world's toughest climbers. In October 2008, renowned alpinists Conrad Anker, Jimmy Chin and Renan Ozturk arrived in India to tackle Meru. Their planned seven-day trip quickly devolved into a 20-day odyssey in sub-zero temperatures with depleting food rations. Within 100 meters of the elusive summit, their journey\u2014like all previous attempts\u2014fell short of the goal. Heartbroken and defeated, the trio returned to their everyday lives. By September 2011, Anker had convinced his team to reunite and undertake the Shark's Fin once more, under even more extraordinary circumstances. Winner of the Sundance Film Festival Audience Award for Documentary, Meru is the story of that journey, an expedition through nature's harshest elements and one's complicated inner demons, and ultimately on to impossible new heights.<\/p>",

Students will discover their own innate psychic skill and talents through a series of exercises designed to gently open the third eye and make them aware of the unseen world around them. This class will focus on psychic protection and spiritual hygiene and spiritual awareness and will be instrumental in identifying and developing the individual psychic skills of each student. We will also explore the wonders of mediumship and connect with the realm of spirit through a small group s\u00e9ance. In each class students will have the opportunity to experiment with different psychic tools and techniques along with learning a brief history about each practice. In the first class we will discuss Tarot cards and learn the systems behind the symbolism in the cards, which make them such a useful tool in divination. We will also experiment with dowsing, using both rods and pendulums to answer simple questions and find lost items, we will introduce as well the ancient art of scrying on liquid, flame and crystal surfaces. We will also delve into palmistry and learn how to be prepared for certain changes in our own lives by studying some of the major lines on our hands. We will learn how to read tea leaves and throw bones as well. Both of these famous systems from antiquity have complex histories and variations that will also be discussed. Cost: $25.00<\/p>",

Request you NOT be late as we will not wait. We will talk about Cityscapes photography and how to take pictures of nightscapes in the city.<\/p> <p>Where shall we meet? We will meet at the exact co-ordinates mentioned in the Location area. Please punch that in Google Maps (iPhone, Android, GPS devices). There are plenty of Parking areas around the location on Congress Street and Seaport Blvd. But lately due to construction they are mostly filled up. In case you have difficulty with street parking, please use your discretion and park at the paid parking areas mentioned below:<\/p> <p>[masked] Congress St<br\/>Boston, MA 02210<br\/>[masked], [masked]<\/p> <p>142 Northern Ave<br\/>Boston, MA 02210<br\/>[masked], [masked]<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/5\/7\/1\/600_435714641.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>What should I bring? Of course your camera, preferably a DSLR, which has Manual Settings. Tripod is a must and please do carry an Intervalometer. (If you are not sure what it is, please try to procure one after reading the Group Blog.) You will need it down the line. You will need an UWA to Medium Wide lens anywhere between 14 mm to 70 mm. If you prefer doing strong abstracts you may get long range zooms. We will be talking about, Exposure, Aperture and ISO modes. We will also dwell on WB, RGB and straightening pictures in camera. For those who have intervalometers we will be talking about settings for star trails and the usage of the devices.<\/p> <p>What are we going to do? Weather is absolutely clear and in the pleasant 60s in the evening. If you are interested we will be doing Star Trails with Cityscapes. It is challenging with bright lights and faint stars because of light pollution.<\/p> <p>Do I need to know anything else? Yes. Please remember it is the night time and we will be spending time at the harbor area. Please be courteous to others when positioning your tripods or walking during the shot. You will be pretty close to the water, so take extra caution to see where you are stepping. Having members or the equipment getting drenched is something that we would love to avoid.<\/p> <p>Our ultimate objective will be to learn and have fun.<\/p> <p>Please check out pictures from our Meetup before:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/photos\/25729806\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/photos\/25729806\/<\/a><\/p>",

Send email to [masked] to reserve a seat. \u00a0<b> WE <i>DO NOT<\/i> ACCEPT RESERVATIONS ON MEETUP - YOU MUST SEND US EMAIL (to [masked]) TO MAKE A RESERVATION.<\/b><\/p> <p>Describing herself simply as a \"Modern English Musician\" Eliza Carthy, at 39, is only now beginning to reach the height of her musical powers. During a 25-year journey\/career she has become one of the most dazzling and recognised folk musicians of a generation. She has revitalised and made folk music relevant to new audiences and has captured the most hardened of dissenters with canny, charismatic and boundary-crossing performance. Many of the current crop of young professional folk musicians owe their successes in part to her determination, standard-bearing and campaigning spirit.<\/p> <p><br\/>Yorkshire-born and based in Edinburgh since 1997, Eliza, daughter of legendary British folk icons Martin Carthy and Norma Waterson, grew up immersed in the world of traditional English music. She has lived a life based on the philosophy that it is a genre worthy of and equal to any other, and that musicians need no boundaries and deserve no restrictions to what they do as artists.<\/p> <p>Touring on and off since the age of fourteen, Eliza has appeared at a huge number of live events, multi-artist concerts and benefits from Robin Hood's Bay Village Hall to the Albert Hall. She has been a part of three Meltdowns at London's Southbank: those of Nick Cave, Patti Smith and Richard Thompson. This year she has been invited to curate her own three day event at Kings Place in London.<\/p> <p>Eliza rarely performs solo, so this is a very rare treat, and we expect it to sell out and gather up a long waiting list! Be sure to make your reservations quickly.<\/p>",

Bluegrass, jazz and old-time music are all present here in their ways, along with a dose of classical chamber music composition and arrangement, as the members all draw from their wide array of musical loves, experiences and influences. These influences boil down into the trio\u2019s own organic sound of New Acoustic music, or Modern String Band music, or Chamber Grass (music is getting harder and harder to label these days, isn\u2019t it?). Whatever label you put on it, it is guaranteed to be fresh and original, and definitely something you\u2019ve never quite heard before.<\/p> <p>The trio began doing \u201cMusic du Jour\u201d tours in 2006, in which each member of the group writes a new composition the day of the show, and all three new pieces are performed on that evening\u2019s concert. After several of these tours the trio recorded its first CD, \u201cMusic du Jour,\u201d on Compass Records in 2009. They have now performed over 130 \u201cdu Jour\u201d shows around the U.S., and continue to explore new frontiers and new sounds in acoustic string band music. Their second CD, \u201cWinter Harvest,\u201d was released on Compass Records in 2012. Watch for their upcoming CD, \u201cTraveling Roots,\u201d in early 2016.<\/p> <p>Ticket sales - <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/the-matt-flinner-trio-tickets-17935569772\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/the-matt-flinner-trio-tickets-17935569772<\/a> - end Friday at\u00a05pm.\u00a0Get yours in time to have\u00a0dinner before the show.<\/p> <p>The concert series is partnered with two nearby restaurants, ideal for a pre-show meet-up.

Bluegrass, jazz and old-time music are all present here in their ways, along with a dose of classical chamber music composition and arrangement, as the members all draw from their wide array of musical loves, experiences and influences. These influences boil down into the trio\u2019s own organic sound of New Acoustic music, or Modern String Band music, or Chamber Grass (music is getting harder and harder to label these days, isn\u2019t it?). Whatever label you put on it, it is guaranteed to be fresh and original, and definitely something you\u2019ve never quite heard before.<\/p> <p>The trio began doing \u201cMusic du Jour\u201d tours in 2006, in which each member of the group writes a new composition the day of the show, and all three new pieces are performed on that evening\u2019s concert. After several of these tours the trio recorded its first CD, \u201cMusic du Jour,\u201d on Compass Records in 2009. They have now performed over 130 \u201cdu Jour\u201d shows around the U.S., and continue to explore new frontiers and new sounds in acoustic string band music. Their second CD, \u201cWinter Harvest,\u201d was released on Compass Records in 2012. Watch for their upcoming CD, \u201cTraveling Roots,\u201d in early 2016.<\/p> <p><b>Dinner and a show.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>The concert series is partnered with two nearby restaurants, ideal for a pre-show meet-up.

We usually have enough people to split up into sub-groups of leisure walkers and speedsters.<\/p> <p>I use Map My Walk to keep track of our time and distance. This is a free app that you can download to your smartphone, should you want to start keeping track of your exercise, minutes and calories burned. It has a lot of features that I am sure you would have fun with.<\/p> <p>If you can, let me know if you will be walking with us, so we don\u2019t start without you. If we are all gathered before 8 we tend to just get going at that point.<\/p> <p>If you are interested in joining our walking club, either this time or sometime in the future, please let me know and I will include you on that email list.<br\/>Laureen House [masked]<\/p>",

We ride about 85 miles to P'town and take the 4:30 ferry back to Plymouth to close the loop and round out a fine day.<\/p> <p>The math means doing 85 miles in 8 hours. I aim for a 12 mph moving average for 7 hours, so there is an hour of slack in the schedule. If winds are unfavorable, we can stage one car further south in order to shave off a few miles, nematode, and guarantee we make it the ferry.<\/p> <p>Heads up items:<br\/>* Make sure you feel comfortable going the distance. The pace is not demanding, but the ferry ain't waiting.<br\/>* We will pick up the rail-trail around mile 40 and take it to mile 65. If at mile 40 somebody is noticeably dragging, they may choose this as a good turn around point. \u00a0At least there won't be riding back under time pressure.<br\/>* This ride is for determined and sociable turtles, not aloof hares!<br\/>* Ferry tickets book out so book early!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nRoute profile<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/3\/d\/3\/600_440874227.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Route plan. \u00a0 Adding a few miles by taking less traveled roads.<\/p> <p>Update:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/8\/0\/600_441289024.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Ignore this old one, which doesn't seem to want to be deleted.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/3\/d\/9\/600_440874233.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Spotted on the route. \u00a0 Appropriate.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/7\/9\/6\/600_441282902.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

A well attended venue for triathletes training for races of all distances.<\/p> <p>The gate opens at 7 a.m. and the Parking is right off of Walden St. Walden charges to park a their lot ($5) via a computerized parking attendant that takes cards. I'd recommend the annual pass if you think you're going to come to more meetups. Alternatively,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?saddr=Concord+High+School,+concord+ma&amp;daddr=915+Walden+Street,+Concord,+MA&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=38.93711,-75.966775&amp;sspn=13.846355,14.128418&amp;geocode=FRa1hwIdrlO_-yEidG069HujIg%3BFQqXhwIdjYW_-ylB1q82q5vjiTFsmsu3RKWVtQ&amp;gl=us&amp;mra=ls&amp;t=m&amp;z=16\">It's a short distance from Concord High School<\/a>. Some people avoid the parking fee by parking near Concord High School and then walk\/ride their bike over to Walden.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mass.gov\/dcr\/parks\/trails\/walden.pdf\">Click here for the map of the parking<\/a>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/f\/f\/4\/event_118056852.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Across and back from the beach (Pictured above) is a little over a mile mile; a perfect distance for those training for 70.3 and Ironman races.<\/p> <p>There are also some close to shore routes for people getting better acquainted with open water (see distance maps). We meet near the lifeguard house right on the beach closes to Walden street. Here is the map of walden pond.<\/p> <p>This meetup is important because you always want to swim in groups if you can. Make certain that you look out for each other. Don't attempt to swim across the pond if you haven't trained for that distance. Always match up with someone or a group that swims your pace. The beauty of Walden is that you can swim very close to shallow water and get some good open water training in.<\/p> <p>If there are people that are looking to go long for the first time, let me know in advance and I may be able to swim angel, or get a swim angel group together. That way we can do it in a controlled and safe environment.<\/p> <p>For those that are really new and nervous about open water swimming, stay tuned for a beginners clinic that I'll put on in the summer.<\/p>",

The trails themselves are a mix of rolling, smooth, and rooted single and doubletrack that makes FANTASTIC riding. Plenty of climbs and technical challenges can be found, but the real high-point is the well-maintained and marked trails that go for miles with countless singletrack shoot-offs that re-merge onto the double track. One of the best rides in Massachusetts! You could ride here every day for a month and not experience everything.<\/p> <p>Contact me for carpool<\/p>",

[We'll be meeting First Saturdays unless a holiday (like Labor Day) moves us to the preceding weekend]. Our Meetups are fast-paced and entertaining. Not intimidating. You are welcome to participate in our two-minute impromptu speaking exercises, but certainly not required. We have a 30-second \u201cRound Robin\u201d that everyone participates in (it\u2019s fun and easy), and you\u2019ll probably be asked to introduce yourself [talk briefly about an interest, or what brought you there]. Pretty basic, no surprises.\u00a0 The only requirement is to enjoy yourself and get a sense of how the meetups run. [This session will <i>supplement<\/i> our usual Wed evening meeting, not replace it. Sessions start promptly, so please arrive a bit early.]\u00a0 Please rsvp.<\/p> <p><b>3rd Floor, Room 097.<\/b> You must take the elevator by the security desk to access the floor.<\/p> <p><b>Parking:<\/b> If you can't find street parking, there is parking to the rear of the bldg. You will present your ticket to the security desk on your way out ($3), then insert the ticket at the gate as you exit.<br\/>(Don't park in the supermarket\/Porter Square shopping center parking lot.)<\/p> <p><br\/>See the \"About Us\" tab for more info.<\/p> <p><br\/>NOTE: For those who like to plan far in advance, our next Saturday session will be a \"First Saturday\" (Oct 3).<\/p>",

Tentatively, we'll plan to meet at Porter Square. However, we'll see where people would like to meet, and different groups can meet in different squares. If you have a car, please let me know- anyone who is coming but doesn't have a car will contribute toward paying for gas and the $10\/car parking fee, and if you have a car, you come free. If you have a ZipCar membership, that works too. Walden's only a 20-30 minute drive away, so we should have plenty of time to explore.<\/p> <p>Bring plenty of water and a packed lunch! I can't promise there will be too many places we can stop while we're hiking.<\/p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you on Saturday!<\/p> <p>NEW RSVP POLICY:\u00a0Please RSVP if you plan to come. If you RSVP, I'll be waiting for you, so please show up! If you change your RSVP or ditch us within 48 hours of a meetup more than once per calendar year, we'll have to remove you from the group. \u00a0Two members have been dropped so far. \u00a0When you RSVP, you're making a commitment and taking a spot, so come.

We'll talk about the stages of manifestation so that you know (and <b>can celebrate<\/b>) that you're vision is becoming real.<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll also talk about fears and doubts... how to embrace them so that they serve your vision creating\/living process.<\/p> <p><br\/>It's time dear Superheroes to express yourself fully and live your dream. It's the ultimate act of self-love.... to <b>let yourself be you by creating what you're inspired to create.<\/b><\/p> <p>Are you willing to love yourself this much?<\/p> <p><b>==&gt; Refreshments &lt;==<\/b><\/p> <p>It's a party to celebrate you.

Players start-up and manage (or mismanage\u2026) railroads with the winning condition being money in the player\u2019s hands at the end of the game. These games are all long, heavy, and feature little randomness leading many to consider them some of the most rewarding games to play. For more information please visit the wikipedia page at (<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/18XX_games\"><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/18XX_games\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/18XX_games<\/a><\/a>) or the BGG Wiki page at (<a href=\"https:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/wiki\/page\/18xx\"><a href=\"https:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/wiki\/page\/18xx\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/wiki\/page\/18xx<\/a><\/a>). You can find a version of the rules for 1830 on the mayfair website (<a href=\"http:\/\/mayfairgames.com\/mfg-shop3\/rules\/MFG1830-Rules-V1_0.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mayfairgames.com\/mfg-shop3\/rules\/MFG1830-Rules-V1_0.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/mayfairgames.com\/mfg-shop3\/rules\/MFG1830-Rules-V1_0.pdf<\/a><\/a>) (focus on the 1830 classic rules) if you are interested in getting a head start.<\/p> <p>For this meetup, we will try and get somewhere between 2-3 games in over the session. Players of all skill levels are invited to join us and we are happy to teach new players the system as well as teach new games in the system (I am still fairly new to the system myself).<\/p> <p>PLEASE NOTE: Since the focus of this meetup is on longer games and the headcount limit is low (5 players\/1 table) please be considerate when RSVPing for this event. Please try to give notice to those on the waitlist if you expect to have to drop your RSVP. Additionally, since there is only one table and the games are long, please try to arrive on time, since 1 person late will delay the whole group.<\/p> <p>Please contact <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MetrowestBoardGaming\/members\/12309799\/\">Dave M<\/a>\u00a0(click the link, then click \"Message\") for the address\u00a0as well as any other information.<\/p>",

Have you had a desire to learn how these swords were used in combat during the Renaissance era? Much more than shouting \u201cEn Garde!\u201d and assuming a guard stance; competent warriors fought with systems that included various ways to attack and defend, footwork, timing, and even rules of dueling, all based on a sophisticated understanding of body mechanics, mathematics and philosophy.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/9\/d\/600_440793949.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The 16th century was a period of change for the sword. No longer relegated to the battlefield; the sword changed as its wear became commonplace in society. Blades slimmed and guards became more elaborate as the sword evolved into a nimble thrusting weapon worn by commoner and noble alike. As a result, a number of fencing schools opened to capitalize on their growing popularity. The golden age of rapier study dawned around 1550; numerous masters publishing fencing system manuals over the century to follow, with topics including rapier, off-hand companions such as the dagger, buckler and cape, long sword, quarterstaff, pole arm, dagger alone, and grappling.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/e\/600_440793934.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Our six-week Novice Rapier course will introduce the basic techniques and vocabulary of rapier fencing, enabling students to begin their study of period combat and the Art of Defence. The course will be taught by Charles and Robert, rapier scholars and Schole of Defence instructors.\u00a0 No prior training needed; all class equipment is provided.<\/p> <p>We invite you to come join the scholars and combatants of our Schole!<\/p> <p><i>(The price shown is for the set of all six classes [August 22, 29, and September 5, 12, 19 and, 26] and membership and registration.\u00a0 Classes are not offered separately.\u00a0 Class materials will be sent via email before the first session.)<\/i><\/p>",

Thus, if you fall in love with paddle boarding and want to continue to go, it would be easy to do for less time and less cost. Based on our experience, 2-3 hours is way more than enough.\u00a0<\/p> <p>*After you RSVP you MUST call Cape Ann SUP and reserve your rental for this day.* Please ALSO remember that if you sign up and later decide cancel, that you should also remember to cancel your rental with Cape Ann SUP as well.\u00a0<\/p> <p>You can tell them it is the MeetUp group with RENEE. They will ask for your phone number; in the event that they don't let people go out due to weather they offer to call you beforehand.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will be meeting at the Essex location at 35 Dodge Street. You will come to a big parking lot and they will have a small set-up near the water.\u00a0Please try to get there by 12:45 PM. Come early, get your sunscreen on, etc. We are going out later in the day this time around because of the tide.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Remember, that if you RSVP and don't bother to show up, you will be marked as a NO SHOW. I don't care if you change your mind, even if it's at the last minute, just be polite enough to let me know. There's nothing that I hate more than waiting for people who never come.\u00a0<\/p> <p>PS I also have set the RSVP's so that people can not add others. This is because in my experience small groups of people will hold up the RSVP list and then not show or cancel at the last minute. If you want others to join they will need to join either North Shore Women's Group or Casual Kayakers first.\u00a0<\/p> <p>AS A CONDITION OF ATTENDING THIS MEETUP, YOU AGREE TO: Hold harmless, and indemnify the organizers and their relations and heirs, and all members and participants of the Meetup group from any and all claims for injury, illness, death, and\/or property damage including those caused by negligence, ignorance, inexperience and other reasons. You also agree to assume all mental, physical, financial, and\/or other risk associated with this meetup. Kayaking, camping, hiking, bicycling, and other activities pose inherent risks and dangers. Participation in these activities is voluntary and dependent upon your own personal judgment. As organizers we make no claims regarding any expertise for this outing. This is not a guided tour. In the interest of safety,\u00a0consuming alcohol before or during any Casual Kayakers event is not allowed.\u00a0Wearing of Lifejackets (PFD's) is required when paddling with this group.<\/p>",

The beef tips are raved about and the menu is varied to suit all tastes. I spoke with Zack who was warm and friendly\u00a0and\u00a0happy to offer separate checks and to allow for twelve members. I think this will be a fun break in the day for everyone. If you are bringing a friend, I now have it set up so that you may request a plus 1 to accommodate your guest. Do be prepared to tip between 18-20% in thanks to the staff. Arrive on time and if you change your mind in attending, go back to where you clicked yes and change it to no so that those on the wait list can move up. There is never any need to let us know why you can't attend or changed your mind as that is expected. Be on time so that we can all be seated at the same time.

The music room has a grand piano.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our first\u00a0meetup\u00a0went well (4 pianists, 2\u00a0violinists,\u00a02\u00a0violists, 1 clarinetist, and fans) so here we go again.<\/p> <p>NOTE:\u00a0 The date has been changed to the 29th.<\/p>",

Be sure to bring your favorite one :) If you rsvp \"yes\" and then have a change of plans please be sure to update your rsvp ahead of time so that you won't be counted as a \"no show\" and to allow for other members to attend since we have a limit on attendance. Thank you very much.<\/p> <p>Live in the Metrowest area and want to come to our events but they're too far away? Want to make some new friends, eat some good food and play some fun games in the process? Make some time on your calendar for Saturday night because we have the event just for you.<\/p> <p>While all games are welcome, here are some suggestions for tonight:<\/p> <p>American Mah Jongg -- whether you are a beginner or a seasoned pro, we guarantee that there will be a table (or two) for people to play and mingle.<\/p> <p>Cribbage -- a lot of people are picking up this game, because it is so awesome. Do you have a cribbage board? If so, be sure to bring it :)<\/p> <p>Sequence -- Have you played this game before? The rules are simple but I warn you that it is quite addicting.<\/p> <p>We'll be meeting at the Panera in Waltham. Panera offers an inviting setting to meet friends for a light meal and conversation. The bakery-cafe offers innovative salads and sandwiches, delicious baked goods and healthy frozen shakes.<\/p> <p>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW<\/p> <p>This event is free, but please support the group and the event location by purchasing a drink or meal while you are Panera. The food is very good, so it will be hard to resist!<\/p> <p>Please do not bring outside food or drinks into Panera.<\/p> <p>Note that due to limited space we may place a limit on attendees if too many people sign up (or cancel it if we don't get any at all!)<\/p> <p>HOW TO GET THERE<\/p> <p>Panera Bread is located at 1100 Lexington Street in Waltham -- in the Shaw's plaza near the corner of Lexington Street and Trapelo Road.

As the moon rises higher in the sky, you'll start to see the fascinating wildlife that emerges when the sun sets.<\/p> <p>This spectacular tour only occurs during the weeks of the full moon and is a special adventure you won't want to miss.

While in this state the\u00a0sound waves of the gong and bowls induce an extended state of effortless meditation\u00a0and relaxation that facilitates the movement of prana through the body and psyche for\u00a0healing. In this way, the gong is a tool that magnifies and focuses the power of the\u00a0yoga experience. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>We will finish with tea, treats, and joy!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please bring a thick blanket or cushion to lie on and a shawl to cover with!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cThe Gong is the first and last instrument for the human mind, there is only one thing\u00a0that can supersede and command the human mind, the sound of the Gong. It is the first sound in the\u00a0Universe, the sound that created the Universe. It\u2019s the basic creative sound. To the mind, the sound of\u00a0the gong is like a mother and father that gave it birth. The mind has no power to resist a gong that is\u00a0well played.\u201d \u00a0-Yogi Bhajan, Master of Kundalini Yoga<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Yoga &amp; Gong: Guruatma Kaur: An IKYTA certified teacher and devoted student of Yogi Bhajan,\u00a0Guruatma Kaur has been enthusiastically teaching Kundalini Yoga since 1979. She is lovingly\u00a0dedicated to encouraging clarity, excellence, and relaxation into one\u2019s True Self.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Gong:\u00a0 Dharam Singh began an exploration of sound as a saxophonist and flutist in the Bronx, NYC - an environment immersed in the rich music and culture of Africa by way of the Caribbean, Boriqua, African American and the counter culture, which gave him a multicultural perspective on musical language. \u00a0 His passion for the transformative power of sound and music has found a place in the use of the Gong as he came to develop a unifying aural language that removes the separation between Head and Heart, Body and Soul. It is these frequencies, tones and harmonics, already given by Nature that he simply lives to share.\u00a0 Dharam is a long time student of Yogi Bhajan and a resident of Guru Ram Das Ashram, where he is the go-to guy for anything related to Gong Yoga, including buying one -\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.gongsongs.com\/\">www.gongsongs.com<\/a> He is part of the 'three-some' that leads the monthly Full Moon Gong event\u00a0<\/p> <p>Meditation: Siri Tapa Kaur, a Reiki Master, Sat Nam Rasayan Practitioner, and\u00a0certified Kundalini Yoga Teacher lives a life committed to being healthy, happy, and available to\u00a0all.

Then we'll return to shore, light the fire pit and enjoy toasted marshmallows and fine conversation.<br\/>We have canoes\/kayak for eleven.

For the past 20 years, Niaz has been working on advancing the rights and ecological benefits of the small-scale fishing communities as a means of protecting global marine biodiversity. NAMA works with small and medium scale fishermen on policy alternatives and market transformation strategies that support traditional fishing communities to have the smallest ecological footprint and the biggest food system, economic and social impact. In winter 2007\/2008, NAMA and the Port Clyde, Maine community pioneered the Community Supported Fishery (CSF) model, which has since grown to 50 + across the Americas and Europe through the localcatch.org network. Before joining NAMA, Niaz served as the Interim Chief Operations Office for the Healthy Building Network, and began working with small-scale, traditional, and indigenous fishing communities in the U.S. and from around the globe as a Greenpeace oceans and fisheries campaigner. Time Magazine named Niaz as a Hero For The Planet for this work. Her fisheries articles appear regularly in Fishermen\u2019s Voice and SAMUDRA as well as a range of random publications. Niaz\u2019 work and approach have been noted in a number of books including Against the Tide, Deeper Shade of Green, The Spirit\u2019s Terrain, Vanishing Species, The Great Gulf, Swimming in Circles, A Troublemaker\u2019s Teaparty and The Doryman\u2019s Reflection. She is a graduate of the Rockwood Leadership Program\u2019s Leading From Inside Out as well as Art of Leadership trainings. She serves on the executive committee of the National Family Farm Coalition and Granite State Fish, as well as on the core team of Food Solutions New England.

The weather for Sunday looks great so let's go first thing in the morning. We will start at Quincy Market, then head to the waterfront and end up at the North End where you can catch some of St. Anthonys Feast.\u00a0<\/p> <p>There you can join the parade, have some pastries from Mikes or enjoy some\u00a0great Italian Sausage Sandwiches from the street vendors. Best of all there will be plenty of fascinating subjects for you to practice your street photography after we warm up our skills in the other two locations.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Many of you have been asking for a class on how to photograph people. And some of you have been avoiding this topic.(You know who you are.) This is your chance to learn the secrets of how to creatively photograph total strangers on the street.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/6\/8\/7\/600_441330343.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>Marching Band getting ready for the North End Feast last year. Telling me to watch that camera angle. No shooting from the ground up.<\/i>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Photographing people, strangers, friends, family, is a skill we should all strive to develop. It is a wonderful part of being a photographer, to be able to capture moment of beauty as people enjoy the simple pleasures of life. I hope you will join us to hone your skill.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>This special workshop on street photography will introduce you to a step by step method for gaining confidence in photographing people. This is a essential skill for travel photographers, family photographers, and anyone interested in capturing the ordinary moments of life in a way that tells a story.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/6\/6\/a\/600_441330314.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>Quincy Market birds eye view.

You will be given specific photo assignments designed to build your skills step by step. I will provide handout cards so you can practice the assignments again after the class.<\/p> <p>We will be shooting people in three different city settings so please wear comfortable shoes and pack lightly so you can be on the move.\u00a0<\/p> <p>After class there will be social time where we will take a look at the photos of the day and give each other constructive critique. I highly recommend you plan on joining us for this part of the workshop. We will find a spot for \"refreshments\" near the third assignment location.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/e\/c\/600_401952012.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>Photo by participant Guy Lafontaine during recent Photographing strangers workshop.

        "description": "<p>This venue honors Charles River Boating as well as Boating in Boston season passes. \u00a0Some may have purchased groupons or living social coupons for either of these places.<\/p> <p>We'll paddle the waters of Boston Harbor at Carson Beach which can be reached by Red Line or car. <b>Please bring cash.<\/b> We'll learn the basics on shore then plan to put them in the water for 1 to 1.5 hour which is plenty of time for a workout and to learn all you need to know.\u00a0If you already know how to kayak, you are welcome to join us too. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>After we kayak, we can relax on the beach, walk. \u00a0Also, there is a fast take-out place at Castle Island (about a 25-30 minute walk) where you can get food and \u00a0or ice cream). \u00a0Food served at a reasonable price include hot dogs, hamburgers, fish, fries, onion rings... \u00a0There are bathrooms\/changing areas available on the beach.<\/p> <p><b>Park in the Carson Beach Lot or on Babe Ruth Avenue or take the Red Line (best way) to JFK and walk 9 minutes to McCormick Bathhouse, Carson Beach, South Boston.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>If there is a wait for kayaks, some will start kayaking while others watch from the beach or walk Castle Island. Then, the second group will go out while the first group watches or walks. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Single kayaks are $15\/hour; tandems are \u00a0$20. \u00a0We may have to take tandems if there are no more singles available.<\/p> <p>If you have any questions, \u00a0can post in comment section.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/0\/4\/600_398359972.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Kayaking is easier than canoeing and much safer than it has been in the past.

New sand, new walkways, benches, lighting, shade shelters and award winning landscaping have helped to make Carson Beach a popular destination. The recently renovated Edward J. McCormack Bathhouse, one of the first facilities completed as part of the \"Back to the Beaches\" effort, has restrooms, changing rooms, showers, drinking water fountains, chess tables, and bocce courts. In addition, it hosts first aid and lifeguard functions. \"Mother's Rest\" and its fishing pier have also been rehabilitated, making for a beautiful picnic area with a fantastic view of the Harbor.<\/p> <p><b>HOW TO KAYAK<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>STEP 1 Gear up<\/p> <p>Choose a kayak suited for learning. A sit-on-top model is best for beginners and what we'll be using. Wear a life jacket.<\/p> <p>STEP 2 Get in<\/p> <p><br\/>Step into the kayak, crouching to keep your center of gravity low, and quickly sit down. On a beach, lay the paddle across the cockpit and rest one end on the sand to steady the boat as you get in.<\/p> <p>Lean back comfortably in the seat as you paddle. This will help the boat stay stable.<\/p> <p>STEP 3 Paddle<\/p> <p>Hold the paddle with an overhand grip, thumbs under, and dip one side into the water. Pull down and back with one hand while pushing forward with the other hand. Dip the paddle straight in and pull it back even with your hips. Then dip the other side.<\/p> <p>Paddle with a smooth, rhythmic motion. Use your torso muscles and sit up straight without leaning into your strokes.<\/p> <p>STEP 4 Turn<\/p> <p>Paddle on only one side to turn the kayak in an opposite direction. Or use the paddle like a rudder, dragging it on the side you want to turn toward.<\/p> <p>STEP 5 Practice falling out or turning the kayak over in water<\/p> <p>Strap the paddle to a kayak, then grab the middle of the kayak. Kick to pull yourself onto a sit-on model, which are the easy ones we'll be using.<\/p> <p>STEP 6 Watch conditions<\/p> <p>Be aware of water and weather conditions. Paddle at an angle to the wind until you're near the shore before continuing.<\/p> <p>STEP 7 Know the rules and your limits<\/p> <p>Learn the rules that determine right-of-way on the water. Give the\u00a0right of way\u00a0to less maneuverable watercraft.<\/p> <p>STEP 8 Get out.<\/p> <p>Use your balance and take your time.<\/p> <p>Remember: Your Event Organizers are volunteers.

        "description": "<p>I've always wanted to experience a Cacao Ceremony, and they are having one in Salem! This is also posted in the Evolving Beings Meetup. Price: $30<\/p> <p>Chocolate! One of the greatest medicines on the planet! When ceremoniously consuming cacao, it creates an open heart and the sensation of falling in love. Sit in silent meditation if you want, dance away stress, stretch and expand yourself! Cacao is a super food; especially beneficial for the heart and brain. The ceremony begins with setting your intention. As the Cacao takes effect, you will be soaking in some sounds of the hoop drum, chanting, the didgeridoo and the singling bowl. Then you are invited to play instruments, dance, meditate, converse with new friends, draw, or just absorb the energy. The heart opening effects last one-four hours! Eat a light meal before the ceremony, and drink lots of water during and after the ceremony. This event takes place the morning after the full moon...so we can also bask in full moon energy.<\/p>",

Sit in silent meditation if you want, dance away stress, stretch and expand yourself! Cacao is a super food; especially beneficial for the heart and brain. The ceremony begins with setting your intention. As the Cacao takes effect, you will be soaking in some sounds of the hoop drum, chanting, the didgeridoo and the singling bowl. Then you are invited to play instruments, dance, meditate, converse with new friends, draw, or just absorb the energy. The heart opening effects last one-four hours! Eat a light meal before the ceremony, and drink lots of water during and after the ceremony. This event takes place the morning after the full moon...so we can also bask in full moon energy.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/1\/e\/3\/600_440145539.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

Each part lasts approximately 30 minutes.<\/p> <p>The Healing Service gives you the opportunity to receive healing energy that is channeled through one of our Healers. We believe that healing can be channeled through thought to those who need it. This is a very calming experience, whether or not you choose to sit in a healing chair.\u00a0 We encourage you to send healing to your loved ones, our communities, and Mother Earth.<\/p> <p>The Lecture covers a variety of topics ranging from the History of Spiritualism to Inspired Insights. It also includes examples of how Spiritualism is a part of our lives on a daily basis.<\/p> <p>Mediumship, or Spirit Communication, is the part of the service where a medium proves that \"...the existence and personal identity of the individual continue after the change called death.\" The medium might be a member of our church or visiting from another the Spiritualist church in the community. We also have mediums from abroad stop in often. While there is only enough time during a service for a few people to receive messages from their deceased loved ones on the Higher side Side of Life, everyone present benefits by witnessing proof of the continuation of life.<\/p> <p>At the conclusion of the service everyone is invited to our social hour downstairs for coffee and conversation.\ufeff<\/p>",

We will be creating\u00a0cohesive\u00a0paths from point a to b with focus on transitioning from skill to skill and making each run as efficient as possible.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What if I've never done anything like Parkour before?\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>This class, Parkour 101, is a introductory level class. We will be focusing more on learning how to move our body, understand our limits and get a solid understanding of how to train safe rather than jumping straight into super-high level flips and jumps.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What if I'm a gymnast\/marine\/stuntman\/etc? I don't want to be bored.<\/b><\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement. It's very common to in the same class have one student working on perfecting their roll, and on the other side of the room have another student practicing very high-level acrobatics. They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/b><\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous. We accept cash or card day of.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Anything else?<\/b><\/p> <p>These jams will be run outdoors, and with existing architecture. While we won't be getting into anything crazy, injuries are to be expected. Scrapes happen. We will have first aid available, but make sure you are thinking clearly and in your limits before training!\u00a0<\/p> <p>I am available to answer all questions, but I hope to see a whole bunch of you out in a few weeks!!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Be sure to check us out on:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\"><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/7\/5\/600_437965461.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

Very scenic, all bike types welcomed, all flat pavement. This is on a trail but we will cross many street crossings so be mindful of the person in front of you in the process of stopping, esp me lol. We will bike into Cambridge area as well near the MOS. I think this will be about 17 miles.\u00a0Bear with me cause I haven't done this trail in a while and one intersection confuses me.<\/p> <p>As always bring plenty of water, snack, pump up your tires, and wear your helmet. I will do a quick reminder the night before in email so make sure your email is connected with this bike meetup cause someone said they didn't get my last email. Hoping for another beautiful day.

        "description": "<p>Welcome to the fantastic kingdom of fungi. In this fascinating workshop you learn how to grow edible mushrooms in your own backyard!<\/p> <p>The workshop will cover techniques for growing mushrooms on logs, totems, stumps, and wood chip beds. Willie will discuss methods of finding and preparing materials for inoculation, different methods and tools used for inoculation. After the demonstration, everyone will get to dig into their own log! All participants will go home with an inoculated log ready to fruit mushrooms. Willie Crosby has been studying and growing fungi for the past four years. He started Fungi Ally, a mushroom cultivation and education business based out of Amherst MA. Currently, Willie grows about 100 pounds of shiitakes and oysters a week. He studied with Aloha Medicinals two years ago learning aspects of indoor cultivation and lab technique. Willie has taught over 50 workshops in Massachusetts and surrounding states on mushroom cultivation.<br\/>Light appetizers (mushroom themed!) will be served, bring a bottle of wine to share if you would like. Bring a folding chair for the demonstration.<\/p> <p>Join KCG at the this FUNdraiser to bring healthy eating and cooking to all. The cost of the event is $65 for one person, or $100 for two.<\/p> <p><br\/>Please consider making a further donation to Kids Cooking Green to support programming for underserved communities.

PLEASE look on the website each week for confirmation. THANKS!<\/p> <p><br\/>To get to the Meetup, take the RED LINE stop OUTBOUND TO ALEWIFE, and stop at PORTER SQ. Look down the street. There's Tavern in the Square! If you're driving, you can park on the street for free on Sundays!<\/p> <p>Anyone who loves ASL is welcome to come and be part of the fun! We want to warmly extend an invitation to Deaf people or others fluent\/skilled in the language (CODAs for example) to join our group.<\/p> <p>This is an easy-going, casual, ASL get-together to meet people who enjoy American Sign Language, who want to brush up on their signing skills, and want to learn more ASL by using it as often as possible.<\/p> <p>We strive to have a good time and communicate without using voices. If we need to, we draw or write what we don't know how to sign, and if lots of folks show up, we split up into small groups and mix and mingle, so we can actually see one another clearly, face-to-face and get a good conversation going.<\/p> <p>Don't be afraid or shy if you're not \"perfect\" at ASL, because being \"perfect\" is not the point of this group. No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.<\/p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again. This isn't an ASL class, since none of us are certified ASL teachers, so there's really <i>no<\/i> pressure or expectation--other than that we all use ASL to communicate. We all learn from one another!<\/p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL\/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language<\/i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs<\/i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!<\/p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged<\/i><\/b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating. We have lots of resources that we can suggest for learning ASL from a qualified teacher or authentic source, such as books, online classes, and local classes at various locations near Boston.<\/p> <p>If you can, \"officially\" RSVP, even if the RSVP is \"No,\" so that we know who is definitely going to come.<\/p> <p>It will be great to see folks!<\/p> <p>Erika and Jack<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This is an ongoing weekly (donation only) class for anyone, offering experiential practice in meditation, along with an opportunity to be among others interested in deepening spiritutual practices. \u00a0The class provides you with a felt sense of your own divinity; your Higher Self. The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening. Bringing the flow of light into the body\/mind\/heart means we more consciously embody our Light Being, so we are more present, happy, forgiving, peaceful and joyful while in the world.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0After the guided portion we\u00a0spend time\u00a0in peaceful silence.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you are an experienced meditator or a beginner, you will love the sweetness and powerful energies of this group. At the end of the class we make time for questions or sharing. \u00a0Group meditation is powerful, and it's refreshing to be among fellow travelers!<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0Judy also teaches the Sound and Light meditation; a way for you to draw your senses inward to open your spiritual eye and to hear the sounds of your chakras.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0This practice is non-denominational, appropriate for anyone.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0Held in a lovely healing space, just walking in will bring you instant peace.\u00a0 All are welcome.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0 You may also want to check out my other Meetup, for a variety of spiritual programs: \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings<\/a><\/a>\/<\/p>",

You hear that a lot from adults, particularly those of us with healthy relationships with their inner child :) But somehow, someone is minding the store in their lives. So what are the hallmarks of maturity in this day in age? What does it mean to be a mature adult today vs 50 or 100 years ago?\u00a0 Has technology made us less mature by taking away adversity and enabling instant gratification?\u00a0 What effect, if any, has telecommunications had (TV, internet, phone vs letter writing skills)?\u00a0 Cultural differences? Will the pendulum swing with future generations looking back at us calling us a bunch of whiny babies?\u00a0 What does maturity mean to you, and (ahem, bold introspection) in what ways do you see it, or see it lacking, in yourself?<\/p> <p>Join us for a \"mature\" (or not) discussion of what it means to be all growed up.<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there :)<\/p>",

We will then relate these methods to how we use networking to find or build a cooperative business with like-minded people. The panel can also answer questions or pose tips to help us all break out of our regular mindset about networking and find ways to reach out to those that might have relevant info for you, and those that may need info you have -- without becoming a pest:) We will discuss how to cross pollinate and meet people out of your current network that may have similar goals. Advice will be given on trying new or different networking techniques and perhaps we will share some funny stories of networking gone awry:)<\/p> <p>1. How to create campaigns that reach the right targets and send the right message.<\/p> <p>2. How to keep up with cooperative news and events.<\/p> <p>3. What type of events should you attend?<\/p> <p>4. How to use skills you probably already have to network.<\/p> <p>5. What tools are needed to network today?<\/p> <p>6. How to help others network for you?<\/p> <p>7. How do deadlines for print Advertising affect networking?<\/p> <p>8.

However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup. Therefore the number of RSVPs reflected here are NOT the total number of men or women registered.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups. Please note that many people opt NOT to RSVP through Meetup for privacy reasons.<\/i><\/b><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>NUTSHELL - every week\u00a0day, 12:15ish until 1:45ish, Cumnock Turf Fields\u00a0at Harvard Stadium, games of 4v4 up to 10v10 or larger depending on who shows, bring a white shirt and a dark\/colored shirt (but not a gray one), almost never canceled, read\u00a0below for more details before asking questions that are answered here, and read the comments for today's meetup to see if there is\u00a0anything important\u00a0about today.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\"><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT - Harvard Square is the closest T stop (red line). \u00a0Check Google Maps or other to find fastest way there from wherever you are.<\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY RIDE SHARE - a lot of players in this meetup come by car and are nice enough to offer rides to others. Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Intersecting, overlapping, not-quite-what-they-seem lives. Jealousies and betrayals and wounded hearts. A haunting unease that clutches and won\u2019t let go. All this and more helps propel Paula Hawkins\u2019s addictive debut into a new stratum of the psychological thriller genre. At times, I couldn\u2019t help but think: Hitchcockian. From the opening line, the reader knows what they\u2019re in for: \u201cShe\u2019s buried beneath a silver birch tree, down towards the old train tracks\u2026\u201d But Hawkins teases out the mystery with a veteran\u2019s finesse. The \u201cgirl on the train\u201d is Rachel, who commutes into London and back each day, rolling past the backyard of a happy-looking couple she names Jess and Jason. Then one day Rachel sees \u201cJess\u201d kissing another man. The day after that, Jess goes missing. The story is told from three character\u2019s not-to-be-trusted perspectives: Rachel, who mourns the loss of her former life with the help of canned gin and tonics; Megan (aka Jess); and Anna, Rachel\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s wife, who happens to be Jess\/Megan\u2019s neighbor. Rachel\u2019s voyeuristic yearning for the seemingly idyllic life of Jess and Jason lures her closer and closer to the investigation into Jess\/Megan\u2019s disappearance, and closer to a deeper understanding of who she really is. And who she isn\u2019t. This is a book to be devoured. -Neal Thompson<\/p>",

Use a GPS if possible. MetroRock is in a building opposite Boston Coach.\u00a0\u00a0 If you don't have a vehicle, the gym offers a shuttle service from nearby Wellington T Station; call the gym\u00a0for schedule details.<\/p> <p><i><b>Q)<\/b> I've never climbed at MetroRock Gym before, what do I need to do?<\/i><\/p> <p><b>A)<\/b> You'll need to take and pass a belay test for rope climbing. There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>",

The peace and tranquility he hopes to find, though, is anything but, once he agrees to being accompanied by the only person he can find willing to join him on the trek - his long lost and former friend Katz (Academy Award nominee Nick Nolte), a down-on-his-luck serial philanderer who, after a lifetime of relying on his charm and wits to keep one step ahead of the law - sees the trip as a way to sneak out of paying some debts and sneak into one last adventure before it's too late. The trouble is, the two have a completely different definition of the word, \"adventure\". Now they're about to find out that when you push yourself to the edge, the real fun begins.<\/p> <p>In theaters September 2<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.walkinthewoodsmovie.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.walkinthewoodsmovie.com\/<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/cOF2LIAp9bw\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/cOF2LIAp9bw<\/a><\/p>",

The silent sitting is interspersed with some meditation instruction, perhaps a brief reading, a little simple inquiry, exploration or movement. Sitting posture is relaxed, either on a meditation cushion or a bench. It's not a rigid practice- move whenever you need to!<\/p> <p>We meet every Monday night, 7:30 pm at the Cambridge Friends Meeting House. The Friends Meeting House is located at 5 Longfellow Park, Cambridge, MA 02138 You can find a very good map here:\u00a0&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.fmcquaker.org\/FMC-Map_2006.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/fmcquaker.org\/about-friends-meeting-at-cambridge\/directions\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/fmcquaker.org\/about-friends-meeting-at-cambridge\/directions\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Parking is available after 6:00 in the loop off of Brattle St. that leads to the Friend's House, and there is a small lot in back of the Friend's House for those with limited mobility. After that, parking is a little tricky in Cambridge (lots of \"resident only\" signs), but you will find available parking on Mount Auburn St. near Friend's House and on Brattle St. as you head away from Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>Coming by the T is a great option, with the Friend's House being a lovely 15 minute walk out of Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>If you find you are running late, come anyway! The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",
