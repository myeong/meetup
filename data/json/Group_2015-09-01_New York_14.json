So, weather your a developer, investor or VR enthusiast we want to let you know that we are here and that we don't bite (too hard).<\/p>\n<p>Shoot us an e-mail us at <i>pornVRhub.com&nbsp;<\/i><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/3\/3\/highres_439817203.jpeg","photo_id":439817203,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/3\/3\/600_439817203.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/3\/3\/thumb_439817203.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":189710345,"name":"Robert Doyle"},"members":45,"name":"Virtual Reality and The Adult Industry","id":18742125,"state":"NY","urlname":"Virtual-Reality-and-The-Adult-Industry","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Tenafly","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1436912220000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"stress-relief","name":"Stress Relief","id":17075},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"dance-and-movement","name":"Dance and Movement","id":34160},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Shake-Your-Soul-The-Yoga-Of-Dance\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Are you looking to move your body in such a fun way that will help you stay committed to your workout once and for all?

Since its launch in December 2008, Global Zero has grown to include 300 current and former heads of state, national security advisers, military commanders, and business, civic and faith leaders -- and nearly half a million citizens worldwide; developed a step-by-step plan to eliminate nuclear weapons; built and international student movement with 170 campus chapters in 25 countries; and produced a documentary film,&nbsp;Countdown to Zero, with the Academy Award-winning team behind&nbsp;An Inconvenient Truth.<\/p>\n<p>Nuclear weapons have no place in the 21st century. The ability to completely annihilate populations, infrastructure and the environment doesn't make us safer or more secure. They do not address today's security needs and siphon precious financial resources from the things that do. The threat of nuclear annihilation is real. 20 years after the end of the Cold War, 1,500 nuclear weapons are still on hair-trigger alert, ready to launch in minutes and wipe major cities off the map. Nuclear weapons kill indiscriminately. They violate international humanitarian law, and do not make us safer. Any nuclear accident or attack would have catastrophic and irreversible consequences on the environment. Even a \"small\" regional nuclear exchange would cause a nuclear winter, which would cause a global famine, killing approximately 2 billion people. And every day, terrorists are working to build, buy or steal a nuclear weapon. In the last two decades there have been at least 25 instances of nuclear explosive materials being lost or stolen. Those threats are real, and it's scary.<\/p>\n<p>Its members understand that the only way to eliminate the nuclear threat \u2013 including proliferation, nuclear terrorism and humanitarian catastrophe \u2013 is to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, secure all nuclear materials and eliminate all nuclear weapons: global zero. The movement combines cutting-edge policy development and direct dialogue with governments with public outreach, including media, online and grassroots initiatives to make the elimination of nuclear weapons an urgent global imperative.<\/p>\n<p>As residents of NYC, we have and continue to be a target of terrorism. But we can take action to avoid a nuclear weapons incident! There are no insurmountable technical barriers to global zero, nor are there financial ones. The only barrier is political: it's a matter of the leaders of the nuclear powers acting with urgency and resolve. It's our job to muster the necessary public pressure and political will to make that happen - with hundreds of world leaders, Global Zero's bold campaigning, and the power of our grassroots movement we know we can reach Zero.<\/p>\n<p>If you agree with me, or at the very least curious about what I'm talking about, I urge you to attend this very important conversation.

We are advocates, nurses, therapists, teachers, friends mothers to our children, but we all need a moment to relax, talk, vent out and most importantly be understood. &lt;br&gt;I am creating a group where moms like me can meet once a week: have coffee, go to a spa, dinner, movies, talk and cry together. Though we might have great friends and family in our lives it is not the same to share our daily experiences. This group is open to any race, religion and background. I live in union county and I welcome anyone from New Jersey to be part of this new group. Together we can make each other stronger, share our resources, give advice. No judgement, no gossip, no discrimination. I look forward in meeting you all!!The location is Union but meetings will be held in different locations around Union county! Please feel free to contact me with suggestions, questions or concerns.

Just like driving a car it becomes second nature over time, but you must practice, practice, practice! This is a free group; what I learn I like to share with others, because it helps me become a better photographer. We can all learn from each other, share tips, and support each other in our efforts to become better photographers. If you don't try, you can't fail, and if you don't fail, you can't learn. Let's get together and make it happen! Join us for events, and 1 on 1 sessions; we will be visiting various locations in NYC, as well as participate in seminars, and exhibitions.

I am hoping for each of us to find friendships that lift us up, make us better, support us and celebrate all of lifes mini milestones!

A group that gets to know each other so well that each of us feel safe sharing, laughing, teaching and learning. A group that encourages even the most timid of us to be slightly more adventurous. A group that can be about nothing and then about everything...trips, outdoor activities, game nights, great books, museums, potlucks, wine bars, good food, and even a little fitness.<\/p>\n<p>I have included a 30 day free trial.

Everything seems normal for you but if you start questioning the things that happens like the loss of MH370\/MH17 Malaysia Airlines, 9\/11, GMO Foods from Monsato etc. then you'll see the real structure.&nbsp;It's not only about figuring out where the New World Order (NWO) is activ but also to figure out what we can do as a single person to make a difference. Even small actions can be helpful. We should find our way back to what we really are.. no customers - we're humans with personality! &nbsp;Advantage for us; &nbsp;NWO needs our '(in)direct' participation, if enough of us would wake up and deny, that would result that their plan can\u2019t operate! <br><\/p>\n<p>The world is slowly and secretly going forward to become an united New World Order. Have you heard from Bilderberg group? Very few rich people have power on <i>every<\/i> activity. <br><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re being poisoned by harmful chemicals like Fluoride, Aspartame, MSG etc., feed with harmful GMO Foods like Soy and Corn and many other chemicals and toxins. Are you happy with that as it is? All these things can cause cancer, brain damages, problems with reproduction etc!!! The more we eat it, the more the risk rises for those diseases! Don't take it easy with that, we could have better options - it's right now all about companies profits - even with stores like Whole Foods! If possible you should really stop eating fast foods from McDonald's etc. not only because of Trans Fats but because it's crammed with harmful chemicals.<\/p>\n<p>Children getting vaccination which are fully poison for the body! Soon, everyone all over the globe is about to get RFID Microships implated in their arm or on their forehead, which will include ID, everything concerning your health as well as bank accounts. Again to have control on our daily life and if you would then start to rebel against the system, worst thing going to happen; they'll delete your access to money = you can't purchase anything anymore... We might see that in future actions from the Elite.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>other topics can be f.e.<\/p>\n<p>- Finance \/ Bank System - f.e. planned Financial Crisis to steal money from the population<\/p>\n<p>- Social changes - f.e. head down society, slavery, loose of YOUR privacy, don't you see more and more homeless people on the street? Companies are reducing and replace jobs with robots to make that process speed up. You wanna know why? There is a Guidestone in Georgia saying;&nbsp;Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature. This is the work of those people who want to rule and control the world.

How do we dissolve the seeming separation between the world of spirit and the \u201creal world\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>I am here simply to share with you my knowledge and experience and to create safe, sacred space for each of you to reconnect to the medicine\/answers\/wisdom\/truth within yourselves and with each other. I offer you a connection to a community of like-hearted beings who are offering their wisdom and tools to advance the whole on this path of awakening.<\/p>\n<p>I believe in transparency and honesty because we all carry the medicine within. Each of us has a unique and equally important gift to offer. Everyone has vision. Everyone holds a special space in the circle of ceremony, in the larger circle that is Life. <br>There are no secrets on the path to awakening. There is only truth, and that truth is for everyone to share.<\/p>\n<p>I envision a life for myself and others where we wake up each day feeling connected, guided and at ease. Feeling real and true to who we are and what is passing through us. Feeling clear and with a sense of purpose. <br>I envision a life of being awake. Awake all the time, not just when working with the medicines. Living the awakeness to the Truth. The Truth that: I AM Whole, I AM Love, I AM Free.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What will be offered?:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-We will come together as a community to learn about and share our experiences with sacred plants and to share our work and gifts with others. &nbsp;This can happen both online via webinars and in-person via live events and workshops. <br>-Webinars to prepare participants before medicine ceremonies so they feel grounded, open and at ease before arriving at the ceremony. We will do group meditations, review the preparation recommendations and ask questions to express and clear up any potential confusion or concerns. <br>-Webinars to integrate after the ceremonies. We will do group meditations, share our personal experiences, offer tools and exercises that can be done daily to assist the unfolding of what you experienced with the medicine, and answer any questions participants may have. <br>-Alternate resources that have powerful healing tools that can be practiced daily to continue the awakening process in our everyday life or between the ceremonies. <br>-Opportunities to connect one-on-one or in a group setting to catalyze personal healing. <br>-Access to virtual and live events all over the United States and Canada. <br>-Access to shamanic and energy healing practitioners. <br>-Access to educational information about healing plants, foods, and products. <br>-A place to be heard, seen, and supported.<\/p>\n<p>Who am I? <br>My name is Rachael Devon Rios Sessions. I have come to this work via my own transformational journey and self-seeking. I began my work with the medicine about 6 years ago. I dove in head first after my first ceremony experience, which awakened within me an undeniable knowing that my work with sacred plants was much bigger than my own. I have worked with many wonderful teachers, but my most profound teachers to date have been my late-husband Ramon Orlando and our two beautiful boys, Rafael and Rey. Ramon passed away suddenly in his home country of Colombia last year but continues his work as shaman and taita (teacher) from the world of spirit. We shared many dreams for the expansion of the work with these sacred tools as a vehicle for the awakening of every being. I aim to humbly continue the work we began together and I trust in the guidance and vision I am offered. Besides being a full-time mama, I am a facilitator and organizer of sacred ceremony as well as a shamanic practitioner, Reiki master, yoga teacher and BodyTalk practitioner.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/0\/7\/highres_440357671.jpeg","photo_id":440357671,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/0\/7\/600_440357671.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/0\/7\/thumb_440357671.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":103391762,"name":"Rachael"},"members":154,"name":"AYAM Healing with Plants","id":18780380,"state":"NY","urlname":"AYAMHealingwithPlants","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438121636000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"urban-planning","name":"Urban Planning","id":18839},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"cities","name":"Cities","id":69931},{"urlkey":"smart-city","name":"Smart City","id":72764},{"urlkey":"sustainable-cities","name":"Sustainable Cities","id":146918},{"urlkey":"smart-cities","name":"Smart cities","id":205341},{"urlkey":"civic-engagement-technology","name":"Civic Engagement & Technology","id":728662}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Procurement-2-2-Transform-the-way-cities-solve-problems\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Join us if you are passionate about cities, think that public spending should be more open to new solutions and that cities should be amazing problem-solvers.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":128652852,"name":"Sascha Haselmayer"},"members":40,"name":"Procurement 2.2 - Transform the way cities solve problems","id":18780723,"state":"NY","urlname":"Procurement-2-2-Transform-the-way-cities-solve-problems","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438130825000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"gay","name":"Gay","id":447},{"urlkey":"Lesbian","name":"Lesbian","id":742},{"urlkey":"gaypros","name":"Gay Professionals","id":4270},{"urlkey":"lgbtfriends","name":"LGBT","id":10050},{"urlkey":"black-lesbians","name":"Black  Lesbians","id":17290},{"urlkey":"lgbt-social-group","name":"LGBT Social Group","id":17665},{"urlkey":"gay-men","name":"Gay Men","id":19558},{"urlkey":"bisexual-women","name":"Bisexual Women","id":21737},{"urlkey":"african-professionals","name":"African Professionals","id":26747},{"urlkey":"african-culture","name":"African Culture","id":35648},{"urlkey":"africans","name":"Africans","id":140632}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LGBT-Coalition-of-Africa\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group is for Africans who identify as part of the LGBT community.

The nonprofit organization now has nearly 270,000 members in more than 13,000 clubs in 110 countries, offering a proven \u2013 and enjoyable! \u2013 way to practice and hone communication and leadership skills.<\/p>\n<p> Most Toastmasters meetings are comprised of approximately 20 people who meet weekly for an hour or two. Participants practice and learn skills by filling a meeting role, ranging from giving a prepared speech or an impromptu one to serving as timer, evaluator or grammarian.<\/p>\n<p> There is no instructor; instead, each speech and meeting is critiqued by a member in a positive manner, focusing on what was done right and what could be improved.<\/p>\n<p><b>Why Join?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Survey after survey shows that presentation skills are crucial to success in the workplace.

Actors must have a good grasp of the inner workings of the character they must portray and the psychological skills necessary to generate and fully inhabit roles which they may not have experienced in their their own lives. Psychology and, in particular, psychodynamic approaches (Freud,&nbsp;Jung, Erikson, Phillips) provide a deep understanding of emotion and behavior that can help you create more richly nuanced characters and improve your acting technique. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is a roundtable workshop and discussion group for actors, screenwriters, filmmakers, and others in the performing arts who wish to gain psychological insights to improve their character-building skills. At each meeting we will discuss a different emotion or aspect of the human condition in the context of psychoanalytic principles that provide insight into the fundamental drives and conflicts that direct our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will examine emotions and behaviors and relate them to character-building frameworks such as Uta Hagen\u2019s Nine Questions, the&nbsp;Michael Chekhov method, Stella Adler's techniques, and conceptual frameworks such as Freud\u2019s model of the mind. We'll share and examine our own experiences and gain insights into our behaviors and those around us. These insights, and your ability to creatively adapt them, can improve your ability to build realistic and unique characters.<\/p>\n<p>Examples of topics we will cover in individual workshops:<\/p>\n<p>* Greed<\/p>\n<p>* Jealousy and Envy<\/p>\n<p>* Stage self vs. Real Self<\/p>\n<p>* Anxiety<\/p>\n<p>* Depression<\/p>\n<p>* Grief<\/p>\n<p>* Addiction<\/p>\n<p><span>8\/28\/15: Stay tuned for the date of our first workshop in mid\/late-September.&nbsp;<\/span><br><\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/3\/a\/8\/highres_440638280.jpeg","photo_id":440638280,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/3\/a\/8\/600_440638280.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/3\/a\/8\/thumb_440638280.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":319487,"name":"Matt"},"members":53,"name":"Actors' Psychology Workshops","id":18811508,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Actors-Psychology-Workshops","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438984032000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"offleash","name":"Off-Leash Dog Recreation","id":9753},{"urlkey":"activedogs","name":"Active Dogs","id":9772},{"urlkey":"dogs","name":"Dogs","id":15067},{"urlkey":"dog-parks","name":"Dog Parks","id":17407},{"urlkey":"dog-play-groups","name":"Dog Playgroups","id":18340},{"urlkey":"hiking-with-your-dog","name":"Hiking with Your Dog","id":26756}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/People-who-look-like-their-dogs\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Do you have a dogpelganger?

Maximum effectiveness and efficiency in order to neutralize the opponent as quickly as possible. Maintaining awareness of surroundings while dealing with the threat. Learning to understand the psychology of a street confrontation, and identifying potential threats before an attack occurs This meetup group is for anyone who would like to learn Krav Maga. We can get together to learn Self Defense against any real world dangers and counter in the quickest and most efficient way. The intensity of these workouts will keep you physically fit, develop awareness and build confidence over time. I have asked a friend, David Ordini to show us some of the basics of Krav Maga. We can meetup once a week and learn self defense from a 9 year Krav Maga student who studied under the grand master.

That said, Telerik gives us the opportunity to hold three different meet-ups, where you will gain an extremely high-level perspective of the NativeScript runtime; however, if demand for this meet-up is low, we will be forced to condense it into one meet-up, which will be a deep-dive on NativeScript.<\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The time and place of NYC's Summer of NativeScript meet-ups will be announced in the upcoming weeks, so be sure to join to stay updated on any new information!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Below, I have attached the material used thus far for Summer of NativeScript meet-ups.

Now flash forward. Those simple games filled with sprinting and fast movements have been replaced with idleness, jogging and other slow-twitch movements. It's time to change that. In fact, the only people who should perform low-intensity cardiovascular exercise like jogging are those who need to lose muscle tissue. To maximize your body composition and performance, sprinting is the modality of choice. A well-designed sprint program \u2014 that's where we come in \u2014 will significantly reduce body fat, increase work capacity and reaction time and develop your posterior chain (the fancy term for glutes and all the other muscles on the back of your leg) like that of a world-class athlete.

While there are plenty of groups for kids and teens, older adults and even parentless parents, the \"young adult\" age range has been highly overlooked by bereavement support groups. Meanwhile, I have found it hard to relate to both people who lost parents in their teens or middle age; on the one hand, I had an adult relationship with my mother, but I also feel she will never get to see me finish \"growing up\" completely. On top of that, young adults are often living the most transitional, independent portions of their lives. Most of us here in NYC live away from family and our oldest friends, we are building careers, still figuring out who we are, experiencing the dizzying ups and downs of dating, and living in impermanent homes either alone or with strangers. My goal is to create a group who knows what it's like to be amidst the chaotic flows of young adult life while grieving the loss of a parent. This group is not so much based on age as it is what stage of life you feel you are in. If the above resonates with you, you are more than welcome to join. It does not matter how you lost your parent, or even if you are simply coping with a sick parent whom is still alive. Meetings will be casual, simple, fun, and relaxing -- a picnic at the park, a cool little restaurant, a warm bar, etc., and I strongly encourage all members to make suggestions. I just want to meet some new friends who are also figuring out how to live a good life under the heavy weight of grief, to hang out and heal in good company.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":26293692,"name":"Chelsey"},"members":11,"name":"Young Adults Who Have Lost a Parent","id":18823049,"state":"NY","urlname":"Young-Adults-Who-Have-Lost-a-Parent","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Badasses"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439306769000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"sealliance","name":"Social Enterprise","id":6613},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"social-innovation","name":"Social Innovation","id":21808},{"urlkey":"green-entrepreneurs","name":"Green Entrepreneurs","id":23538},{"urlkey":"social-entrepreneurship","name":"Social Entrepreneurship","id":26643},{"urlkey":"socially-conscious-enterprise","name":"Socially Conscious Enterprise","id":73593},{"urlkey":"socially-responsible-business","name":"Socially Responsible Business","id":78007},{"urlkey":"social-impact","name":"Social Impact","id":113871},{"urlkey":"helping-social-enterprises","name":"Helping Social Enterprises","id":139926},{"urlkey":"helping-non-profits","name":"Helping Non-Profits","id":139927},{"urlkey":"non-profit-leadership","name":"Non Profit Leadership","id":1113482}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Entrepreneurship-New-York\/","rating":0,"description":"Call all Social Entrepreneurs!

I thought to myself, maybe I should try Craigslist. The moment I started to comb through Craigslist for a roommate I got overwhelmed and simply gave up. I couldn't tell who was authentic or who was a bot. The first emails I sent left me bombarded with spam.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>I tried two other sites that I will not mention here because it is not important but they could not deliver what I was expecting. Plus, the ritual of going back and forth instead of simply meeting and deciding within a short time and move on with my live was taking too much time. The frustration got to me and if you are here I believe you share this frustration. I have good news for you however. We can take the reins and take back control. Who says we need a third party to find you a roommate.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>This meetup will serve to find to find, professionals like yourself, &nbsp;a roommate that meets your expectations. The success of this meetup will be in direct correlation to your commitment in showing up and participating. Basically, do not waste my time as I will not waster yours.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>The format of the meetup will be the same each week and will be as follows:&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>1. Pre-populated Questionnaire \u2013 You will only have to do this once and given that your criteria for a roommate does not change you won\u2019t have to do this ever again&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>2. First 10 minutes - Chat or mingle or whatever you New Yorkers want to call it.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>3. Then 20 minutes of \"algorithmically\" matching you up with a roommate. Basically, I will use the information from the questionnaire to match you up with a few people and you get to decide if you want to talk with this person or not.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>4. Then another 25 minutes of you walking over and talking to someone that you think might be a great roommate.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>5. 5 minutes wrap up. You get to hear the success stories of people who found their roommate for that session.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/5\/2\/highres_440841330.jpeg","photo_id":440841330,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/5\/2\/600_440841330.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/5\/2\/thumb_440841330.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":11996088,"name":"Alfie Walker"},"members":8,"name":"Roommate Matchup for Professionals - New York City","id":18826991,"state":"NY","urlname":"Roommate-Matchup-for-Professionals-New-York-City","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Alfie"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Astoria","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439407332000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"poker","name":"Poker","id":254},{"urlkey":"cardgame","name":"Card Games","id":9792},{"urlkey":"texas-hold-em","name":"Texas Hold 'em","id":16947},{"urlkey":"poker-tournaments","name":"Poker Tournaments","id":24471},{"urlkey":"mens-poker-nite","name":"Men's Poker Nite","id":26689},{"urlkey":"poker-sit-n-gos","name":"Poker Sit-n-Go's","id":32259},{"urlkey":"poker-cash-games","name":"Poker Cash Games","id":32260},{"urlkey":"poker-players","name":"Poker Players","id":36255},{"urlkey":"no-limit-texas-hold-em","name":"No Limit Texas Hold 'em","id":37206},{"urlkey":"poker-lovers-meetup","name":"Poker Lovers Meetup","id":39857},{"urlkey":"texas-holdem-poker","name":"Texas Holdem Poker","id":41406},{"urlkey":"poker-night","name":"Poker Night","id":41407},{"urlkey":"private-poker-club","name":"Private Poker Club","id":42491},{"urlkey":"texas-holdem-poker-tournaments","name":"Texas Hold 'em Tournaments","id":46861},{"urlkey":"poker-home-games","name":"Poker Home Games","id":50791}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/vippokercub\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><b><i>What our Meetup Group is about?<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>A Group Dedicated To Weekly Queen's Poker Game Meetups &amp; Discussions.<\/p>\n<p>Members can meet to network and play poker with other members in the Queen's Area<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Who should join our group?<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>Experienced &nbsp;professional poker players looking for games to &nbsp;in the Queen's area.<\/p>\n<p><i><b>Why they should join?<\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p>To meet fellow local poker players and see flops!<\/p>\n<p><b><i>What members can expect?<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>Professional high quality poker games and players in Queen's.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Contact Information:<\/p>\n<p>Phone (917) 651-9778<\/p>\n<p>Email: 11101underground@gmail.com<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/vippokerqueens\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/vippokerqueens\/<\/a> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9100036621,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/a\/8\/highres_440841672.jpeg","photo_id":440841672,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/a\/8\/600_440841672.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/a\/8\/thumb_440841672.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":139313242,"name":"Billy Mendola"},"members":32,"name":"Queen's VIP Poker Club","id":18827160,"state":"NY","urlname":"vippokercub","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Rounders"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439411717000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"Lesbian","name":"Lesbian","id":742},{"urlkey":"lgbtfriends","name":"LGBT","id":10050},{"urlkey":"road-cycling","name":"Road Cycling","id":17259},{"urlkey":"cycling","name":"Cycling","id":18617},{"urlkey":"lesbian-friends","name":"Lesbian Friends","id":21736},{"urlkey":"lesbian-social-networking","name":"Lesbian Social Networking","id":36427}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Queer-Womens-Cycling-Club\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>There are many great women's cycling groups in NYC, but this one will focus on the LBTQ community.

Feel the warmth of the tea. Can you smell it? Can you smell it?\" ...or you may have had your fill of \"gurus\" who may direct scenes, but don't give actors any understanding of how to get where they need to get--on their own! Well we are launching a NEW workshop on Sept. 24th called \u201cThe Life Acting Workshop\u201d where we don't have any gurus. We focus on each member putting up work in an atmosphere of helping one another using a simple and effective system called \u2026LIFE ACTING...with an emphasis on ON CAMERA work. Life Acting is summed up in the question: \u201cWhat does your character want from the other actors\/characters and how are you going to get it? At the current time, we are limited to 10 committed actors. The experience level is not the key issue here, but the willingness to make a commitment to the work. Each workshop is only $25. The initial one will take place from 7pm to 10pm on Thursday, September 24th My goal for this is to develop an encouraging and safe place to work and improve our craft as actors. I am serving as the facilitator. Not a guru.

Our meetups will be held on Tuesdays, Thursdays and some Saturday's between the hours of 6-9pm in Bronx Park East (across the street from the Mobile gas station in the outfield of the baseball field or by the light posts), but that is subject to change depending on the groups availability. As we know, the summer season will be ending but I will do my best to keep my games going (and if not make a different type of meetup for the winter months) within the Bronx or upper Manhattan for all my Bronx people. I have traveled to Ultimate Frisbee meetups in the city and dealing with the travel time (1-2 hrs), rush hour (sardines on a train OR traffic), and no shows (not even a single \"hey games cancelled today\"), was a bit too frustrating for me. For this reason I decided to make a meetup where people from the Bronx do not have to leave their borough, and so that people who live a bit more downtown do not have to deal with to much traffic and be able to enjoy a perfectly good frisbee game with like minded individuals. With that being noted, I will surely send notifications if ever I will not be attending an event or in the case of any unfortunate event. I will also bring my own 175g Frisbee, cones, rules (which are subject to change) to all events but you are more than welcome to bring your own as well. If you are new to the rules of ultimate Frisbee here is a website so that you can brush up on them (I know I need to do so as well): <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usaultimate.org\/resources\/officiating\/rules\/default.aspx#10simplerules\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.usaultimate.org\/resources\/officiating\/rules\/default.aspx#10simplerules<\/a> IMPORTANT NOTE: Please RSVP if you will be attending, and notify if you will not be able to make it if you have already RSVP. This helps to avoid any waste of my time and your fellow members time. Currently, I have played in Bronx Park East, but I am in the process of waiting on a permit from NYC Parks so that I can use the field without any problems in the future.<\/p> \n<p>If you have any questions, comments or concerns please feel free to message me at anytime. Thank you.<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/3\/0\/highres_440883888.jpeg","photo_id":440883888,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/3\/0\/600_440883888.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/3\/0\/thumb_440883888.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13355180,"name":"Kevin Negro'n"},"members":25,"name":"Bronx Ultimate Frisbee Meetup","id":18829783,"state":"NY","urlname":"Bronx-Ultimate-Frisbee-Meetup","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Frisbee Players"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439489267000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"wine","name":"Wine","id":611},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"new-york-city","name":"New York City","id":16809},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"dinner-theater","name":"Dinner Theater","id":21880},{"urlkey":"live-theatre","name":"Theater","id":23274},{"urlkey":"dinner-and-a-movie","name":"Dinner and a Movie","id":23778},{"urlkey":"new-york-city-events","name":"New York City Events","id":26546},{"urlkey":"singles-over-40","name":"Singles Over 40","id":33722},{"urlkey":"singles-40s-50s","name":"Singles 40's - 50's","id":61916},{"urlkey":"single-professionals-45","name":"Single Professionals 45+","id":68229},{"urlkey":"over-45-active-singles","name":"Over 45 Active Singles","id":70774},{"urlkey":"dinner-enjoyed-with-friends","name":"Dinner Enjoyed With Friends","id":435222},{"urlkey":"new-york-singles-over-45","name":"New York Singles Over 45","id":1506095}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Upscale-Singles-over-45-Dining-Out-and-More\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><b>Welcome and thank you for your interest. New York Upscale Singles Meetup is for Singles over 45 who enjoy fine dining as well as sports, theater, movies, wine-tastings, dancing and other fun social activities.<\/b> We meet roughly once or twice a month (usually Saturday evening) at some of the best restaurants in New York City. &lt;br&gt;<\/p> \n<p><b>PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT A DATING CLUB! WE ARE A SINGLES OVER 45 FRIENDS CLUB! <\/b> &lt;br&gt;<\/p> \n<p>It is ALSO important to note that most restaurants and other experiences offered in this group will be in the $100 per person AND MORE range, so, if this isn't your budget range then we probably won't be a good fit for you. There is no fee to join, but, there is a $1 non refundable holding fee for ALL restaurant events. This is done for two reasons: to make sure you actually wish to attend and aren't just RSVPing without reading about the event and what to expect and second it helps weed out non-participating members. So many Meetup groups have tons of members and only a small percentage that actually participate. This method helps reduce non participating members - we do a sweep of members every 3 months. If you are inactive for 3 months you will receive a warning notice. If you are inactive after 6 months you will be removed from the group. (That's fair, right?) &lt;br&gt;<\/p> \n<p>If we attending the theater or a movie or other activity that requires prepayment.

All my life I was a skinny in shape person (134 lbs). Ten years ago injured my feet and could no longer run. I would lay on a couch from the minute I came home from work until I had to go back.

So here is what I want to do:<\/p> \n<p>I figure after the summer is over and everybody goes back to work, I would like to start a morning exercise (PT) group, that would meet, Monday thru Saturday in the morning. We will start very slow, super duper slow, and over the course of time build ourselves up and lose weight at the same time.<\/p> \n<p>We motivate each other and as we do it each day, and as time goes by it will become easier and feel less awkward. Like the lottery, you got to be in it to win it.<\/p> \n<p>Here are a few ideas that I have as I live in Spyten Duyvil. We can either meet in Van Cortland Park, Inwood Park or at the base of the Henry Hudson Bridge and make our way over to Inwood park. Or we can do Palisades Ave for a very slow start and build up over time to a full throttle.

Some of us have been using HubSpot for years, some of us run marketing agencies, and some are just starting to learn about Inbound. If you love networking and exploring new ways to grow your business, join us for a meetup!<\/p>\n<p><b>Do I have to be a HubSpot User?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Nope! In addition to current users, we welcome anyone interested in learning more about HubSpot or Inbound Marketing in general. That said, our agenda will typically include a deep-dive into some aspect of the HubSpot tools, or a customer case study.<br><\/p>\n<p><b>Is this Going to be a Sales Pitch?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>No! The sole purpose of a HUG is to get together and learn the best of HubSpot from one another. A basic tenet of Inbound Marketing is understanding that people hate being sold to. We earn trust through education.<br><\/p>\n<p><b>What's a Typical HUG Agenda Like?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>All HubSpot user groups follow a similar agenda, which includes networking, an educational presentation, and a group discussion. At least twice each year we'll also have guest speakers from HubSpot headquarters join us! Our meetups are casual, helpful, and provide members with complimentary food, drinks and HubSpot SWAG.<br><\/p>\n<p><b>What Should I Bring to the Meet-Up?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Business cards for networking, something to take notes (Wifi will be available, if you want to bring a laptop or tablet), and an open mind for learning and sharing.<br><\/p>\n<p><b>Can My Company Host a Meet-Up?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Absolutely! One of the more challenging aspects of meetup planning is finding space, so if your company can accommodate a group of 30+, let's chat. We require a location our members can get to easily via major subway lines, high-speed Wifi, a large presentation monitor (or a large screen and laptop projector), enough space for networking, and the ability to bring in food and drinks. In exchange for your hospitality, we'll include your logo and link to your site on our registration landing page, as well as social media promotion.

This meetup is only for RC Airplanes and unfortunately no Quadcopters or Drones. I own and enjoy some myself, but the reckless use of these had shed a negative light on the hobby and there are other groups for that.

I will play several instruments to relax you and inspire you. <br> <br>I seek to activate your 6 senses. I will offer organic vegan friendly cacao tea and oils to activate the senses accordingly. Very minor adjustments of shoulders before during or after to those who ask. Sage &amp; Palo Santo may also be used. <br> <br>My sonidos curanderos will help wash away all stress, worry and discomfort and the vibrations within our space will unlock your imagination. Together, through breath and sound, we will create a perfect sound-scape; a sonic, phonic arena for your spirit to travel to and through. I invite you to join me and my fellow NY Sonic Shamanic alchemists as we travel with the mind, body and spirit by being present w stillness and contributing a steady thorough breath. <br> <br>Guy Douglas \"The Gong Man\", \"DEEP Exhale\"\/LA and \"Sonic Shamanic\"\/LIB-DoLab-SoCal. are my soundscape progenitors; and what I contribute is a nexus of deep rooted tribal vibrations and an oscillation of fluid, elastic, Cosmic pulsations. You will be raptured by the sounds of a Live Native American flute, Didgeridoo drone pipe, Ocean wave drum, Crystal &amp; Tibetan singing bowls, rain monsoon tower, thunder-maker, serpent rattle, and a sometimes (as inspired) very special Sun language orison; a vernacular tongue which you may surprisingly recognize.

My own friends and loved ones do share some of my musical taste - but how many times can I drag them to see Brandi Carlile, Damien Rice, Gregory Alan Isakov, Amos Lee, Ray LaMontagne, The Decemberists, Lord Huron, Wilco - and so on?? \n\nI've seen you super fans at many shows - you have the same look of bliss on your face that I do - and I wana connect :) So - lets join forces, share upcoming show info, maybe go to shows together, maybe just grab coffee and talk about the music - share experiences, etc... Let's do this!","lon":-73.7799987793,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":41685752,"name":"Kristy Lynn Staniszewski"},"members":51,"name":"Fans of singer songwriters, live music, & WFUV public

We know that Bernie Sanders is the ONLY candidate that is going to improve the quality of life for people of color in this country. And it\u2019s on us (black people) to share this message with our family, friends and communities. We need to organize and mobilize from now through November of 2016. We started African Americans for Bernie (#AAFB) to accomplish this very goal. We know there are a lot of black folks that are supportive of Bernie, but so far, we only exist online. We want to step from behind the screens for a moment and get together in person to meet one another and talk. There are a lot of events coming up, rallies, conferences, so we want to pull everything and everyone together and talk about we can all do together to help get Bernie Sanders elected. We are meeting on Monday, August 24th at 6:30 at Negril Village at 70 W 3rd St between Thompson St and Laguardia Place in Greenwich Village. *Everyone has different talents and gifts and we need all of them!

I created this group with the intention to meet with other like minded individuals who like me are looking to grow and expand, emotionally, financially and spiritually. Our meetings are going to take place twice at month the 1st and the 3rd Wednesday of each month from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM. During our meetings all members are going to have the opportunity to share, to make questions and discuss current experiences, problems or any other life event they my be facing with the intention to seek deeper understanding, clarity and a possible solution.

Yoga is great for relieving stress, dealing with anxiety, getting in shape and attuning to self awareness. The word yoga means \"union\" and often refers to uniting the breath and the body through breathing exercises and \"asana\" which are the postures used in the physical practice of yoga. And while connecting to our inner self is super important it's also essential to connect the world and people around us!

Our group has been rehearsing and performing for Long Island audiences for 52 years! We rehearse every week with our brilliant, talented and energetic Co-Directors, Christine Krowles and Connie Kash. They teach us our songs in many ways, for the different ways we learn, and help us to sound and look our best. If you like to sing, and would like to learn about barbershop singing, please give us a call. We rehearse every Thursday night from 7:15 until about 9:45 at the Good Shepherd Lutheran Church on Hempstead Turnpike in Levittown. Our chorus is not affiliated with the church - we just rent space. We invite women who want to learn about this great hobby to visit us most any Thursday.
