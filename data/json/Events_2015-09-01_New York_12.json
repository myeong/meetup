It remained in his family for half a century until it was bought by Reverend Martin in the 60\u2019s who established the castle as a religious retreat.<\/p> <p>In 2005 the castle was purchased by a group of German investors and was opened to the public allowing visitors from all over the world to view a castle that had always been shrouded in mystery and as rumor would have it \u2013 haunted.<\/p> <p>This trip covers an eleven mile section of the St. Lawrence River not offered in any of our other tours. Our experienced tour guides provide a lively narrative during both the down river trip to the castle and return trip back to Alexandria Bay directing your attention to points of interest and sharing historic, environmental and seaway facts.

Brief individual notes will be given, if that's what you're looking for, and tailored to your level of experience. At the end of each class, I'm confident you'll feel a sense of accomplishment that will leave you more energized and excited to tackle the challenges of everyday life, whether at your work place or in your personal life.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>This class is free. \u00a0But there is a suggested donation of $15 or whatever you can afford to help cover the room rental and Meetup expenses. \u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Hope to see you there!<\/p> <p><br\/>Steve<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.improvnow.com\">www.improvnow.com<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/improvnow\">www.facebook.com\/improvnow<\/a><\/p> <p>Steve Ling is an alumnus of the improv programs of the Upright Citizens Brigade, Peoples Improv Theater, Magnet Theater, &amp; Annoyance Theater.

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>NEW Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>_______________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. So, at the very least give us\u00a03 days notice\u00a0that you will not be able to attend or in case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up past the 3 days notice, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a wait list, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels within the 3 days before the shoot, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\". Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away.

It is a form that covers every possible defense and counter attack we might find in a real confrontation, and trains our subconscious to react properly in such situations. It also strengthens our muscles, sinews and joints in order to be healthy to defend our life. The series of intricate and specific movements also trains the practitioner in the usage of the correct muscles to strike and to perform fajing (explosive energy). Needless to say, like any other training method in the system, it also improves our self-healing and our ability to heal others, by combining forcefully our mind\u2019s intent with our qi, and teach them how to work together. This is a form that was developed by Yang Shouzhong, Yang Cheng-fu\u2019s eldest son, in order to bring back the Yang energy element stripped in the simplifications made by his father to the original form.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nNote:<\/p> <p>These series of free classes are intended to show the both sides of the original Yang style: the \u2018softer\u2019 and internal, and the \u2018harder\/martial\u2019 and external. It will also elucidate the link between the both sides of the same coin - fajing. On one side, we train it slowly, in order to train the subconscious on how to recover that natural expression of energy, and to impart it with some sophistication that makes it more suitable for our higher-goals: self-healing and medical (healing others) work. On the other, we train on how to use it for self-defense purposes, and on how it can help give us the best chance of survival when our life is in true danger.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Contact info: 646-820-8653","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/WTBANYC\/events\/224695638\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":3600000,"name":"FREE LESSONS Small San Sau Self-Defense Form","id":"wkdbklytlbnc","time":1440950400000,"updated":1440956033000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1401724195000,"name":"World Taiji Boxing Association - New York City","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":14829442,"urlname":"WTBANYC","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07042","country":"us","city":"Montclair","address_1":"351 Bloomfield ave","name":"Pinot's palette","lon":-74.214958,"id":15111762,"state":"NJ","lat":40.811901,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.5479879379,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438112972000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello Ladies,<br\/>Welcome to Girlfriends in New Jersey!

Our core principle is to be competitive while maintaining a fun atmosphere.<\/p> <p><br\/>As a team, we strive for greatness and help our fellow teammates reach their full potential. The Badassilisks have competed in four World Cups to date and look to increase that number this year. To be a Badassilisk, you must be prepared to work hard and give it your all. Quidditch is a fun sport but it is also a competitive sport so we plan to work hard.<\/p> <p>The Badassilisks, however, are more than just a team. We are all friends and family. In addition to our practices and tournaments throughout the year, we hold social events so that teammates can hang out off the pitch as well and get to know each other and have fun.<\/p> <p>A Badassilisk is expected to uphold certain principles. On the pitch, a Badassilisk exhibits sportsmanship and never gives up. Off the pitch, a Badassilisk is respectful and helpful to both their teammates and other members of the community.<\/p> <p>All experience levels are welcome to come tryout. Whether you are a veteran player or new to the game, we would love to see you come to try-outs. If you are new to the game we will teach you the sport and train you to be a great player.<\/p> <p>*Note to current team members: Current team members must attend tryouts for the subsequent season to be considered for a spot on the team.<\/p> <p>**If you cannot make this tryout date, please get in touch with us and we can work out a new date that works better for you.<\/p> <p>Do you think you have what it takes to be a New York Badassilisk?

The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p><b>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/224853112\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Morningside Park","id":"gjrzflytlbnc","time":1440950400000,"updated":1440963575000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"42 W18th st","name":"Adorama","lon":-73.833504,"id":19342022,"state":"NY","lat":40.782001,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.4998216629,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438281492000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/1\/1\/8\/600_440348472.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>You\u2019ve seen them before, those portraits on the cover of magazines that make you stop and stare, an engaging portrait that is different than the textbook stuff you see everywhere.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Manhattan. Sunday, August 30th @ 1:00PM<\/p> <p>Gotham Yacht Club is looking for fun sailors and non-sailors to join us this weekend for one of the last trips of the season!<\/p> <p>We take trips around the Manhattan area in a 50-foot Beneteau. We usually sail the Hudson--the Statue of Liberty to the George Washington Bridge--but also go to Martha's Vineyard, the Hamptons and the Jersey Shore.<\/p> <p>We like to fill the boat up with about 20-30 people. No sailing experience is required, but preference is given to experienced sailors since the trips can\u2019t happen without them.\u00a0 As space is limited on the boat, simply RSVP\u2019ing \u201cYes\u201d to an event does not guarantee a spot on the boat.\u00a0 If a spot is available, you will be contacted directly with event details.<\/p> <p>Sailors can take their first trip to get acquainted and enjoy the party.\u00a0 From then on, sailors can choose to (1) work the morning shift and help out with the launch or (2) work the evening shift and help out with the return.\u00a0 Generally, sailors spend less than a third of the trip working and can take the rest of the time to relax and socialize.<\/p> <p>The current crew is made up of young, educated Manhattan professionals. We are looking to meet new people who will enjoy the atmosphere and company of everyone on the boat.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you and\/or your friends are interested, please copy, paste, and fill out the questionnaire below in an email and send to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>.

They generally last all afternoon into the early evening.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Q: Do I have to fill out the questionnaire?<\/p> <p><br\/>A: Yes!

And how a new developmental understanding of religion provides a pathway beyond more limited, fundamentalist orientation of faith.<\/p> <p>Ultimately, DiPerna provides a pathway for religion and spirituality to have a massively positive impact on consciousness, culture, and society.<\/p> <p>American Philosopher Ken Wilber has strongly endorsed both books stating: \"DiPerna's offering provides a series of brilliant first steps toward a vibrant trans-lineage spirituality... DiPerna's work fundamentally changes the way religion and spirituality can (and should) be practiced.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>Through Dustin's teachings we will:<\/p> <p>- Learn how a new developmental approach to religion opens the door for a deeper understanding of the current state of religion in the world<\/p> <p>- Discover a clear methodology for working with terrorism and other forms of religious fundamentalism<\/p> <p>- Learn how some expressions of religion can stand on equal footing with other rational forms of knowledge acquisition<\/p> <p>- Be re-introduced to the sacred, mystical path within each tradition that leads the way Home to Ultimate Reality<\/p> <p><br\/>The afternoon will consist of lecture, group discussion, as well as meditative and inter-subjective practice. If you are interested in learning more about spirituality, integral theory, or how to foster a deeper connection to Ultimate Reality in your life, this is an event not to be missed!<\/p> <p>-----<\/p> <p>Dustin DiPerna\u00a0is founder of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.brightalliance.org\/\">Bright Alliance<\/a>\u00a0and Co-Founder of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.synergyforum.org\/\">Synergy Forum<\/a>.\u00a0He is an author, group facilitator, and meditation instructor.

And it does not involve a lot of hard work! \u00a0First and foremost, you must realize that your success is intrinsically tied to your destiny. \u00a0In other words, you made an agreement before you were born to have certain experiences in life.\u00a0 Understanding this will help you to determine any unforeseeable roadblocks in your climb to the top.<\/p> <p>Next and most importantly, you must understand that striving for success by following a blueprint, attending a seminar, or listening to audio programs are great stepping stones but are not the key. \u00a0The real secret to success is in tapping into the most powerful force there is. \u00a0What is that force? \u00a0It is what we call the indwelling intelligence that resides within you. \u00a0It is your spirit. \u00a0If commanded or programmed correctly your spirit will work on autopilot to push you towards supreme success.<\/p> <p>Once the spirit has been given a directive it will guide you to the right people, places, and resources at the right time. \u00a0Some call this synchronicity.\u00a0 But since the spirit is all-knowing it can even give you information on the right sources to go to so that you can gain special favors, loans, or even fame.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, our society is hell-bent on promoting the idea that the attainment of success can only be achieved through hard work and\/or networking with the right people.\u00a0 However, the real truth is that your spirit, when programmed correctly, will manifest all that you need.\u00a0 But there is something that is even better.<\/p> <p>When groups of people come together for a single objective then they become truly unstoppable! \u00a0The more energy, the more power. \u00a0Each person will be given a special mantra to summon the chi or Ra force energy. \u00a0So please bring your goal written down so that the energy we\u2019ll be providing can be focused immediately. \u00a0The group will take turns meditating on each other\u2019s objectives. \u00a0Your goal will be super-charged with the powerful energy of the entire group, ensuring your unlimited success.<\/p> <p>This will also be an opportunity to gather with like-minded individuals and form lifelong connections. \u00a0Join us for this wonderful, inspiring event!<\/p> <p>This session will be dedicated to the Goddess Auset\/Isis. \u00a0Donations to our cause are always welcomed but never obligatory.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Project-Illuminated-Meetup\/events\/224890643\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Join The Winner's Circle with Qesankh Maa Kheperu","id":"224890643","time":1440957600000,"updated":1440989826000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1425788954000,"name":"Project Illuminated Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18485091,"urlname":"Project-Illuminated-Meetup","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Illuminated"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10003","country":"us","city":"NY","address_1":"53 East 8th Street","name":"Cosi","lon":-73.993305,"id":892675,"state":"NY","lat":40.730969,"repinned":false},"headcount":4,"distance":1.3290514946,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440453247000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>All righty.

In fact you have done too much to become unhappy. If you want to be unhappy, do too much. If you want to be happy, allow things, allow things to be. Rest, relax, and be in a let-go.<\/p> <p>Let-go is the secret of life. Let \u2013go is the secret of religion. Let-go is the greatest secret. When you are in a let-go many things, millions of things, start happening. They were already happening but you were never aware. You could not be aware; you were engaged somewhere else, you were occupied...<\/p> <p>Where are you going? And you think that somewhere in the future there is some target to be achieved? Life is already here! Why wait for the future? Why postpone it for the future?...<\/p> <p>For those you have attained to the here and now, the whole life starts showering flowers on them. Many things start happening which they never dreamed of. When for the first time you are really relaxed, in a meditative state, you cannot believe that life is so beautiful, so euphoric, such infinite bliss, such a sat-chit-anand; you cannot believe it! It is unbelievable...<\/p> <p>Open the windows, break the doors open! And run out of this imprisonment, stand under the skies. Feel again! Thinking won\u2019t help. Thinking can go on and on inside you without opening a single window. Only feeling brings you out of yourself \u2013 and you are so afraid of feeling, so much at ease with thinking and so afraid of feeling, because feeling will bring you out. It will bring you again into the very current of life. You will be in the river, moving towards the ocean.<\/p> <p>Feel more, think less, and by and by you will see that the more you can feel, the more relaxed you are.

I just ask that everyone who Rsvp's really do their best to show up, as you know I dont charge for this meetup, so come out see the hottest comedy show and maybe even make some new friends. this sundays line up includes the below.<\/p> <p><br\/>Damien Lemon, Ryan Reiss, Kyle Grooms, Ross Bennett, Mark Normand, Godrey, and who knows who might drop by usually its Amy Shumer or Judah Friedlander.<\/p> <p>I will be at the front end of the bar by the iphone charger to meet with everyone and give you tickets for free admission and have everyone sit together so we can all share laughs.<\/p> <p>Show starts at 8pm sharp so please be on time! We can also do 10pm so if you all would prefer that for the future let me know.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/8\/6\/600_441265478.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/funthingstodoinnyctoday\/events\/224851319\/","yes_rsvp_count":26,"name":"Myq Kaplan (Tonight show), Greer barnes added Comedy Central at Stand Up NY Free","id":"224851319","time":1440977400000,"updated":1441108504000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1217100557000,"name":"Alternative to the Bar Fun Things To Do In NYC Today!","group_lon":-74,"id":1235637,"urlname":"funthingstodoinnyctoday","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"NYers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10019","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"1792 Broadway","address_2":" (@ 58th St.)","name":"Argo Tea and Coffee","lon":-73.981679,"id":1276493,"state":"NY","lat":40.76713,"repinned":false},"headcount":11,"distance":1.26369154453,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1423377115000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We've planned this now as a weekly meetup, so that everyone in the group can get together even if the moderator can't be there.<\/p> <p>If Darren can't make it to introduce everyone (he can't this week), could someone please take it upon themselves to 1) stake out the big table a little early, 2) Lead a go-around-the-horn o? introductions at 8pm, and 3) Time the 60 minutes of writing time and let everyone know when it's 9 pm.<\/p> <p>As always,<\/p> <p>Please RSVP only if you can make it, and update as soon as possible if your plans change.

Be aware Argo closes at 10pm.<br\/>If you're spending too much time THINKING about writing, come and join us for a session of focused writing.

If you come late, we might have already started.<br\/>The music and occasionally nonmember conversation can be loud, so bring headphones too.<br\/>WiFi is available with purchase.<br\/>It's a little chilly, so if you get cold bring a sweater.<br\/>And it goes without saying that buying a cup of joe or a snack from Argo for being nice enough to host us will bring you good writing karma.<br\/>If you aren't sure you can make it, please don't RSVP! Come on time or even a little early, as it can be difficult to save seats.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/shutupandwriteNYC\/events\/224376260\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"duration":3600000,"name":"NYC Shut Up & Write Meetup! - Columbus Circle","id":"cxklflytlbnc","time":1440979200000,"updated":1441024610000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1284414674000,"name":"Shut Up & Write!

Apparently it seems most everybody just goes to Fire Island for the 4th, or stays for some time, then they all return home. The most charming aspect of this is hearing the old drag queens tell of days long gone, when Fire Island was the only place a gay person could fully come out and stay out--for as long as they were there. The charm of the place itself is summed up by one queen who says they have \"the beach, the bay and a bar in between!\"--that hilarious look when she says this really says it all.<\/p> <p>(Above excerpts from a reviewer on Amazon.)<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/hfhgA-icTAs\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/hfhgA-icTAs<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GAAMC-Meetup-Group\/events\/224741997\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Movie: \"Invasion of Cherry Grove\" & 20-Somethings discuss Online Dating","id":"224741997","time":1441060200000,"updated":1441073048000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1391294648000,"name":"GAAMC Meetup Group","group_lon":-74.4899978638,"id":12668242,"urlname":"GAAMC-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Members & Guests"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10014","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"224 West 4th street","address_2":"Second Floor","name":"fat cat fab lab","lon":-74.00296,"id":14148372,"state":"NY","lat":40.733955,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.30262732506,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1427153053000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Jeff Jassky wants to make your Monday better...with making!

He received an excellent education and a fine upbringing. From a very early age, he underwent mystical experiences which already indicated his exceptional destiny. For several years, he was the president of the New York Institute for Psychical Research, and was considered an authority in this field. In 1909, he made contact with the European leaders of the Rosicrucian Order. Having given proof of his integrity and of his knowledge in philosophical and esoteric matters, he was initiated in Toulouse, where he officially received the mission of reactivating the Order in America. Despite encountering numerous obstacles and difficulties, he carried out his mission well, and in conformity with the instructions that were given him by the Rosicrucians of France, he began to put into writing the Rosicrucian teachings. In order to demonstrate the traditional and authentic foundations of the Order, he made it known under the name, \"The Ancient and Mystical Order of the Rose Cross.\" In 1915 he was named Imperator, that is, the international leader. After having dedicated his entire life to the service of the Order, Harvey Spencer Lewis passed through transition on August 2, 1939.<\/p> <p>This work, which is dedicated to him, is presented so that you can discover his thoughts through his essays. Though written in the past century, their message is always fresh. They demonstrate the modern spirit and avant-garde nature of this great philosopher and humanist.<\/p> <p><b>All are Welcome!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/224382981\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Circle of Spiritual Inquiry - Master of the Rose Cross: In Thy Right Hand","id":"fpbtflytlbpc","time":1441060200000,"updated":1441073025000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10027","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"163 W 125th St","name":"Adam Clayton Blvd State Office Building Plaza","lon":-73.947243,"id":808144,"state":"NY","lat":40.80852,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.6302075386,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440039678000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Toastmasters-Meetup\/events\/224756656\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"The next meeting of Harlem Toastmasters is August 31, 2015. at 6:30PM.","id":"224756656","time":1441060200000,"updated":1441073049000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1409617412000,"name":"Harlem Toastmasters Meetup","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":16737912,"urlname":"New-York-Toastmasters-Meetup","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Toastmasters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10012","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"53 Spring Street","name":"Gatsby's","lon":-73.996551,"id":1040539,"state":"NY","lat":40.722319,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.94715678692,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437341194000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hope you can join us in August for the GBC August meeting.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We'll be reading a Man Called Ove this month. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1476738025\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1476740046&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwmeet0c-20&amp;linkId=5RNHPEFEKPPDGUJQ\">Check it out here.\u00a0<\/a><\/p> <p>We will be moving back to Gaby's for the month of August - unless the park works out really well in July.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Whether you\u2019re seeking to move up in your organization, looking for a new job, thinking about making a career change, launching a new business, wanting to attract new clients, or looking to scale your social impact, in today\u2019s rapidly-changing, hyper competitive working world a strong and consistent personal brand is key to creating new opportunities for your career or business.<\/p> <p>The truth is we all have a personal brand. It is how we are perceived by others - our friends, colleagues, and the public. It is what people think about when they hear our name and what people say about when we are not in the room. The key question we need to ask is: do we take charge of our personal brand or do we leave it up to chance?<\/p> <p>Personal Branding with Purpose is not about learning how to \"create\" a personal brand.

The only rock we eat, salt has shaped civilization from the very beginning, and its story is a glittering, often surprising part of the history of humankind. A substance so valuable it served as currency, salt has influenced the establishment of trade routes and cities, provoked and financed wars, secured empires, and inspired revolutions. Populated by colorful characters and filled with an unending series of fascinating details, Salt by Mark Kurlansky is a supremely entertaining, multi-layered masterpiece.<\/p> <p>\"Kurlansky continues to prove himself remarkably adept at taking a most unlikely candidate and telling its tale with epic grandeur.
