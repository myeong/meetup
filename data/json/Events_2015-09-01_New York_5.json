You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

But the Village's gay history goes back a century before that, to Walt Whitman's time. Like Paris' Left Bank, the Village has been the center of all of the city's many countercultures and artistic movements, from the Bohemians of the World War I period to the Beats, the Abstract Expressionists, the New York School, Pop Art, the creators of Off (and Off-Off) Broadway, and of course the gay liberation movement. We see the places where Villagers have lived and loved, including the sites of the drag shows and gay bars which have dotted the Village for 150 years. The list of LGBT greats we discover reads like a history of American culture: Herman Melville and Henry James, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Eleanor Roosevelt, James Baldwin, Allen Ginsberg, Andy Warhol, as well as a host of other famous names including gay icon Billie Holiday.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LGBT-History-and-Culture\/events\/224300421\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"name":"Explore the gay history of Greenwich Village","id":"224300421","time":1439505000000,"updated":1439781246000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286895187000,"name":"LGBT History and Culture","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":1720782,"urlname":"LGBT-History-and-Culture","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":2.14235806465,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1418024955000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>As it is always, the topic is a placeholder for the month's conversation.

I still love the game, and enjoy sharing what I can offer in a fast paced, enthusiastic, and supportive learning environment.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/morris-county-area-volleyball\/events\/220706108\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Volleyball Skills Clinic","id":"dctwclytlbrb","time":1439506800000,"updated":1439519558000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1273775906000,"name":"The Morris County Volleyball Meetup Group","group_lon":-74.4199981689,"id":1645063,"urlname":"morris-county-area-volleyball","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Volleyball Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","city":"New York","phone":"(212) 228-3269","address_1":"80 2nd Ave","name":"Cacio e Vino","lon":-73.988988,"id":672821,"state":"NY","lat":40.72642,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":45,"headcount":41,"distance":1.63349092007,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1435284982000,"rating":{"count":7,"average":4.86000013351},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/0\/2\/2\/600_439069186.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>$50 includes food, wine or beer, coffee, tax &amp; tip<\/p> <p>We will have the same menu, more or less, that we had last year at the Ferragosto celebration.<\/p> <p><i>Vincent<\/i>\u00a0(aka\u00a0<i>Vincenzo o Vicenzu<\/i>)<\/p> <p>PS: This Feast marks the start of the end of the summer.<\/p> <p>****************************************************<\/p> <p>Proposed MENU (you get everything listed below)<\/p> <p>Salad (individual plates with both salads)<\/p> <p>Cucumber Salad: with red onion, black eyed beans, tomatoes<\/p> <p>Spinach Salad: with mango, pecorino cheese, mint, in balsamic vinagrette<\/p> <p>Pasta (individual plates with both pastas)<\/p> <p>Spaghetti Cacio e Piselli: with pecorino cheese, green peas<\/p> <p>Rigatoni alla Norma: with tomatoes, eggplant, basil, salted ricotta<\/p> <p>Main Course Family Style<\/p> <p>Grilled Calamari: with sauteed zucchini, cherry tomatoes<\/p> <p>Sauteed Mussels: with garlic, tomatoes, pepper<\/p> <p>Main Course #3 (individual plate for each person)<\/p> <p>Breded Chicken Cutlet (Palermo Style): with arugula, cherry tomatoes, red onion<\/p> <p>Dessert:\u00a0tiramisu<\/p> <p>Coffee:\u00a0any style<\/p> <p>Red and White Wine or Beer or Soda<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/sicily\/events\/223507223\/","yes_rsvp_count":31,"duration":10800000,"name":"Ferragosto (aka The Assumption)","id":"223507223","time":1439506800000,"updated":1439840965000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1178522558000,"name":"New York City's Sicilian Food, Wine & Travel Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":495061,"urlname":"sicily","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Sicily Lovers (Siciliaphiles)"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":0,"distance":5.53888320923,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1394724239000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>*** \u00a0PLEASE RSVP ONLY IF YOU CAN COME ***<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nCome join us at our weekly Thursday night meetings to craft, chat and general merriment.

Valley.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to warn potential attendees up front that if you favor big, high-extraction, high-alcohol, high-tannin fruit bombs, you might give this dinner a pass.\u00a0 This is old-world winemaking in a northerly climate, where achieving full ripeness can be a challenge\u2014the resulting wines are subtle, sometimes austere, definitely intended to go with food rather than dazzle critics bestowing 100-point-scale ratings.\u00a0 (Or as Jancis Robinson says about the Clau de Nell Grolleau, \u201cinsider\u2019s wines\u201d that can be \u201chard work\u201d!)\u00a0<\/p> <p>A vast region of France falls into the category of \u201cLoire Valley.\u201d\u00a0 The Loire is the longest river in France, and the wine regions alongside it range from Muscadet at the mouth of the river, on the Atlantic Coast, to the Sauvignon-dominated Upper Loire, home of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fum\u00e9, more than 300 miles inland.\u00a0 In between are Touraine and Anjou, which produce a wide variety of white, red, ros\u00e9, sparkling, and sweet wines, usually unblended single-varietal wines with little or no oak influence, to highlight the grapes that grow best here.<\/p> <p>If I poured all the wines that I\u2019d like to include in a Loire tasting, the bottles would outnumber the attendees.\u00a0 So I decided to narrow the focus down to Touraine and Anjou, where I think the most distinctive wines come from.\u00a0 Nevertheless, I\u2019m going a bit overboard, with eight bottles plus a bonus dessert wine.\u00a0 I\u2019m undercharging a bit for this event, on the assumption that I\u2019ll be taking home significant leftovers.<\/p> <p><b>REGIONS AND APPELLATIONS (FROM WEST TO EAST)<\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Anjou:<\/i><\/b>\u00a0 Situated around the city of Angers, this region in the western end of the central Loire (far enough west to get some maritime influence) was long known primarily for rather undistinguished Ros\u00e9 d\u2019Anjou.\u00a0 But there are three noteworthy appellations in the region making white, red, and sweet wines.<\/p> <p><i>Savenni\u00e8res:<\/i>\u00a0 A tiny appellation making some of the world\u2019s best Chenin Blanc wines.\u00a0 Long ago it was made in a sweet style, but today almost all of it is anything but\u2014a formidably austere, concentrated, minerally dry wine that is often considered tart and unapproachable in its youth.\u00a0 Restrictive yield limits contribute to the concentration.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying an example from 2007, made by Damien Laureau, a rising star of the appellation.<\/p> <p><i>Saumur-Champigny:\u00a0 <\/i>A red-wine appellation created in 1957 to distinguish the wines from standard Saumur.\u00a0 It\u2019s situated on a plateau of well-drained, porous tuffeau rock and produces Cabernet Franc\u2013based wines that have become classic Paris bistro wines\u2014fruity, easy drinking, best drunk on the young side.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying a Saumur-Champigny by Clos Cristal, a historic property that is owned by the Saumur hospital (reminiscent of the Hospices de Beaune).\u00a0 A remarkable feature of this property is a set of stone walls with holes in them through which the vines grow, keeping the roots cool and maximizing sun exposure for the grapes on the other side.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/4\/4\/8\/600_440317960.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>C\u00f4teaux du Layon:<\/i>\u00a0 An appellation for sweet wines made from botrytized Chenin Blanc grapes.\u00a0 The appellation is large and quality is variable, but superior wines come from subappellations Bonnezeaux and Quarts de Chaume.\u00a0 The vineyards\u2019 proximity to rivers encourages the formation of \u201cnoble rot,\u201d and the best wines are labeled \u201cS\u00e9lection des Grains Nobles,\u201d meaning the harvest is done manually in multiple stages, with pickers only collecting rot-affected grapes containing concentrated sugars.\u00a0 We\u2019ll try a mature S\u00e9lection des Grains Nobles by Philippe Delesvaux.<\/p> <p><b><i>Touraine:<\/i><\/b>\u00a0 This is the very center of the Loire region, situated around the city of Tours, distinguished by a cool, continental climate and tuffeau soils.\u00a0 Here are the major appellations.<\/p> <p><i>Bourgueil:<\/i>\u00a0 An almost exclusively red appellation (a small amount of ros\u00e9 is produced) on the north bank of the Loire.\u00a0 Cabernet Franc is grown on gravelly soils on south-facing slopes, resulting in fairly ripe, fruity wines that, like Saumur-Champigny, are Paris bistro standards.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Chinon:<\/i>\u00a0 Across the river south of Bourgueil is Chinon, arguably the most famous of the Loire reds (although white and ros\u00e9 wines are made also).\u00a0 Styles vary with the terrain, with light wines coming from sand and gravel vineyards, and fuller-bodied versions from limestone slopes.\u00a0 All tend to feature an appealing combination of fruit and pencil-lead minerality.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Vouvray:<\/i>\u00a0 An ancient and highly respected appellation, producing world-class Chenin Blanc in a variety of styles, from bone-dry to sweet, plus sparkling.\u00a0 The area is situated on a tuffeau plateau interspersed with small rivers and streams that moderate the continental climate.\u00a0 The wines are long-lived and are a pure expression of Chenin Blanc fruit, with floral, apple, and beeswax notes\u2014neutral oak and steel are used, and aging is primarily in bottle.\u00a0 To contrast with the more mature Savenni\u00e8res, we will try a youthful dry Vouvray by Hu\u00ebt, one of the most admired winemakers of the appellation.<\/p> <p><i>Cour-Cheverny:<\/i>\u00a0 This is an interesting rarity from Touraine\u2014a small appellation producing white wines from the nearly extinct Romorantin grape, which produces wines with herbaceous, floral, and citrus notes.\u00a0 I\u2019m actually not sure I\u2019ve ever tried Romorantin before, so I\u2019m looking forward to tasting this mature example by Cazin, the most reputable maker in the appellation.<\/p> <p>Also included in the tasting are two wines from more general appellations\u2014Vin de Pays du Loire and C\u00f4teaux du Loir (not a typo\u2014the Loir is a tributary of the larger Loire).\u00a0 And these wines are made from grapes that are less noble than Chenin Blanc and Cabernet Franc, but they are distinct to the Loire region and can excel when carefully made.\u00a0 Grolleau is, frankly, the trash grape of the Loire Valley.\u00a0 Vigorous and productive, it is widely grown and made into indifferent ros\u00e9.\u00a0 But Clau de Nell makes it into a rich red with surprising concentration.\u00a0 I tried it at a trade wine tasting and found myself returning to it to try it again\u2014it was probably the most interesting and surprising wine I tasted all day.\u00a0 Pineau d\u2019Aunis is an ancient variety that is declining in the Loire Valley, but it can produce a red wine with interesting peppery spice.\u00a0 Bellivi\u00e8re\u2019s Rouge Gorge is probably the most prestigious bottling of Pineau d\u2019Aunis around.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Appropriately enough, we\u2019ll be trying these ultra-French, classic bistro wines at Saint George bistro in Hastings, where they will seat us in a private upstairs dining room.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/saintgeorgebistro.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/saintgeorgebistro.com\/\"

90<\/i> \u2013 From ripe and \u2013 by the taste of it \u2013 subtly-desiccated fruit, Cazin\u2019s subtly sweet yet persistently bright 2008 Cour-Cheverny Cuv\u00e9e Renaissance smells of pineapple, lemon, hedge flowers, almond extract; offers prickly citrus zest, pungent white pepper, piquant toasted nuts, and suggestions of crushed stone to complement its juicy palate appeal, and finishes with bittersweet, insistently tart persistence. There have been more profound exemplars of this cuv\u00e9e but seldom one so likely to find immediate and exemplary employment at table. That said, you can expect this to be well worth following for at least 8-10 years.<\/p> <p><b>2007 Damien Laureau Savenni\u00e8res le Bel Ouvrage\u00a0 $41 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Tanzer 93<\/i> \u2013 Bright gold. Wild, highly aromatic scents of singed orange, pear skin, magnolia, lemongrass, honey and vanilla bean. Broad, deeply concentrated citrus and orchard fruit flavors are braced by dusty minerality, with the exotic vanilla note joined by touches of mace and candied ginger. The floral element comes back on the finish, which is impressively pure, penetrating and persistent. Lots going on now but this will be even better with a few years of bottle age.<\/p> <p><b>2013 Domaine Hu\u00ebt Vouvray Sec Le Haut Lieu\u00a0 $27 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Spectator 92<\/i> \u2013 This is very expressive, with chutney, warmed apple, piecrust, orange blossom and honeysuckle notes all woven together and carrying through the quinine-fueled finish. Shows superb density and length for the vintage. Best from 2015 through 2022.<\/p> <p><b>2011 Hospices de Saumur Clos Cristal Saumur-Champigny\u00a0 $28\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Enthusiast 88<\/i> \u2013 The Hospices de Saumur is a charitable foundation, and Clos Cristal is a donated vineyard owned by the hospital. This young, fruity 2011 shows some rough, rustic edges while also giving full, red berry fruits and some tight tannins. For aging over the next 2\u20133 years when it will smooth out.<\/p> <p><i>From Grapes White Plains:<\/i> \u201cAn utterly remarkable Saumur-Champigny called\u00a0Clos Cristal. Now imported into the United States, it is unconditionally the finest Cabernet Franc from the Loire aside from the three Clos Rougeard wines it has been my joy to taste. . . . Made from 40-50 year old vines. Spicy aroma redolent of dark berries just getting to full ripeness. Rich entry, clean palate impression with the ripe fruit surrounded by superb Cab Franc acidity, Tannins are resolved. A fine example of Saumur red wine. Perfect with grilled meats.\u201d<\/p> <p><b>2009 Couly-Dutheil Chinon Clos de l\u2019\u00c9cho\u00a0 $33\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Guide Hachette des Vins 2012<\/i> \u2605\u2605\u2013 Fleuron du domaine, le Clos de l\u2019\u00c9cho rouge appartient jadis \u00e0 la famille de Rabelais.

An elegant ensemble supported by soft tannins.)<\/p> <p><b>2011 Anne-Claude Leflaive Clau de Nell Vin de Pays de Loire Grolleau\u00a0 $38\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Jancis Robinson 15\/20<\/i> \u2013 Very natural indeed! Hard work on the end. A real insider's wine. Pretty hard work. Should be served cool.<\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 87<\/i> \u2013 The inky colored 2011 Grolleau is from 60- to 90-year-old goblet vines on a silty-clay terroir, comprising grit and red flint on tufa (limestone). Aged for 12 months on fine lees in fifth-use Burgundy casks and another 12 months on fine lees in vats, the unfined and unfiltered wine shows an attractive, well-balanced bouquet of red and black forest fruits (including elderberries and sloes) intertwined with delicious floral and earthy\/fungous aromas. It is a fresh, straight, rather light to medium-bodied, meaty and slightly spicy wine with an accentuated acidity and an unpretentious expression of fruit. The ripe, meaty tannins are exclusively from the skins and give this attractive red a serious expression and a good structure. This wine should be served at 16\u00b0C.<\/p> <p><b>Domaine la Bellivi\u00e8re Le Rouge Gorge C\u00f4teaux du Loir Pineau d\u2019Aunis 2013\u00a0 $40\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Not rated.\u00a0 From Decanter: <\/i>\u201cPineau d\u2019Aunis, an underrated and underused Loire variety, is exciting and peppery.

Campos<\/p> <p>Kizomba (a word meaning \"Party\" in angola ) takes its origin from the Angolan dance Semba, which is also the origin of the Brazilian Samba.<br\/>It appeared at the end of 70\u2019s \u2013 80\u2019s, while the young Angolans, although very attached to their traditional dance,sought a new musical identity, and finally found their inspiration and new voice at a concert given by Kassav, a famous French Caribbean Zouk band. Kizomba was born out of this new generation\u2019s desire to bring a touch of sensuality and sweetness to their national Semba.<br\/>The influence of the Angolan Kizomba soon spread to all the African Lusophone countries such as Guinea Bisau, Cape Verde, Mozambique. From there the dance quickly found its ticket to Europe via Portugal, where it further developed, by all these Artists, teachers, choregraphers coming from\u00a0these Luso-African countries.<br\/>As it rapidly gained popularity, Portugal exported Kizomba to various countries in Europe such as France, Spain, Poland, Belgium, Danemark and England.\u00a0<br\/>Today it is rare to find a Latin dance party without Kizomba represented, as well as salsa or bachata.<br\/>This \"African Tango Zouk\", also called \"Tango Lusophone\" continues to conquer a growing audience of passionate dancers, eager for beauty of gesture and sensuality, but also the indispensable complexity of exchange and trust present in each motions of Kizomba.<br\/>This young dance of barely thirty years is booming today, and constantly evolving.<br\/>\"Kizomba is a tribute to sensuality, an ode to love and sharing. A moment when the woman's beauty, enhanced by her partner, must embody all its essence. \" D.

He seemed to be the representation of the life that I wanted and thought I needed.\u00a0 I was lost, out of control, out of my mind, with no direction or manual on how to stop this crazy machine that seem to take over me.\u00a0 I was obsessed and may be even possessed.\u00a0<\/p> <p>When he was around, I was happy. When he was not, I was miserable and lost. It seemed like all my turn-on and ability to be happy in life depended on him and his presence. \u00a0<\/p> <p>One day it all ended.\u00a0 I got divorces and lost my love affair in the same breath. With that, I started to rearranged my whole life.\u00a0 I promised never to fall in love again in the way that it was and in the way that it happened.\u00a0 There has to be more to love than a stale, sexless marriage of duty and devotion or an obsessive escapade that takes over me and ends in heartbreak and disappointment.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The truth was, I didn\u2019t know what I wanted.\u00a0 I started searching. This was a place where I began the path to waking up. I embarked on the journey of self-discovery and working with my consciousness to find the part of me who knew exactly what she wanted, what she needed and how to feel fulfilled. I learned about Orgasmic Meditation and my life has changed how I looked at relationships and at love all together.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Although I craved romance and love, the kind of love I received was not what I expected. Soon I learned that the type of love and attention I thought I needed was different from the love and attention I wanted.<\/p> <p>I will not lecture to you against love. This lecture is more about how love makes us who we are, and who we can become. In fact, I\u2019m here to tell you who we are and who we become depends on how we use love to keep growing and expanding our level of awareness into ourselves and relating to others.

(Joshua 7:10)\u00a0 Once revealed, we need to confess our sins to Him (and repent of them) and, if appropriate, to those whom we offended.<\/p> <p>2.\u00a0 We need to assume the sins of the nation on ourselves; just as Daniel did for the sins of the nation of Israel (Daniel 9).<\/p> <p>3.\u00a0 It is absolutely crucial that in all these endeavors that prayer be our primary focus.\u00a0 We need to rely on prayer (Jesus) as the foundation for everything that we do.\u00a0 In addition, prayer teams need to be set up that will pray before, during, and after all events, etc. in order to bath in prayer everything that we do.\u00a0 These prayer teams will be the \u201cheavy lifters\u201d who will be moving heaven and earth for us as we fight to regain our nation.<\/p> <p>4.\u00a0 We should follow (among other prayers in the Word), the prayers of repentance and requests for restoration that we find in the Bible, as we pray for our nation.<\/p> <p><b>Prayer Focus:<\/b><\/p> <p>1.\u00a0 Jesus is the only way and the only power that will enable our nation to turn around (2 Cor 7:14). We need to focus on Him and to trust in Him alone, as we confess and turn from our sins; that He will tear down the strongholds of the enemy in our nation and in our individual lives. \u201cWhen the enemy comes in; like a flood the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him.\u201d (Isa 59:19). We must not trust in any tactic, procedure, or whatever in order to overcome the devil (who is behind all of the evil that we see around us). \u201cFor our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.\u201d Ephesians 6:11-13<\/p> <p>2.\u00a0 We need to ensure that we stay focused.\u00a0 The enemy (Satan) will try different tactics against us, e.g., to get our focus off of that which is most important and to either divert our attention on that which is least important and\/or try to get us to do too much.\u00a0 He will probably try to bring division amongst us.\u00a0 My guess is that it would be through misunderstandings, hurt feelings, etc.\u00a0 We must be aware of this up-front, expecting the attacks and to realize that the attacks are coming from the enemy and not from what we can, e.g., see with our natural eyes.<\/p> <p><b>Prayer Tactics:<\/b><\/p> <p>1.\u00a0 We need to find appropriate Scriptures to stand upon to bring before the Lord as we pray individually and corporately.\u00a0 It is crucial that we not follow a hard fast cook book approach; even one that is based on the Bible.\u00a0 We need to know what the Scriptures say and then to allow the Holy Spirit to use what He\u2019s taught us to do or to pray those things that He brings to mind or puts into our hearts to do.\u00a0 For example, don\u2019t have the \u201cHail Mary\u201d prayer approach, e.g., I always have to pray this way or to pray these prayers in this exact order.<\/p> <p>2.\u00a0 The Church needs to be actively involved in politics and other social endeavors such as education, health care, the legal system, etc. (if even just knowing what is going on). In politics, the Body should then intelligently and with Christ-like love contact their representatives making their viewpoints known.\u00a0 These godly leaders need to then rally the Body perhaps at local auditoriums, stadiums, etc. in order show the Church the truth about how our nation began and how the Church was actively involved in all facets of social life for the first few hundred years of our pre- and post-national existence.\u00a0 The Body needs to learn that we must stand on what God\u2019s Word says and to fight for what\u2019s ours (just as the Israelites entered the Promised Land, fought huge giants, and won).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Finally, remember:<\/p> <p>2 Chron 16:9 \u201cFor the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him\u2026\u201d<\/p> <p><b>PREPARATION FOR PRAYER-STUDY MATERIALS<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Repentance from Idolatry<\/b><\/p> <p>All the sins described below are the symptoms of a bigger sickness, which is denying God as our creator and not glorifying him and acknowledging him as the supreme ruler of the universe. Rom 1:29 states \u201cAll Unrighteousness\u201d stems out from the root of idolatry (Rom1:23). So, fornication is not a sickness, it is one of the symptoms of idolatry, covetousness is not a sickness, it is another symptom of idolatry, etc.<\/p> <p>It is very important to focus our prayer efforts on this first cause of sin, which is ignoring God, suppressing the truth, and replacing the Creator by the created. God and truth are self-evident, but we choose to rebel against it. What we need is to repent from that.<\/p> <p>Studying the nature of repentance would help tremendously in our efforts to pray and intercede for people because repentance is the key to come back to God and be healed.<\/p> <p>Rom 1:18\u00a0 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;<\/p> <p>Rom 1:19\u00a0 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed <i>it<\/i> unto them.<\/p> <p>Rom 1:20\u00a0 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <i>even<\/i> his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:<\/p> <p>Rom 1:21\u00a0 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified <i>him<\/i> not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.<\/p> <p>Rom 1:22\u00a0 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,<\/p> <p>Rom 1:23\u00a0 And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.<\/p> <p>Rom 1:24\u00a0 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:<\/p> <p>Rom 1:25\u00a0 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.<\/p> <p>Rom 1:26\u00a0 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:<\/p> <p>Rom 1:27\u00a0 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.<\/p> <p>Rom 1:28\u00a0 And even as they did not like to retain God in <i>their<\/i> knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;<\/p> <p>Rom 1:29\u00a0 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,<\/p> <p>Rom 1:30\u00a0 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,<\/p> <p>Rom 1:31\u00a0 Without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:<\/p> <p>Rom 1:32\u00a0 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.<\/p> <p>Here\u2019s an example of what causes repentance:<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray that America focus on the much that we have, so our hearts is filled with thanksgiving for his goodness towards us, and our hearts lead us to repentance.<\/p> <p>Rom_2:4\u00a0 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray that the end result of America\u2019s tribulations, the recession, the aging and health deterioration of Americans, the financial distress, etc. work for our good, changing our hearts and drawing closer to God.<\/p> <p>2Co_7:10\u00a0 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray that America realize that God wants every American to be saved and not face judgment.

When it is used in connection with God, it is usually positive. God never repents to do good for his people. God repents himself from exercising judgment and punishment on his people.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray that God will change his mind executing the punishment that we deserve.<\/p> <p>Num_23:19\u00a0 God <i>is<\/i> not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do <i>it?<\/i> or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?<\/p> <p>1Sa_15:29\u00a0 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he <i>is<\/i> not a man, that he should repent.<\/p> <p>Psa_110:4\u00a0 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou <i>art<\/i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.<\/p> <p>Psa_135:14\u00a0 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.<\/p> <p>Jer_18:8\u00a0 If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.<\/p> <p>Satan is the God of this world. He endows his faithful servants with power to promote sin from the top down. In that sense, it is very important to know that sin is not based on grass root strategies; it is a highly organized well-funded push strategy.<\/p> <p>Blindness comes from Satan.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray in the Name of Jesus and bind Satan\u2019s power, rebuke his authority, and order him to take away his hands off America.

And the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness.\u201d<\/p> <p>3 When I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled. 4 Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice.<\/p> <p>5 Then, at the evening sacrifice, I rose from my self-abasement, with my tunic and cloak torn, and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the LORD my God 6 and prayed:<\/p> <p>\u201cI am too ashamed and disgraced, my God, to lift up my face to you, because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens. 7 From the days of our ancestors until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today\u2026<\/p> <p>10 \u201cBut now, our God, what can we say after this? For we have forsaken the commands 11 you gave through your servants the prophets when you said: \u2018The land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples. By their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other. 12 Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.\u2019<\/p> <p>13 \u201cWhat has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt, and yet, our God, you have punished us less than our sins deserved and have given us a remnant like this. 14 Shall we then break your commands again and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us, leaving us no remnant or survivor? 15 LORD, the God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence.\u201d<\/p> <p>5.\u00a0 Pray that the Lord will rise up godly pastors (or Church leaders) who will agree to work together to preach and teach on preparing the Church, e.g., to first of all pray and fast for our nation in small and large gatherings (at work during lunch hour, at home, in parks, at church, at social gatherings, etc.) around our nation; asking the Lord to have mercy on America (as we, as Christians confess our sins of idolatry, ambivalence, etc. to Him.\u00a0 Also, these leaders should teach of the need for the Church to be actively involved in the world (to be the salt and the light of the world).\u00a0 But, everything - absolutely everything should be focused on love; the Father\u2019s agape love being shown to the world.\u00a0 \u201cA new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.\u00a0 By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.\u201d (John 13:[masked])<\/p> <p>As an example of a godly leader raising the awareness of God\u2019s people to gather together in repentance, is Ezra:<\/p> <p><b>Excerpts from the Book of Ezra (Chapter 10):<\/b><\/p> <p>\u201cWhile Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites\u2014men, women and children\u2014gathered around him. They too wept bitterly. 2 Then Shekaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, \u201cWe have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel. 3 Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law. 4 Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage and do it.\u201d<\/p> <p>5 So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath. 6 Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.<\/p> <p>7 A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem. 8 Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.<\/p> <p>9 Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain. 10 Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, \u201cYou have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel\u2019s guilt. 11 Now honor[a] the LORD, the God of your ancestors, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives.\u201d<\/p> <p>12 The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: \u201cYou are right! We must do as you say. 13 But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing. 14 Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us.\u201d 15 Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this.<\/p> <p>16 So the exiles did as was proposed.

We have three extra rooms, 5 beds and an air mattress. We have two patios, large back yard, BBQ, and anything else you may need for your comfort! We will spend one or two nights at a resort on the coast or in the keys depending on the deals at the time. When: We will be traveling the Friday August 14th - Tuesday August 18th<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Who can come?:<\/b> Anybody who has attended one of the previous meetups or one of the meetups coming up. Also anybody who loves to get away, be in the sun, and just have a gosh darn good time! All ages welcome :D. We will be cooking too so bring your aprons! Of course you are welcome to do as you please but if you are not vegan it will be politely asked that you stick to vegan food on the trip :D.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Payment Timeline:<br\/>RSVP (Non refundable)<br\/>$250 deposit to secure your spot by Monday 4\/20 Tickets will be purchased Tues 4\/21<br\/>$200 Due May 15th<br\/>$150 Due June 1st (to finish paying Hotel and secure car rental)<br\/>$90 Due no later than August 1st<\/b><\/p> <p>Be sure to fill out this form:<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/1ci7oC4zO9m6oIKUL_a2hVWijAU76bt2TQeWzy-TUC9g\/viewform?usp=send_form\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/1ci7oC4zO9m6oIKUL_a2hVWijAU76bt2TQeWzy-TUC9g\/viewform?usp=send_form<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCVegansofColor\/events\/221523139\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":356400000,"name":"Miami Getaway in August! $690 All inclusive with Flights","id":"221523139","time":1439553600000,"updated":1439911929000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1403487965000,"name":"NYC Vegans of Color!","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":15251472,"urlname":"NYCVegansofColor","group_lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Vegans of Color"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"124 7th Avenue","name":"Le Pain Quotidien","lon":-73.998398,"id":23641673,"state":"NY","lat":40.740891,"repinned":false},"headcount":3,"distance":0.76949852705,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1435333321000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Weekly morning Lean Coffee in the Chelsea area.<\/p> <p>Day of week, timing, and location open to suggestions to change based on what people prefer.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you want to learn what a Lean Coffee is, click here:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nyc-kanban\/pages\/Running_a_Lean_Coffee\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nyc-kanban\/pages\/Running_a_Lean_Coffee\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nyc-kanban\/pages\/Running_a_Lean_Coffee\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nyc-kanban\/events\/224429204\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":3600000,"name":"Chelsea weekly Lean Coffee (morning)","id":"fkswhlytlbsb","time":1439555400000,"updated":1439561707000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1285003057000,"name":"NYC Lean\/Kanban","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":1709849,"urlname":"nyc-kanban","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Lean\/Kanban Practitioners"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11201","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"108 Jay Street","name":"DUMBO Kitchen","lon":-73.986862,"id":7174432,"state":"NY","lat":40.701664,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.35063624382,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1426682539000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>These informal breakfasts (inspired by the awesome and late <i>Dumbo Tech Breakfast<\/i> events) are a great way to meet people, discuss projects and ideas, and share experience.<\/p> <p>Grab a coffee \/ food (<i>each buys his own<\/i>), and have fun!<\/p> <p>Dan<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Find the group at a large table by the bar or ask the staff","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NY-Hub\/events\/224085603\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":9000000,"name":"The Hub - Friday Tech Breakfast","id":"fnsfglytlbsb","time":1439555400000,"updated":1439582383000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1424357064000,"name":"The Hub","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18446006,"urlname":"NY-Hub","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Spokes"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"disclosed on ticket","name":"private setting","lon":-73.826897,"id":23964115,"state":"NY","lat":40.8619,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.5357952118,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439318691000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/d3mjyf8rb023qs.cloudfront.net\/api\/file\/fMkMdFrtSTiEn6W8qykm\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/d3mjyf8rb023qs.cloudfront.net\/api\/file\/fMkMdFrtSTiEn6W8qykm<\/a><\/p> <p>Riding a bike through \u201cthe-city-that-never-sleeps\u201d is quiet an experience!

Now for the first time, nine decades of Hirschfeld\u2019s work will be on display at the New-York Historical Society in The Hirschfeld Century: The Art of Al Hirschfeld, a multimedia exhibition organized in partnership with The Al Hirschfeld Foundation and in conjunction with Alfred A.

The Temperance Movement, which had many women in its ranks, first urged the moderation of alcohol\u00a0 and then ultimately complete prohibition of alcohol. Later during Prohibition, the manufacture, transportation and sale of alcohol was illegal; however, there were many \"side effects\" of Prohibition, including the\u00a0many speakeasies (illegal drinking spots) that popped up. These speakeasies had unmarked doors that led to \"intoxication rooms\" with velvety interiors. Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, a NYC mayor in the 1930s and 1940s,\u00a0once said, \"It is impossible to tell whether Prohibition is a good or bad thing. It has never been enforced in this country.\"<\/p> <p>On this walking tour, we will look at some of the symbols of the Temperance Movement in the 19th Century as well as talk about Prohibition speakeasies and the rise and fall of Prohibition in the 1920s and early 1930s. We'll stop outside of four or five faux speakeasies. If we can, we will\u00a0go inside\u00a0two or three of these\u00a0faux speakeasies, including one site that was an actual speakeasy during Prohibition.<\/p> <p><b>This is a walking tour with much commentary.\u00a0We'll be walking about 2 1\/2\u00a0miles. There will be plenty of stopping at points of interest. If you don't like a lot of stopping, then this type of walk is not good for you. The tour lasts about 2 1\/4 hours.<\/b><\/p> <p>Below is an old photo of a slogan for the Temperance movement in the late 19th century.\u00a0This\u00a0photograph was taken in Thomas Edison's\u00a0movie studio at West Orange, NJ.\u00a0<i>(Source US\u00a0 Interior Dept., Nat'l Park Service, Thomas Edison Nat'l Historic Site)<\/i><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/f\/2\/600_439883794.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Below is\u00a0an article from <i>The New York Times<\/i>, August 26, 1887.

Offering an elegant and stylish atmosphere.\u00a0 We will have a special section reserved for our group for socializing then great live music from Barry Bryson and the Stan Rubin Quartet.\u00a0 The Carnegie Club is also one of the select few clubs in NYC that you can still enjoy legal tobacco in.\u00a0 What to expect:<\/p> <p><br\/><b>$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you wish to join you will need to prepay as spaces are limited.\u00a0 Please use this link: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/cigars-cocktails-live-jazz-tickets-18105759815\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/cigars-cocktails-live-jazz-tickets-18105759815\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/cigars-cocktails-live-jazz-tickets-18105759815<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>-About a dozen members and friends casually gathering for cocktails and conversation.<\/p> <p>-Some will smoke cigars, (other legal tobaccos okay too) .

Once done, click the gray 'next', then the blue 'review' button in the upper right corner. -This takes to a confirmation screen.

Chef Pous, who grew up and trained as a chef in Cuba, intertwines his heritage and experience with Jeffrey Chodorow's original vision.\u00a0 The new menu represents Chef Pous\u2019 interpretation of what Asian-influenced Cuban food would be today if Cubans had been able to innovate and evolve their cuisine over the past 50 years, when they did not have access to the range of global ingredients which had been available to the rest of the world.<\/p> <p>Renowned designer Rafael de Cardenas created the interior for Asia de Cuba. Evoking the hazy, seductive feeling of Havana's gloried nightlife past, the restaurant's interior is a contemporary reflection of Asia de Cuba's unique personality and legacy.<\/p> <p>MENU:<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/asiadecuba.com\/new_york\/3292\/adcnysummerrw_dinner2015\"><a href=\"http:\/\/asiadecuba.com\/new_york\/3292\/adcnysummerrw_dinner2015\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/asiadecuba.com\/new_york\/3292\/adcnysummerrw_dinner2015<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>FOOD GALLERY:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Wagyu Char Siu Beef Short Ribs<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/asiadecuba.com\/files\/c9d776d38ca6c72ca04a697816f6e026_full_size.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Palomillo Salmon<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/asiadecuba.com\/files\/05030ba22d4278cda934f0a118282e32_full_size.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Ropa Vieja of Duck<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/asiadecuba.com\/files\/8c532dc05222cc8c9f92fec8ae7bfbfa_full_size.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Tha Beef Salad<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/asiadecuba.com\/files\/c194c2bdabbc28223facc33c6116b67a_full_size.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>RESTAURANT GALLERY:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Main Dinning Area<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/asiadecuba.com\/files\/c220ab95ffbc9ec94c80933cdec666f5_full_size.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Bar<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/asiadecuba.com\/files\/f90376f6abe15c6ed42b4b40b70efcbb_full_size.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>RESTAURANT REVIEW:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/asia-de-cuba-london\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/asia-de-cuba-london\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/asia-de-cuba-london<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>DISCLAIMER:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>END<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/events\/224549459\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Resturant Week Late Dinner @ Asia De Cuba (Asian Fusion, Cuban)","id":"224549459","time":1439600400000,"updated":1439613848000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1421303761000,"name":"NYC Asian Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18338455,"urlname":"NYCAsianMeetup","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Asians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Astoria","address_1":"27-16 23rd Avenue","name":"QED","lon":-73.91507,"id":23218652,"state":"NY","lat":40.775856,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.31769657135,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438962379000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Co-hosts Pat Stango &amp; Clayton Gumbert &amp; Gregg Zehentner all have the same birthday (more or less) and want to celebrate with YOU at this month's <a href=\"http:\/\/qedastoria.com\/collections\/fortress-of-attitude\/products\/fortress-of-attitude-1\">Fortress of Attitude comedy spectacular<\/a>.

We have been to Hangar 3 each of last two years and it was certainly a blast! Also, it will be peak foliage season at the area.<\/p> <p>Hang gliding is an air sport in which a pilot flies a light and unmotorized foot-launchable aircraft called a hang glider (also known as Delta plane or Deltaplane). Most modern hang gliders are made of an aluminium alloy or composite-framed fabric wing. The pilot is ensconced in a harness suspended from the airframe, and exercises control by shifting body weight in opposition to a control frame, but other devices, including modern aircraft flight control systems, may be used. In the sport's early days, pilots were restricted to gliding down small hills on low-performance hang gliders. However, modern technology gives pilots the ability to soar for hours, gain thousands of feet of altitude in thermal updrafts, perform aerobatics, and glide cross-country for hundreds of miles. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale and national airspace governing organizations control some aspects of hang gliding.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hang_gliding\">Learn more here...<\/a><\/p> <p>The morning will start with a safety briefing and instruction, and you will be towed in a tandem hang glider to 2,500 ft above ground with an 'USPHA' rated tandem instructor at your side, then release to fly freely like a bird and land safely on wheels.<\/p> <p>They video each flight with an on\u00a0board\u00a0camera.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p>We'll play 3 simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with goals. There will be 6 teams on the field and we will play three games, 30 minutes\/game. Every 30 minutes we will have a short break and teams will switch to play against different team. Please check your email or our meetup message board on friday night or before 12.00pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p>If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.<\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>Riverside Park\u00a0at West\u00a0107 &amp; 108 Street<\/p> <p>Take the 1 RED Line Train to Cathedral Pkwy an walk two blocks down,\u00a0to 108th Street and Riverside Dr.<\/p> <p>The field is down the lower level near the river.

The fun begins at 11 AM and continues throughout the day.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Located in the shadow of the modern New York City skyline, Governors Island is the oldest European settlement in New York.

A short ferry ride from Lower Manhattan will get you there to picnic, photograph and enjoy gorgeous views. To get there, take the ferry from the Battery Maritime Building (located at 10 South Street, adjacent to the Staten Island Ferry in Lower Manhattan). You can get to the terminal via subway (#1 to South Ferry; #4 or 5 to Bowling Green; \u201cR\u201d to Whitehall Street) or by bus (M5 Limited, M15 local, M15 SBS, and M20 to their southern-most stops). \u00a0We'll meet up around 9:30 AM at the ferry building to catch the 10 AM ferry to Governors island. \u00a0This ferry as well as the 10:30, 11, 11:30 AM are free.

In the tradition of Spud Webb, anyone under 5'8\", male or female, is welcome to join us on the court.

Please arrive at least 5-10 minutes early as the sooner everyone arrives, the sooner we can begin playing. Note that all games stop at 7:45pm as we have to be out of the gym by 8:00pm. (If you get there late, please only ring the bell once. It is very loud! And it takes us a few minutes to get downstairs.) The gym is on the 10th fl. &amp; has adjoining bathrooms, lockers, and water fountains.<\/p> <p>We'll hit up McSwiggans (393 2nd Avenue @ 23rd St) later! Don't forget:<\/p> <p>* You must be no more than 5'8\" to play!<\/p> <p>* You must RSVP on the site in order to attend!<\/p> <p>* You will be asked to sign a waiver for 2014 as we're not a litigious group. If you have any problems with the prepay, just shoot one of the organizers an email.<\/p> <p>Here are the basic rules we follow for games: 1. Play by ones and twos to 11 - win by one point.<\/p> <p>2. Make it - take it.<\/p> <p>3. Backcourt if the ball hits the rim or backboard. Air balls are fair game to put right back up.<\/p> <p>4. Jump balls\/disputed calls will be determined by a three pointer since the laws of basketball physics are very clear that \"the ball never lies.\"<\/p> <p>5. Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds. 6. Subs will enter the game no later than 6 points in (once one of the teams reaches 6 points). The sub will start the following game. Teams will regulate themselves but let's make sure everyone plays.<\/p> <p>See you on the court! B-)<\/p> <p>***NOTE***<\/p> <p>In an effort for us to reduce overcrowding and to maintain a more accurate estimate of how many people to expect, please sign up online if you intend to play. There is a waiting list if all spots have been taken. We ask that you please just do not show up unannounced as you will kindly be asked to turned away. Also feel free to bring your own basketball for shoot-around. And don't forget to clip your nails prior to game day.

On the bayside of Island Beach State Park is an area called Tices Shoal, where boaters gather together and anchor.<\/p> <p><b>ITEMS TO BRING:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1_oB2LPvTB9SIxoLz2nzrm4JDyrRg1aYpD-vlu0AKH7k\/edit#gid=[masked]\"><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1_oB2LPvTB9SIxoLz2nzrm4JDyrRg1aYpD-vlu0AKH7k\/edit#gid=[masked]\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1_oB2LPvTB9SIxoLz2nzrm4JDyrRg1aYpD-vlu0AKH7k\/edit#gid=[masked]<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>ATTRACTION:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Clamming at Island Beach State Park<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.seagrant.noaa.gov\/Portals\/0\/EasyGalleryImages\/2\/93\/clam_kids.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Food &amp; Drinks<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1_oB2LPvTB9SIxoLz2nzrm4JDyrRg1aYpD-vlu0AKH7k\/edit#gid=[masked]\"><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1_oB2LPvTB9SIxoLz2nzrm4JDyrRg1aYpD-vlu0AKH7k\/edit#gid=[masked]\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1_oB2LPvTB9SIxoLz2nzrm4JDyrRg1aYpD-vlu0AKH7k\/edit#gid=[masked]<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Beach &amp; Water<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.nysparks.com\/parks\/images\/555b4dde-d5c5-4650-acff-f9fa282e1ce4.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Beach Volleyball<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.hdwallpaperscool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/volleyball-beach-hd-wallpapers-cool-desktop-widescreen-pictures1.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Extra Large Canopy<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/i.ebayimg.com\/t\/ABO-Gear-GO-ZEBO-Beach-Shelter-Canopy-Shade-Screen-Tent-\/00\/$(KGrHqMOKo4E1riCE30CBNt,ZfwV5g~~_3.JPG\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/i.ebayimg.com\/t\/ABO-Gear-GO-ZEBO-Beach-Shelter-Canopy-Shade-Screen-Tent-\/00\/$(KGrHqMOKo4E1riCE30CBNt,ZfwV5g~~_3.JPG<\/a><\/p> <p><b>CARPOOL: Suggested Cost, Driver decide.<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1_oB2LPvTB9SIxoLz2nzrm4JDyrRg1aYpD-vlu0AKH7k\/edit#gid=0\"><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1_oB2LPvTB9SIxoLz2nzrm4JDyrRg1aYpD-vlu0AKH7k\/edit#gid=0\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1_oB2LPvTB9SIxoLz2nzrm4JDyrRg1aYpD-vlu0AKH7k\/edit#gid=0<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>LTINERARY:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1_oB2LPvTB9SIxoLz2nzrm4JDyrRg1aYpD-vlu0AKH7k\/edit#gid=[masked]\"><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1_oB2LPvTB9SIxoLz2nzrm4JDyrRg1aYpD-vlu0AKH7k\/edit#gid=[masked]\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1_oB2LPvTB9SIxoLz2nzrm4JDyrRg1aYpD-vlu0AKH7k\/edit#gid=[masked]<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>WEATHER<\/b>:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wunderground.com\/q\/zmw:08006.1.99999?sp=KNJOCEAN18\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wunderground.com\/q\/zmw:08006.1.99999?sp=KNJOCEAN18\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.wunderground.com\/q\/zmw:08006.1.99999?sp=KNJOCEAN18<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>REFERENCE LINK:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.state.nj.us\/dep\/parksandforests\/parks\/island.html#scuba\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.state.nj.us\/dep\/parksandforests\/parks\/island.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.state.nj.us\/dep\/parksandforests\/parks\/island.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>DISCLAIMER:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>END<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/events\/224602728\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"Clamming and Beach Party @ Island Beach State Park","id":"224602728","time":1439647200000,"updated":1439773554000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1421303761000,"name":"NYC Asian Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18338455,"urlname":"NYCAsianMeetup","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Asians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":23.0377674103,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438521767000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>LEADER: Peter Reiner ([masked] or[masked])<\/b><\/p> <p><b>RATING: B\u00a05.5 C+<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Meet 10AM at Buttermilk Falls County Park on Greenbush Rd. in Orangetown for a car shuttle to the starting point, at Nike Overlook Park.

Thanks to the kind folks at The Trust For Governor's Island, we have been invited to fly over the island.

There will be a mandatory ceiling of 200 feet and no flight over the monument area of the island.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I will be posting further info in advance of this event.<\/p> <p>With all the negative press about our hobby\/profession\/passion, this is an opportunity for our group to demonstrate what safe, responsible UAS activity is all about.<\/p> <p>There will likely be press\/media there so bring your 'A' game! Also working to invite members of the NYC legislature in the hopes of influencing policy decisions.<\/p> <p>We are the ambassadors of UAS in NYC!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE DOCUMENT BEFORE THE EVENT AND ALL UPDATES<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>MORE INFO as of 08\/03\/2015<\/b><\/p> <p><i>thanks for everyone's excitement, suggestions, and questions. As you might imagine this is an important event. With the recent negative press around UAS and stupid people doing stupid things with drones around JFK, the leadership team is going through some flaming hoops to ensure that we have a safe and fun event.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>After consideration and discussion, we agree that this is not a flying event for beginners. Some of you have asked that very question, which we respect and are grateful for. If you feel that flying in potential high winds in a very restricted and monitored area is not what you are up to please don't make this event your proving ground.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>We do encourage beginners to come and learn from our more experienced members. Anyone that has been to our fly-ins knows how helpful and friendly we are. We are also in need of volunteers to act as safety officers and software checkers. A great opportunity to get involved.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>As stated before, we will be maintaining a 200ft ceiling with a radius of 250m. The monument area at the northern tip is a National Park and prohibited from being overflown. The island has several helicopter air routes running by the east, west and south and the Wall St heliport immediately due north. We request that no one fly beyond the land perimeter of the island out of respect to manned aviation.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>There will be a mandatory aircraft geo fence check on the Manhattan side prior to boarding the ferry. If your aircraft does not have the ability to create a ceiling and perimeter via GPS, it will not be permitted on the island. Operators must show safety officers their settings of 200ft ceiling and 250m perimeter in order to board with a drone.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p>By coincidence, National Model Aviation Day is August 15th - what better way to celebrate it!<\/p> <p>Here is a link with more information - donations go to The Wounded Warrior Project:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmodelaviationday.org\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmodelaviationday.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/nationalmodelaviationday.org\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><i><b>UPDATED INFO 8\/10\/2015<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>Some updates on how the event will unfold:<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Due to the high turnout expected we will be issuing lanyards and wristbands. Wristbands will be color coded and denote a particular takeoff and landing zone on a map that will be provided at check - in on the NYC side of the ferry.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Check-in will be done on a first-come, first-served basis. There are a limited number of flight slots per location. A wristband and lanyard indicate that your aircraft has been checked and you are assured of at least one flight on the island. Note that we have added an hour to the event's duration to accommodate more flying.<\/p> <p>Each flying site will be color coded and coordinate to the color of your wrist band. Time permitting you may be able to fly at another spot but only after everyone with the original color tag has flown. Your lanyard tag will be marked by safety officers to indicate you have had a turn in the air and at which station.<\/p> <p>Actual flying sites on the island will be determined after scouting takes place end of day tomorrow.<\/p> <p>We are currently instituting a \"Snooze, You Lose\" policy. <b>You must be checked in, have a wrist band and lanyard, and be on the 10:00a ferry in order to fly at this event.<\/b> This does not apply to spectators. We currently do not have the man power to have someone stay on the Manhattan side to check in late comers.<\/p> <p>This may change based on actual turnout but this is the policy at the moment. Please do not board the next ferry with your drone expecting to fly on the island. You will experience the wrath of those that arrived early!<\/p> <p>Please have your aircraft ready to be powered up (no props) and your smartphone app open to show your failsafe as \"return to home\", your altitude ceiling at 200ft or the metric equivalent, and a range of 250m. No exceptions.<\/p> <p><b>IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT 8\/12\/2015<\/b><\/p> <p>There are several factors affecting our time frame for the event:<\/p> <p>The first ferry to the island departs The Battery Terminal at 10:00a. By the time we reach the flying site on the island - a map will be posted here beforehand and printed for your reference - it will be near 10:30.<\/p> <p>There is an event going on in the \"Old Town\" section (<b>no overflight<\/b>)\u00a0- a Jazz Age music festival with people dressed in period 1920's costume. It doesn't begin until noon but its certain that some of the people going to that event will be boarding the 10:00 ferry.<\/p> <p>We currently have no mechanism in place for late arrivals. If you are not on the 10:00 ferry, please do not board with an aircraft thinking you can slip in. Wristbands and lanyards are what gets you to the flight line.<\/p> <p>With so many operators interested in flying, we must state once again that <b>this is not an event for beginners. <\/b>Not sure if you're a beginner? Can you fly figure 8's, land \"nose in\", know what \"nose in\" means? We just cannot stress this enough. This is a high profile public event and a lot of important 3 letter agencies are scrutinizing from near and far.<\/p> <p>We will be issuing lanyards to the<b> first 70 operators<\/b> that show our screeners (like the TSA but for god's sake leave your shoes on) your failsafe, RTH, flight ceiling and radius parameters on your control app or other interface.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>FAILSAFE - Return to home, Flight Ceiling 200 feet, flight distance radius 250 meters or equivalent.<\/b><\/p> <p>We will not have time to help you find the screens and make the settings - please do this in advance of your arrival at the Ferry Terminal. Have your app launched and your aircraft powered without props. Be patient and kind to all volunteers. We are here for your safety and the safety of others on the island. If you're not ready we may need to send you back in line until you are.<\/p> <p><b>Flight intervals have been reduced to 10 min<\/b> per turn in the air. We feel that for all the effort you are making to come to this event, it is better for everyone to get a chance to fly more but not all at once. Go get coffees for everyone, hydrate, put some sunscreen on and talk to your fellow enthusiasts. We have so much to learn from one another. Revel in the wonder of it all and then maybe fly again.<\/p> <p>There will be demarcated flight stations with traffic cones and a spectator line for everyone else to remain behind. Operators may have one person beside them for spotting or coaching but no one else may interfere with the operator while flying.<\/p> <p>Lastly, several of you are asking - <b>\"can I go higher than 200 feet?\" No.<\/b><\/p> <p>I scouted the island yesterday afternoon and the staff are very excited to have us do what we do best. Lets be exemplary in our behavior and observe the rules we have set.<\/p> <p>There is no overflight of the monument area where the ferry landing and old town and fort are. Maps will clearly demarcate what is out of bounds. There is and will be a tremendous amount of manned helicopter flight at altitudes that are quite low all around the island. Please do not fly past the boundary of land on the island - if you do, you will be asked to land immediately and will surrender your wristband and lanyard preventing you from any further flight activity.<\/p> <p>In addition you will be ridiculed by your peers and referred to as \"that guy\" or \"that girl\" for the remainder of the day and shamed publicly on the internet. Seriously, don't do it.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please be respectful of spectators and passersby do not fly behind the flight line.\u00a0<\/p> <p>There is likely to be press\/media there. Have smart things to say, and demonstrate good aeronautical decision making by keeping distance from other craft and not traversing the entire flight area - stay in your part of the sky.<\/p> <p>Lastly, be nice and be patient - our team of leaders and volunteers has put a lot of effort in to making this a kick-ass event for no other compensation than knowing they did their part to demonstrate their passion for UAS.\u00a0<\/p> <p>See you there!<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/f\/e\/600_440883838.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b><i>MAP LINK:\u00a0<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/jps3w9n5cfqxm89\/DUGnet%20Island%20Map%20for%2020150815_small%20%281%29.jpg?dl=0\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/jps3w9n5cfqxm89\/DUGnet%20Island%20Map%20for%2020150815_small%20%281%29.jpg?dl=0\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/jps3w9n5cfqxm89\/DUGnet%20Island%20Map%20for%2020150815_small%20%281%29.jpg?dl=0<\/a><\/a><\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>This map indicates the path of travel to take if you want to rent a bike to get around, all roads lead to us once you get past the food truck area.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Flight stations will be set up by color code.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for. Thank you, Lynn\" Bodhi Meditation Class Saturday March 14, 2015<\/p> <p>\n\n\"I have tried many different forms of meditation and yoga over the years. Though I have experienced some positive changes practicing over the years I never felt committed to practice on regular basis. Nan takes it to a whole other level. How and why? All I can say is you have to experience it for yourself. There is power in simplicity,love, and truth. Despite some language barriers(which are minor) You can feel her love and healing energy. Open your mind and see with a different set of eyes. I highly recommend her special Saturday classes.\" Michelina, Bodhi Meditation class Saturday November 15, 2014<\/p> <p>\u201c\u00a0My first time today. Nan is very helpful and dedicated. I enjoyed it immensely and I did experience a shift in energy. I feel more alert, relaxed and focused even as I write this testimony. I plan on attending her next class in Freeport.\" Michelina, Bodhi Meditation class September 17, 2014<\/p> <p>\u201c Very strong healing energy tonight. I got there feeling very tired. I had stomach pain all day, and during the first meditation of the evening it got a lot better. By the end I wasn't thinking about it at all. I left full of energy. \u201d Pam, Bodhi Meditation class November 22, 2013<\/p> <p>\u201c\u00a0I didn't realize I would be reaping the benefits of Bodhi Med so quickly after attending only two classes. After my second class I felt even more relaxed. I have insomnia, but after the second session I fell asleep faster and deeper which has not happened for a long time.\u00a0\u201d Dee, Bodhi Meditation class September 18, 2013<\/p> <p>\"I have been attending these classes for three weeks. They are amazing. Nan is wonderful! My energy level is shifting and I am beginning to experience an ongoing sense of well-being with balance and relaxation. Highly recommend!\" Kathleen, Bodhi Meditation class October 25, 2013<\/p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nBetween May 14,2013 and October 2014 over 2,500 people attended our classes in NYC and Long Island.<\/p> <p>The Saturday class is for a small group.

It channels universal energy rather than working with what\u2019s within one person. It transcends the genetic and physical limits of just one being by relying and drawing energy from the entire universe.<\/p> <p>2). The entire human body is the receiver of this energy. The energy\u2019s effects on the body do not rely on certain meridian paths or pressure points of the body, which are the common requirements for many types of the Qi Gong practices.<\/p> <p>Students will experience two forms of Bodhi Meditation.<\/p> <p>* Seated<\/p> <p>* Movement<\/p> <p>Your class instructor is Nan Ni Gilbert. Nan is a NYS licensed acupuncturist and Chinese herbalist. Nan is also one of the most advanced Bodhi Meditation energy healer in North America.<\/p> <p>Feel free to ask Nan your personal health questions after the class.<\/p> <p>Please arrive early for class intro\/setup.<\/p> <p>Class basic info:<\/p> <p>* Loose fitting clothes is recommended but not required.<\/p> <p>* Some people bring their own yoga mat for the seated meditation part. This is not a requirement as we have chairs for everyone.<\/p> <p>* Cellphones needed to be turned off during the class.<\/p> <p>Here is the internet link if you are interested in purchasing the meditation music used in the class.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\">&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\"&gt;<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\">&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\"&gt;<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\">&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\"&gt;<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\">&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\"&gt;<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\">&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\"&gt;<\/a>\u00a0----------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>\n\n\nI leave you with Master JinBodhi's Golden Words:<\/p> <p>(Editor's note: The following phrases were suggested by Master JinBodhi and subsequently introduced to his students as a daily practice.

In this school, we focus in \u2018whole-body strength emission\u2019. In the area of self-defense, this is of major importance, since one wants to hit an attacker as hard and as fast as possible, and incapacitate him\/her within three seconds, in order to save our lives; while maintaining internal equanimity and control. However, most people respond to life-threatening attacks with only the strength of their arms or legs, as opposed to the strength of their whole bodies. Therefore, our responses to attacks are significantly hampered, and our chances of survival get drastically minimized.<\/p> <p>Erle Montaigue\u2019s Fajing Quan System of Fighting and Healing is the system of training created by Erle Montaigue, the founder of the World Taiji Boxing Association, in order to develop true whole-body fajing, the method of movement through which we engage every joint in our body in perfect coordination in an explosive manner, delivering full-body strikes into our opponent (think about how much you weigh, as opposed to only the weight of your arm or your leg).\u00a0<\/p> <p>This desired response is achieved by accessing our reptilian brain, which has been sophisticated through one\u2019s training, and operate from it in the event of an attack, as opposed to operate from our cerebral cortex\/human brain, which processes information slower by trying to understand logically what is happening. Our reptilian brain acts only on reflexes, which are deeply engrained in our nervous system; so our training will come out just as another learnt reflex, like muscle memory.<\/p> <p>This ability to fajing will be useful also in the healing arts, by emitting healing energy through the same method, in a soft, non-explosive way (Yin-Yang uses of a core, unique principle).<\/p> <p>The training consist on:<\/p> <p>- 8 Wudang Stepping Methods<\/p> <p>- 12 Wudang Hand Weapons Drills<\/p> <p>- Small San Sau Self-Defense Form<\/p> <p>- One Hand Yang Style Martial Push Hands<\/p> <p>- Entering Methods<\/p> <p>- Internal and External Mechanics for Striking\/Kicking\/Punching<\/p> <p>- Wudang Knife Forms<\/p> <p>- Introduction to Dim Mak<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Contact info: 646-820-8653","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/WTBANYC\/events\/223889595\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"WTBA's Fajing Quan - Erle Montaigue's System of Fighting and Healing","id":"dfxrhlytlbtb","time":1439654400000,"updated":1439669526000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1401724195000,"name":"World Taiji Boxing Association - New York City","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":14829442,"urlname":"WTBANYC","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"disclosed on ticket","name":"private setting","lon":-73.826897,"id":23908699,"state":"NY","lat":40.8619,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.5357952118,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439406908000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/d3mjyf8rb023qs.cloudfront.net\/api\/file\/BkbyzypbSeCHqvOVlEYE\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/d3mjyf8rb023qs.cloudfront.net\/api\/file\/BkbyzypbSeCHqvOVlEYE<\/a><\/p> <p>Who ever said down home Southern food can't be made vegan has not been to this cooking class.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a
