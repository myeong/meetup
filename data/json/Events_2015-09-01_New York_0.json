Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Play by ones and twos to 11 - win by one point.<\/p> <p>2. Make it - take it.<\/p> <p>3. Backcourt if the ball hits the rim or backboard. Air balls are fair game to put right back up.<\/p> <p>4. Jump balls\/disputed calls will be determined by a three pointer since the laws of basketball physics are very clear that \"the ball never lies.\"<\/p> <p>5. Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds. 6. Subs will enter the game no later than 6 points in (once one of the teams reaches 6 points). The sub will start the following game. Teams will regulate themselves but let's make sure everyone plays.<\/p> <p>See you on the court! B-)<\/p> <p>***NOTE***<\/p> <p>In an effort for us to reduce overcrowding and to maintain a more accurate estimate of how many people to expect, please sign up online if you intend to play. There is a waiting list if all spots have been taken. We ask that you please just do not show up unannounced as you will kindly be asked to turned away. Also feel free to bring your own basketball for shoot-around. And don't forget to clip your nails prior to game day. We tried playing with Edward Scissorhands once - it didn't turn out so well.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Basketball-for-the-vertically-challenged\/events\/222915256\/","yes_rsvp_count":22,"duration":9900000,"name":"Summer mornings pickup games","id":"xqkkhlytlbcb","time":1438437600000,"updated":1438448838000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1284011099000,"name":"[New York Co-Ed]  Basketball for the Vertically Challenged","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1703973,"urlname":"Basketball-for-the-vertically-challenged","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"bball shorties"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10018","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"99 W 40th Street","name":"Bryant Park Ice Skating (Citi Pond)","lon":-73.985016,"id":4397722,"state":"NY","lat":40.753563,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.359186768532,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1353940035000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We have group members ice skate at Bryant park every Tuesday\/Thursday morning from 8 AM.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Though I have experienced some positive changes practicing over the years I never felt committed to practice on regular basis. Nan takes it to a whole other level. How and why? All I can say is you have to experience it for yourself. There is power in simplicity,love, and truth. Despite some language barriers(which are minor) You can feel her love and healing energy.

I highly recommend her special Saturday classes.\" Michelina, Bodhi Meditation class Saturday November 15, 2014<\/p> <p>\u201c\u00a0My first time today. Nan is very helpful and dedicated.

It retells the story of the 1959 murders of the Clutter family in Kansas by a pair of drifting misfits, Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, and of the subsequent trial and execution of the murders. Capote also uses the polarities of this particular case as the starting point for a larger examination of the values of the late 1950s and early 1960s America; the respectable Clutters are so wholesomely all-American that they could almost have been invented, while Smith and Hickock come over as brutal real life versions of the James Dean \"rebel\" culture.<\/p> <p>The world of the victims is painstakingly and sympathetically reconstructed, but Capote's real interest is in the emotional lives of Perry and Dick, and what might have led them into such murderous excess. Indeed, some argue that Capote was so fascinated by Perry Smith because he saw in him a possible alternative version of himself.<\/p> <p>Given that Capote wrote about the crime throughout the trial, it has even been suggested that the final verdicts were conditioned by the way in which his journalism had portrayed the killers. In this light, <i>In Cold Blood <\/i>offers a larger, more disturbing insight.

A few miles later 22 squeezes down to 2 lanes, as you go through some of the prettiest and wealthiest residential areas of Northern Westchester County. We will also stop to eat at some point probably Pats Deli will see what we decide. Must be able to maintain highway speed and please come with a full tank of gas any question feel free to call me at[masked] Lew<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/4\/5\/6\/600_440257974.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-INTERBORO-RIDERS\/events\/224299699\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Kensico Dam\/Route 22 Bedford NY","id":"224299699","time":1438441200000,"updated":1438488662000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1430485177000,"name":"NYC INTERBORO RIDERS","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":18571833,"urlname":"NYC-INTERBORO-RIDERS","group_lat":40.5999984741,"who":"NYC INTERBORO RIDERS"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"Disclosed once ticket is booked","name":"Private","lon":-73.826897,"id":23961653,"state":"NY","lat":40.8619,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.5357952118,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437500808000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>You'll be making arranging your own glass container succulent garden, AND learn the basics of succulent care, different layering techniques, and propagation tips!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Container, potting materials and succulents are provided.

We'll see abandoned fortresses and bunkers, and bask in the tranquility of this otherworldly environment, a renowned refuge for shore birds and free spirits. We'll stop on the beach for a leisurely rest, snack, or swim. Time and energy permitting, we'll visit the new Brooklyn Bazaar at the recently renovated bathhouses. We'll return by taking a bus from either Riis (near the boat landing) or the far side of the Gil Hodges bridge; the bus will take us to the 2,3 train at Brooklyn College. But you can return by boat for an extra charge (see below).<\/p> <p><br\/>SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: <b>Don't be late,<\/b> or you may not secure a spot on the boat.\u00a0<b>Bring lunch,<\/b> which will start at around <b>12:45<\/b> PM, <b>plus a snack<\/b> for later in the day if you wish.\u00a0<b>Buy a boat ticket before getting on line no later than 11 AM<\/b>.

That will allow you to wear shorts or a bathing suit if you wish.\u00a0<\/p> <p>DISTANCE: About 3.5 to 4 miles if you catch the bus at Riis, 5 miles if you catch it across the bridge.<\/p> <p>ENDING TIME: We should reach the subway between 5 and 6 PM, depending on whether take the bus at Riis or across the bridge.

In this school, we focus in \u2018whole-body strength emission\u2019. In the area of self-defense, this is of major importance, since one wants to hit an attacker as hard and as fast as possible, and incapacitate him\/her within three seconds, in order to save our lives; while maintaining internal equanimity and control. However, most people respond to life-threatening attacks with only the strength of their arms or legs, as opposed to the strength of their whole bodies. Therefore, our responses to attacks are significantly hampered, and our chances of survival get drastically minimized.<\/p> <p>Erle Montaigue\u2019s Fajing Quan System of Fighting and Healing is the system of training created by Erle Montaigue, the founder of the World Taiji Boxing Association, in order to develop true whole-body fajing, the method of movement through which we engage every joint in our body in perfect coordination in an explosive manner, delivering full-body strikes into our opponent (think about how much you weigh, as opposed to only the weight of your arm or your leg).\u00a0<\/p> <p>This desired response is achieved by accessing our reptilian brain, which has been sophisticated through one\u2019s training, and operate from it in the event of an attack, as opposed to operate from our cerebral cortex\/human brain, which processes information slower by trying to understand logically what is happening. Our reptilian brain acts only on reflexes, which are deeply engrained in our nervous system; so our training will come out just as another learnt reflex, like muscle memory.<\/p> <p>This ability to fajing will be useful also in the healing arts, by emitting healing energy through the same method, in a soft, non-explosive way (Yin-Yang uses of a core, unique principle).<\/p> <p>The training consist on:<\/p> <p>- 8 Wudang Stepping Methods<\/p> <p>- 12 Wudang Hand Weapons Drills<\/p> <p>- Small San Sau Self-Defense Form<\/p> <p>- One Hand Yang Style Martial Push Hands<\/p> <p>- Entering Methods<\/p> <p>- Internal and External Mechanics for Striking\/Kicking\/Punching<\/p> <p>- Wudang Knife Forms<\/p> <p>- Introduction to Dim Mak<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Contact info: 646-820-8653","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/WTBANYC\/events\/223889613\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"WTBA's Fajing Quan - Erle Montaigue's System of Fighting and Healing","id":"dfxrhlytlbcb","time":1438444800000,"updated":1438454343000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1401724195000,"name":"World Taiji Boxing Association - New York City","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":14829442,"urlname":"WTBANYC","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"disclosed on ticket","name":"private setting","lon":-73.826897,"id":23937696,"state":"NY","lat":40.8619,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.5357952118,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438206349000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Learn to draw in just two hours!

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

These challenges come in many forms and what is a challenge for one is not an issue for another. So everyone is unique and comes with their own set of experiences. But there are universal issues that we all face.\u00a0 The principal ones are money, love, weight, health, and career. We are raised to believe that the way to face these challenges is through hard work and a little knowledge. But nothing could be further from the truth. This is because success is not a set formula that anyone can follow. Everyone must take their own path to getting what they want and there is no one-size-fits-all template to success.<\/p> <p>Yet one thing is clear. Many go their entire lives working hard, waiting for their ships to come in yet with no or limited success. \u00a0Even worse, some seem to be magnets for money and success in life without putting in a hard day\u2019s work. \u00a0But why? Is the universe unfair? On the contrary, there is rhyme and reason to the madness. First off, you must understand that to overcome challenges in your life you have to get right to the source. Unfortunately, our society is caught up in verbal trickery. What I mean by that is that many come along with PHDs at the end of their names and try to address your issues through a verbal discourse in the hope that through deductive reasoning you will come to an understanding of what is the root cause of your plight. Millions of dollars are spent on this type of discredited Freudian treatment.<\/p> <p>But how many have been told to stop smoking, stop over-eating, stop taking drugs, stop dating that selfish person, yet they continue to do so knowing full well that what awaits them is likely to be pain and suffering. This is because verbal communication cannot change behavior no matter how passionate you are. How many preachers and ministers whose faith seems unbreakable are caught with their pants down in some type of indiscretion?<\/p> <p>Let us examine slavery for example. Many of the chief architects of this horrible atrocity were Christians, Muslims and Catholics. But if they were holy men and women how could they have endorsed the capture and enslavement of an entire continent of people? This is because their religions relied on sermons and verbal language through scriptures as a means to try and spiritually uplift people. This simply does not work. Our ancient ancestors knew this simple truth. This is why most indigenous cultures practiced meditation and trance induction as a means to communicate directly with the subconscious mind, which is the seat of your power.\u00a0 Now many are turning to hypnotherapy to control their weight, stop smoking or drug-taking, and to relieve pain from surgery or relationships. \u00a0These therapists and patients have finally realized that the power to effect change lies not in the conscious mind but rather the subconscious mind. We must realize that the conscious mind can only execute what the subconscious mind directs it to.\u00a0 The effectiveness of this type of treatment has been proven in many scientific papers and studies. Yet still to this day many are unaware of the success rate of techniques such as hypnotherapy and trance induction. This is because those in control, the global elite, have imprisoned our minds in left brain externalized thinking.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/6\/0\/600_439796928.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>HYPNOTHERAPY MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE<\/p> <p><br\/>Although it\u2019s on the cutting edge of mind therapy, hypnotherapists have made a critical error. They have treated the subconscious mind like a computer. Their psychology being what you put in is what you get out. This is untrue and demonstrates a true gap in their understanding of men and women. It was our ancient so-called primitive ancestors who referred to the subconscious mind as \u201cthe spirit\u201d or \u201cthe indwelling intelligence\u201d.\u00a0 They knew early on that the subconscious was consciousness and was intelligent. Hence it is omnipresent and omniscient.\u00a0 This indwelling intelligence doesn\u2019t just serve to direct the conscious mind based on commands you program into it, this intelligence is responsible for everything that happens to you in the physical world. It creates the very reality you see before you.<\/p> <p>This means it plays an active role in your life and is not just relegated to dreams, nightmares and subconscious thoughts and traumas. It is what some in the new age movement call your higher mind. It is all-knowing and connected to everything we experience. \u00a0If fact, there really is only one consciousness that we all share.\u00a0 But we erroneously believe there is a division within consciousness. There is only division within our physical bodies, which separate us on this planet.<\/p> <p>Treating the indwelling intelligence within you like a dumb computer that can only be programmed to accomplish the task it is given is to severely limit the power it can accomplish for you. Yes, it\u2019s true you must either program it or command it to perform a task but because it is a super-intelligence it is one thousand steps ahead of your perception. In fact, when you are born it is already aware of your destiny and aligns circumstance to allow you to fulfill the objective of your new incarnation. If you do not program it, it will proceed on its own and lay the foundations for either your success or failure.\u00a0 But in reality there is no failure, only experience, so what appears to you as a futile attempt is a great experience for the intelligence within. Remember, its goal is to experience reality based on the destiny you have agreed to prior to coming to this physical plane of existence.\u00a0 So as it sees it there are no good or bad experiences, only information to help it grow in understanding. But this is a discussion for another time; for now we want to focus on empowering you.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/f\/d\/a\/600_439797306.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>YOUR SUFFERING IS A NEEDLESS ACT<\/p> <p><br\/>We are taught that suffering is a natural part of life. In essence, no pain no gain. That we have to go through emotional ups and downs, pain and pleasure.\u00a0 In most cases when adversities befall those who have tried to live a righteous life we are told that God will right the wrong done in his own time. Yet, we are never told the entire truth; that pain and pleasure are emotional states that can be triggered at will.\u00a0 We simply, as a society, are ignorant of the fact that we, not some outside entity, have the ability to remove any physical or emotional pain troubling us. And also, that if needed we can summon such pleasure that it surpasses that of any drug.\u00a0 These are techniques that can be learned by anyone!<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s look at the implications here so we can see a real picture of how society has screwed up our thinking and belief system:<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A young man becomes addicted to drugs. His addiction causes him to lose his job, friends and the love of family members. He takes to stealing to support his habit. The urge for cocaine is so strong that he simply cannot resist it. In our society he is labeled a drug addict and ostracized. If he is lucky and not arrested for carrying the drugs he may go into a good and expensive treatment center, where they will talk him through a 12 step program.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A young woman suffers from poor grades in school. She tries just as hard as everyone else but can\u2019t seem to keep up. Many of the subjects she studies are very intense such as biomechanics requiring many hours of study and research. She fails her final term paper and is forced to repeat the class. If she decides to seek help they will assign her a study buddy who will spend countless hours with her in the library coaching her through the dense material.\u00a0 Her career is on the line and she must somehow pass this class while not neglecting her other classes.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A young man is motivated to start his own business. So he pays thousands of dollars to attend motivational seminars, business lectures and purchases all kinds of at-home programs on how to get rich. Yet, hard as he tries each business is a dismal failure.\u00a0 He becomes more and more disenchanted. He watches TV or the internet and sees the success others are having and comes to the conclusion that he is just a failure in life. \u00a0Once more he dreams of meeting big investors who will fund his business. But he knows he has no such contacts in his Rolodex. He gets a regular 9 to 5 and calls it a life.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A man is physically abusive to his wife and daughter. He seeks help to manage his temper and the psychologist traces it back to when he was a child. They discover that he was physically abused by his father and neglected by his mother. In fact, as a child he was sent to the hospital a number of times for broken bones and open wounds inflicted by the violence. The psychologist uses talk therapy to help him realize the origin and resolution to his difficulties. But the man still has occasions or bouts of anger so he takes it one day at a time.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A violin player finds herself spending countless hours and thousands of dollars on training. She enjoys the music and the instrument. Through the tried and true practice of repetition she practices the same songs and notes over and over again until she has blisters on her fingers. She even forks over her life savings to hire one of the best violin coaches in the country. She dreams of being in the London Symphony Orchestra or perhaps being solo as a world-renowned player. But she knows full well that it may take years for her to get to master the instrument. And worse, she may discover that she just doesn\u2019t have the talent for it and will have to make a decision to move on with her life. She fears being a housewife or working for corporate America. But the truth is the odds are not in her favor given the current paradigm of society and its failure on how to teach people to awaken their inborn talents.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 An aspiring actress looking for her big break attends casting call after casting call but doesn\u2019t land that big role. She pays for acting classes and attends seminars on how to make it in Hollywood. She even moves to California and gets a job as a waitress so that she can have flexible hours and attend her auditions.\u00a0 But the years pass and yet still no roles. Even worse with each audition she attends she is told she is not the right type. She is too old, too fat, too skinny, too short, too tall, too blonde, too ethnic looking, etc. All of this rejection takes a toll on her mindset. Where she was once a positive individual with hopes of movie fame she now realizes that success in acting eludes her. She gives up and gets a regular job, family and settles down to a normal life.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 An attractive woman is plagued by relationship issues. She dates different guys looking for her soul mate but there seems to be no chemistry with these men.\u00a0 Even worse, the guys are jerks, self centered and egotistical. She desires someone to compliment her and daydreams of the perfect mate and children. She realizes that her clock is ticking but there seems to be little that she can do. The club and bar scene is unrewarding as it only results in guys looking for one night stands. So too is the internet. She tries dating sites but the guys hype up their profile and are just looking for one thing. She has even prayed to God to help find her a good man but to no avail. She ends up becoming bitter and disenchanted. Finally, she adopts the belief that love is a myth.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A martial artist puts in hundred of hours of practice. She loves to spar and often travels the country competing in competitions. But she has reached a plateau and can\u2019t seem to advance to the next level.\u00a0 So she increases her efforts but can\u2019t seem to perfect her kicks or her form. She looks around at other martial artists who perform their fights with ease, never forgetting one step. She notes that they are bigger and stronger than her and wonders if she\u2019ll ever be at their skill level. She knows in her heart she has the fire of a lioness but something is holding her back.\u00a0 Her 5th degree instructor just yells at her telling her to push, push, push! But the more she pushes herself the fewer results she sees. So she resigns herself to the fact that she just doesn\u2019t have the natural ability that other martial artists possess.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A young woman finds herself in a terrible position. Everything she eats no matter how little increases her weight. She looks in the mirror and realizes she is severely overweight. However, she can\u2019t stop eating. So in an attempt to handle the situation she tries several fad diets. At first she loses some weight, which makes her feel good. However, in almost no time she regains the weight again and her self-image and self-confidence plummet. Even worse she realizes that when she goes out with her girlfriends guys no longer approach her. She tries diet pills but they don\u2019t work either. Finally, she takes out a gym membership but finds it hard to make the time to go to the gym after work. She knows that being overweight is a health risk but she feels there is nothing she can do. She wants to accept the notion that big is beautiful and accept her full-figured self. However, she often spends Friday and Saturday night at home in deep depression.<\/p> <p>As you can clearly see all of the case studies above have two things in common: the reliance on verbal communication to get a person to change his or her behavior, and the dependence on physical means to address their problems. If one were to examine the statistics we would see that such treatments are a dismal failure. But then one may ask why is it that some people have effectively quit smoking, shed weight or stopped drinking? Is this not proof that verbal talk does work?\u00a0 No, this is because the emotion and desire to change in those individuals penetrated the conscious mind and tapped directly into the subconscious mind effecting true change thus manifesting their desires.\u00a0 But not everyone has the knowledge to be able to do this nor are people aware enough to be able to reproduce the formula or effects. In religious circles this change is often mislabeled as being born again or God saved me. In secular circles it is attributed to a person\u2019s own drive to change all the while never realizing that the change came after they bypassed the conscious mind to communicate and commanded the subconscious mind to make the radical transformation.\u00a0 What folks failed to realize is that the power was always within them and the reliance on outside entities such as pills, gurus and books only served to make things more difficult.<\/p> <p>Now what I am advocating here is by no means a quick fix. But it is a lot easier than spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars trying to overcome a bad habit, emotional issue or learn something new. What we teach is so powerfully effective that you will notice the results overnight. We\u2019re talking about giving you not only the ability to overcome what is currently challenging you but to empower you with the ability to succeed in any aspect of your life.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/9\/6\/600_439796982.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>YOU\u2019LL HAVE THE POWER<\/p> <p><br\/>And do not forget that the net result of your efforts is not just the impregnation of information but the ability to tap into an awesome power that can align the forces of physical reality at your command. This is God\u2019s true blessing and the reason why you don\u2019t have to continually beg him for the things you need in life. He has given you the power to get them and more. Imagine if you will having the power to reshape the world to give you the things you need.

You will feel more relaxed and peaceful as Divine energy is channeled to everyone simultaneously.<\/p> <p><i>What is Reiki energy healing?<\/i><\/p> <p>Reiki is a simple way of channeling high vibration energy for healing purposes for ourselves or others. It clears blockages in our energy channels so that our physical body can be healthier. The practitioner does not use his\/her energy, but is just a channel through which the energy flows. Reiki Tummo goes beyond traditional Reiki in that it is not just a healing modality, but also helps us to grow spiritually by opening our spiritual heart which is our connection to the Creator. Reiki Tummo also uses kundalini and earth energy for a deeper and gentler acceleration of cleansing and spiritual growth.<\/p> <p><i>What else do I need to know?<\/i><\/p> <p>Donations are gratefully accepted, but if you can't donate please feel free to come.

Every musical and dramatic work takes its audience on a journey, generally consisting of the following elements:<\/p> <p>1-) Introduction and elaboration: The central melodic theme is introduced and often repeated, in identical fashion or with variation. The mood of the piece is presented and established via use of dynamics, tempo and melodic arc.<\/p> <p><i>The performer must<\/i> draw in the audience at this point, either with a compelling narrative subtext, or strong emotional message. Also, the performer must build gradual tension (when applicable), leading the audience to the musical <i>climax<\/i>.<\/p> <p>2-) Climax: The highest emotional point of the work, usually occurring 2\/3 to \u00be into the piece. Requires maximum expression and melodic emphasis to evoke a desired reaction or response from the audience. Also considered a reward point, or tension release for the audience.<\/p> <p><i>The performer should<\/i> fully understand the climactic point of the piece, and clearly highlight this point via the use of tone, dynamic expression and musical touch. The importance of the climax for audience understanding and satisfaction cannot be underestimated.<\/p> <p>3-) Resolution: The conclusion of the piece, during which all unresolved musical elements are resolved in a decisive manner.<\/p> <p><i>The performer must<\/i> prepare the audience for the eventual end of the musical journey, a return to reality. Musical cues which aid this transition include:<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 gradual decrescendo and diminuendo<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 a clear a decisive \u00a0end point , so as to not leave the audience with an uneasy feeling of something unresolved<\/p> <p>Entertain your audience: Great entertainers (actors, singers, etc.) put their unique personality into every performance. If you want to make a memorable impression upon your audience, introduce a new, unique perspective on your piece. Once you truly own your piece, it should carry the inimitable stamp of your personality, but also <i>sound as if it is being performed for the first time<\/i>.<\/p> <p>Select pieces that are personally meaningful to you, and allow for your maximum expression as both performer and entertainer.<\/p> <p>Performances do not have to be memorized, or note-perfect. However, as a courtesy to your audience, please present a work that you have studied attentively, and can play to its completion.<\/p> <p>If you make a mistake during your performance, <i>please continue to play without stopping<\/i>. Apologizing, repeating a previously played section, or stopping will only call more attention to your mistake.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"website: www.nycclassical.com, email: acma@nycclassical.com","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/classical-139\/events\/224061390\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"duration":7200000,"name":"Rescheduled: ACMA July 2015 Concert","id":"224061390","time":1438459200000,"updated":1438467653000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1202513261000,"name":"Amateur Classical Musicians Association","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1001619,"urlname":"classical-139","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Classical Music Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10028","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"1000 5th Ave","name":"Met Museum - Ruth and Harold D Uris Center For Education, 81st Street Plaza Entrance","lon":-73.962929,"id":15718592,"state":"NY","lat":40.779167,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.46817660332,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1379180734000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's explore the Met together every other Saturday with as little pressure as possible.<\/p> <p>Go in the 81st entrance (not up the big stairs), and head straight back to the Uris Center for Education.

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

Cafe \u201cAt Your Mother-in-Law,\u201d is a Korean-Uzbek restaurant in Brighton Beach, right off the boardwalk.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Directions: (From Port Authority)\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Take D train downtown to 18th AVE.\/20th Ave\/ Bay Pkwy<\/p> <p><b>MENU:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.menupages.com\/restaurants\/cafe-at-your-mother-in-law\/menu\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.menupages.com\/restaurants\/cafe-at-your-mother-in-law\/menu\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.menupages.com\/restaurants\/cafe-at-your-mother-in-law\/menu<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>FOOD GALLERY:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Kuksu: At first glance this looks like a routine Chinese lo mein soup, only skewed toward Korean tastes, but a second reveals that the roster of ingredients makes this more like a floating form of bibimbap.

Empire Steakhouse has done very successful in the last few years serving the best of steaks in a beautiful dining room setting. This is the second restaurant Empire has open up due to the success they had ( the one we are using is the 54th St location) If you have never gone to a steahouse with our group I just want to aware you of the following. We used only upscale venues with eye struck surroundings. Many of the steakhouse we used our listed in the top 10 in the city by many lists. In the past we have used Benjamin, Staler, Capital, Ben &amp; Jack's, Delmonico, Strip House and just recently Angus on Valentine's Day. An average steak here is about $48. For those who want a non steak meal , the average entree is $35. All steak venues are well prepared that there are many non meat eaters and served some of the best seafood dishes in the city. Each couple is responsible for the cost of their own meal.

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p>We'll play 3 simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with goals. There will be 6 teams on the field and we will play three games, 30 minutes\/game. Every 30 minutes we will have a short break and teams will switch to play against different team. Please check your email or our meetup message board on friday night or before 12.00pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p>If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.<\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>Riverside Park\u00a0at West\u00a0107 &amp; 108 Street<\/p> <p>Take the 1 RED Line Train to Cathedral Pkwy an walk two blocks down,\u00a0to 108th Street and Riverside Dr.<\/p> <p>The field is down the lower level near the river.

This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend.

If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p>Introduce yourself.

Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance.

Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

It will reveal who we are and what our purpose really is, the true history of both our Earth and of mankind, the structure of the Master Universe and our exact location in it, the various levels and functions of beings in many other realms.

Nelly (Nina Hoss), a German-Jewish nightclub singer, has survived a concentration camp, but with her face disfigured by a bullet wound. After undergoing reconstructive surgery, Nelly emerges with a new face, one similar but different enough that her former husband, Johnny (Ronald Zehrfeld), doesn\u2019t recognize her. Rather than reveal herself, Nelly walks into a dangerous game of duplicity and disguise as she tries to figure out if the man she loves may have been the one who betrayed her to the Nazis. Evoking the shadows and haunted mood of post-war Berlin, Phoenix weaves a complex tale of a nation\u2019s tragedy and a woman\u2019s search for answers as it builds towards an unforgettable, heart-stopping climax.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Cast:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/celebrity\/nina-hoss\/1961761\/main\">Nina Hoss\u00a0<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/celebrity\/ronald-zehrfeld\/435259\/main\">Ronald Zehrfeld\u00a0<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/celebrity\/nina-kunzendorf\/2111082\/main\">Nina Kunzendorf\u00a0<\/a>,<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/celebrity\/michael-maertens\/20028952\/main\">Michael Maertens\u00a0<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/celebrity\/imogen-kogge\/2005766\/main\">Imogen Kogge\u00a0<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/celebrity\/felix-romer\/20314259\/main\">Felix R\u00f6mer\u00a0<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/celebrity\/uwe-preuss\/20266633\/main\">Uwe Preuss\u00a0<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/celebrity\/valerie-koch\/2097454\/main\">Valerie Koch<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Director:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/celebrity\/christian-petzold\/1953616\/main\">Christian Petzold<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Genres:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/movie-genre\/historical-drama\">Historical drama<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Distributor:\u00a0IFC Films<\/b><\/p> <p><b>REVIEWS<\/b><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/publication\/rogerebertcom?filter=movies\">RogerEbert.com<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/critic\/brian-tallerico?filter=movies\">Brian Tallerico<\/a>Jul 24,[masked]A film this satisfying on every level \u2014 one that can be enjoyed purely for its narrative while also providing material for hours of discussion on its themes \u2014 is truly rare.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/critic\/brian-tallerico?filter=movies\">All this critic's reviews<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rogerebert.com\/reviews\/phoenix-2015\">Read full review<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/publication\/new-york-post?filter=movies\">New York Post<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/critic\/farran-smith-nehme?filter=movies\">Farran Smith Nehme<\/a>Jul 23,[masked]More than a thriller, Phoenix is a ghost story, made plain in an extraordinary shot of Nelly\u2019s terror at a passing train.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/critic\/farran-smith-nehme?filter=movies\">All this critic's reviews<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/nypost.com\/2015\/07\/23\/haunting-phoenix-expertly-blends-mourning-and-melodrama\/\">Read full review<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/publication\/the-av-club?filter=movies\">The A.V.

To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p><b>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/224205307\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Morningside Park","id":"gjrzflytlbdb","time":1438531200000,"updated":1438544298000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":8,"distance":10.5748910904,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437497729000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 <b>Hillclimb<\/b> - looking east (west below)<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/d\/4\/b\/600_440036651.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Park on roadside(below) - enter at orange cone(above)<\/p> <p>...and we'll be just past the black rock half way up the hill<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/a\/a\/b\/600_440035979.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Nj-Dug\/events\/224124938\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":14400000,"name":"Fly-In 'for the adventurous'","id":"zqfkjlytlbdb","time":1438531200000,"updated":1438712843000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1271057338000,"name":"NJ Drone User Group","group_lon":-74.1299972534,"id":1629197,"urlname":"Nj-Dug","group_lat":40.8600006104,"who":"Flyers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10018","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"128 West 37th Street","name":"The Church of the Holy Innocents","lon":-73.988274,"id":17189572,"state":"NY","lat":40.752235,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":100,"headcount":0,"distance":0.179055556655,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1386697886000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Holy-Innocents-Young-Adult-Group\/events\/223703178\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Young Adult Mass and Coffee hour.","id":"qknzghytlbdb","time":1438533000000,"updated":1438546544000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1385941960000,"name":"Holy Innocents Young Adult Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":11304132,"urlname":"Holy-Innocents-Young-Adult-Group","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Catholics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10595","country":"us","city":"Valhalla","phone":"914-337-3190","address_1":"Bronx River Pkwy","name":"Kensico Dam Plaza","lon":-73.77368,"id":3997042,"state":"NY","lat":41.06502,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":24.572271347,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1433352454000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>One of the summer's cultural heritage festivals at the Kensico Dam.<br\/>Music, dance, foods and vendors saluting the rich culture of India!<\/p> <p>We can meet at The Rising (9\/11 memorial on the east end of the plaza) and then go get food together.

This can not be any more true for his most philosophical work of all, Notes from Underground. Notes is Dostoevsky's groundbreaking philosophical prologue to his later novels, and it wrestles with <b>modern existential questions<\/b> which deal with Man's role in a world where the idea of God was being rejected more and more.<br\/>The Enlightenment of the 17th and 18th centuries espoused the value of reason, proclaimed the potential improvement of Man and Society, and freed humanity from superstition. By the 19th century, with the belief in God declining, Dostoevsky saw mankind having lost its moral bearing, wafting directionless in the tempest that is life. Instead of liberating Man for the better, the Enlightenment had renounced his spiritual connection. Where Dostoevsky saw a creature of God, his contemporary philosophers were seeking a new definition of modern man, out from under the definition of God.<br\/>Notes provides a greater perspective in European thought. The 19th century was characterized by a brutal polarization of <b>existential thinking<\/b> in which there was no synthesis. Dostoevsky and Friedrich Nietzsche epitomize this philosophical schism: at one end, Dostoevsky calls for Man to embrace faith and Christian morality; at the other stands Nietzsche, rejecting religion as unnatural and entreating Man to transgress contemporary moral values. By the turn of the century, Man and God were still as much a mystery as before, and so remain.<br\/>In Notes, Dostoevsky shows us the Underground Man, a despicable and pitiable creature who betrays himself and is not even aware of it. He is the creation of a thoroughly anti-modern author imploring his fellow Russians to resign from the West.<\/i><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/4\/600_440342932.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/2\/d\/f\/600_438261215.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I plan to arrive earlier to procure a few tables and chairs for the group.

Every setting \u00a0change I make will be explained to help you all understand the results of each change.

As a result, his works become much more than stimulating, entertaining stories but actual representation of 19th century intellectual history. This can not be any more true for his most philosophical work of all, Notes from Underground. Notes is Dostoevsky's groundbreaking philosophical prologue to his later novels, and it wrestles with <b>modern existential questions<\/b> which deal with Man's role in a world where the idea of God was being rejected more and more.<br\/>The Enlightenment of the 17th and 18th centuries espoused the value of reason, proclaimed the potential improvement of Man and Society, and freed humanity from superstition. By the 19th century, with the belief in God declining, Dostoevsky saw mankind having lost its moral bearing, wafting directionless in the tempest that is life. Instead of liberating Man for the better, the Enlightenment had renounced his spiritual connection. Where Dostoevsky saw a creature of God, his contemporary philosophers were seeking a new definition of modern man, out from under the definition of God.<br\/>Notes provides a greater perspective in European thought. The 19th century was characterized by a brutal polarization of <b>existential thinking<\/b> in which there was no synthesis. Dostoevsky and Friedrich Nietzsche epitomize this philosophical schism: at one end, Dostoevsky calls for Man to embrace faith and Christian morality; at the other stands Nietzsche, rejecting religion as unnatural and entreating Man to transgress contemporary moral values. By the turn of the century, Man and God were still as much a mystery as before, and so remain.<br\/>In Notes, Dostoevsky shows us the Underground Man, a despicable and pitiable creature who betrays himself and is not even aware of it. He is the creation of a thoroughly anti-modern author imploring his fellow Russians to resign from the West.<\/i><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/e\/600_440342942.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/2\/d\/f\/600_438261215.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I plan to arrive earlier to procure a few tables and chairs for the group.

Mark will be speaking via Skype to a PowerPoint presentation produced for this occasion. Questions are encouraged.<\/p> <p><b>Bio:\u00a0<\/b>Mark Kimmel has spoken at international forums, been a guest on radio and television shows, and has conducted workshops based on his unique insights into the transformation of Earth and her humans. Mark's books first three books, \u201c<i>Trillion<\/i>,\u201d \u201c<i>Decimal<\/i>,\u201d &amp; \u201c<i>One<\/i>,\u201d depict the activities benevolent ETs among us along with negative aspects of our 3rd\u00a0Dimension paradigm.\u00a0\u201c<i>Transformation<\/i>,\u201d\u00a0contain messages from Andromedans and celestials. His new book, \u201c<i>Chrysalis<\/i>,\u201d is being\u00a0written in conjunction with the Archangels and is contains information new to this planet. By focusing on both extraterrestrials and Archangels in his writing and speaking, Mark weaves a most credible picture of cosmic reality while presenting an uplifting vision for the future of mankind and of our planet. Mark avoids the \u201cevil aliens\u201d orientation of many who deal with ETs, while presenting insights about Archangels without a religious orientation. Mark moved to his current passion from a successful business career where he had worked for major corporations, then founded and ran three of the most respected Colorado venture capital funds. In addition to providing capital, Mark served on portfolio companies\u2019 boards and helped them with strategy and tactics. He retired from business in 1996 to pursue his quest into the larger aspects of our existence. Mark has been listed in Who\u2019s Who since 1985. He has degrees in engineering, marketing, finance, psychology, and divinity. Mark is married with two grown sons and four grandchildren. He spends his days writing and speaking about this, the pivotal juncture in human history, and how each person has the power to assist this metamorphic transformation for all on this planet and in this universe. He is the founder of the\u00a0<b>Cosmic Paradigm Network<\/b>, an international group dedicated to manifesting such a transformation.

He will also address who we really are as both physical and non-physical beings, and why we are here. Much of this information is new to this planet. Mark will be speaking via Skype to a PowerPoint presentation produced for this occasion. Questions are encouraged.<\/p> <p><b>Bio: <\/b>Mark Kimmel has spoken at international forums, been a guest on radio and television shows, and has conducted workshops based on his unique insights into the transformation of Earth and her humans. Mark's books first three books, \u201c<i>Trillion<\/i>,\u201d \u201c<i>Decimal<\/i>,\u201d &amp; \u201c<i>One<\/i>,\u201d depict the activities benevolent ETs among us along with negative aspects of our 3rd Dimension paradigm. \u201c<i>Transformation<\/i>,\u201d contain messages from Andromedans and celestials. His new book, \u201c<i>Chrysalis<\/i>,\u201d is being written in conjunction with the Archangels and is contains information new to this planet. By focusing on both extraterrestrials and Archangels in his writing and speaking, Mark weaves a most credible picture of cosmic reality while presenting an uplifting vision for the future of mankind and of our planet. Mark avoids the \u201cevil aliens\u201d orientation of many who deal with ETs, while presenting insights about Archangels without a religious orientation. Mark moved to his current passion from a successful business career where he had worked for major corporations, then founded and ran three of the most respected Colorado venture capital funds. In addition to providing capital, Mark served on portfolio companies\u2019 boards and helped them with strategy and tactics. He retired from business in 1996 to pursue his quest into the larger aspects of our existence. Mark has been listed in Who\u2019s Who since 1985. He has degrees in engineering, marketing, finance, psychology, and divinity. Mark is married with two grown sons and four grandchildren. He spends his days writing and speaking about this, the pivotal juncture in human history, and how each person has the power to assist this metamorphic transformation for all on this planet and in this universe. He is the founder of the <b>Cosmic Paradigm Network<\/b>, an international group dedicated to manifesting such a transformation.

The talent that joins our writing group always impresses me.<\/p> <p>Last session we also bid farewell to a good friend and blossoming novelist, Ashley, who is DC-bound.

Later, Nietzsche further developed the theory of existentialism by introducing the idea of free will and personal responsibility. In the early 1900s, philosophers such as Martin Heidegger and Jean-Paul Sartre began to explore the role of investigation and interpretation in the healing process. Over the next several decades, other contemporaries started to acknowledge the importance of experiencing in relation to understanding as a method to achieving psychological wellness and balance.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/5\/5\/600_438521813.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/5\/8\/600_438055640.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/7\/2\/600_438055666.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I will arrive early and attempt to procure tables, just east of the Carousel.

Some come from family or friends; others come from the news, movies, school, or other cultural institutions. Whether or not we intend them to, the stories we've encountered can shape our belief systems, feelings, and behaviors. This meetup is intended to create a space for critical examination of some 'American' stories- referring to the stories that most individuals living in the United States have been influenced by in one way or another. At earlier points in history, it would be more difficult to find such commonly encountered stories; however, with current levels of uniformity among the most prominent cultural institutions in the U.S. (media, K-12 education, entertainment, etc.), and widespread convenient access to such sources, we have a unique opportunity to spotlight some widespread, common influences.<\/p> <p>A <b>theme<\/b> will be chosen in advance for each of the meetings. Themes will highlight particular aspects of our daily existence by addressing various circumstances\/experiences (success, embarrassment, wealth, imprisonment, enlightenment, boredom, etc.), personal characteristics (kind\/ruthless, honest\/deceitful, ambitious\/lazy, respectable\/pitiful, etc.), and roles (friend\/foe, parent\/child, boss\/employee, partner\/spouse, teacher\/student, woman\/man, etc.), encountered in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>PLEASE BRING A \"STORY\":<\/b><\/p> <p>I ask that attendees bring a \"story\" <b>related to the theme<\/b> of that particular month's meeting. This \"story\" can consist of an image, a phrase or saying, a recurrent movie plot or advertising angle, some common advice or explanation... anything that you think might be <b>commonly encountered in U.S. culture<\/b>. At the beginning of each meeting, the stories brought by participants will be introduced (approx 1 minute each), and we will vote to determine which story (or stories) to investigate during that particular meeting. The following questions will guide our investigation thereafter:<\/p> <p><i>1) What are the obvious and less-obvious messages\/morals being communicated through the common story?<\/i><\/p> <p><i>2) What feelings and actions might we expect from a person who has internalized the messages\/morals being communicated through the common story?<\/i><\/p> <p><i>3) What realities (from our personal experiences) would contradict the messages\/morals being communicated through the common story?<\/i><\/p> <p><i>4) What feelings and actions might we expect from a person who has internalized the messages\/morals of the contradicting realities?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br\/><\/i><\/p> <p><i>5) What are some implications for society as a whole?<\/i><\/p> <p>\n\n\nI look forward to an invigorating and liberating exchange. ;)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Conversations-New-York\/events\/224303017\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"'AMERICAN'\u00ad STORIES: Uncovering Myths and Discovering Realities","id":"224303017","time":1438543800000,"updated":1438633925000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1353680064000,"name":"\"Conversations New York\"","group_lon":-74,"id":5963662,"urlname":"Conversations-New-York","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Conversationalists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11102","country":"us","city":"Astoria","address_1":"3601 35th Avenue","name":"Museum of Moving Image","lon":-73.923714,"id":1514425,"state":"NY","lat":40.756023,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.50146222115,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1435820595000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>There's a 3 day tribute to Mani Ratnam happening in Queens!

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.
