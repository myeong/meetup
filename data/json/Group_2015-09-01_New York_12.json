We are also recruiting candidates to be ordained as Celebrationist advocates throughout the world. You can find more information about these opportunities here:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ucm.center\/#!join-our-leadership\/c1yxv\">http:\/\/www.ucm.center\/#!join-our-leadership\/c1yxv<\/a><\/p>\n<br>\n<p><b>More information about the World Celebrationist Society and Celebrationism:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Who We Are<\/p>\n<p>For some, the World Celebrationist Society and the philosophy it is born from, Celebrationism, are movements of humanist ideology.&nbsp; For others we are an organization that provide a service in celebrating and advocating on behalf of the human race. Even still, for others, we are a project of intercommunal relationship and movements of spiritual discovery.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our purpose, quite plainly, is to create a more vibrant, tolerant, and understanding world.<\/p>\n<p>We strive to meet this goal by championing ideas of goodness.&nbsp;The World Celebrationist Society is the home of all people regardless of who they are, where they're from or what is in their history.<\/p>\n<p>We strive to serve as the unapologetic champions and advocates of all persons. We embrace members without exclusion in the spirit of compassion, forgiveness and the promotion of growth and progress. We celebrate in tribute to our bountiful existence and each element which contributes to it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We believe that the ideas that we teach are organic within us, but are not always easily fulfilled. Working through education, service, advocacy, celebration, support and exploration to fulfill and promote these good notions is our mission.<\/p>\n<p>Some choose to find the strength to meet these purposes with the aid of spirituality, others don't. Our organizations welcomes both groups of people. We do this simply because the operations that bring us further into goodness are inconsequential, for it is the goodness that is most imperative to sustaining the health of the world and offering comfort to its people.<\/p>\n<p>Every member of Celebrationism and its governmental body of service, the World Celebrationist Society, are encouraged to celebrate in their own individual way, in their respective forward journey of growth. In this idea comes great diversity in how each element of our mission and teachings are interpreted, and in many ways, that is quite precisely what we're all about. This visionary project is a tribute to that very spirit of complex diversity in humanity and the layered nature of individuality, with a respect for the common bonds that bring us together, in recognition of all the boundless potential, wonder and goodness that is &nbsp;inherent to our existence.<\/p>\n<p>We help realize these ideas through a special observation of the promotion of growth, positive gesture, philosophical action, celebration and active appreciation for the abundant wonders of our existence, both in the slightest nuance and the most blatant display of greatness - be it in nature, human achievement, art, sport, experience, gesture or anything else.<\/p>\n<p>We celebrate in silent, private appreciation and in open festivals of dedication and honor. We teach the importance of inclusive acceptance, forgiveness and personal growth, and we do it all in the spirit of celebrating the life we have the privilege of learning from, pleasuring in and in journey to a more richly happy life for all those burdened and blessed by this very experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For more information, please visit us at www.ucm.center<\/p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/2\/3\/highres_435866147.jpeg","photo_id":435866147,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/2\/3\/600_435866147.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/2\/3\/thumb_435866147.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":175339562,"name":"Michael"},"members":27,"name":"The United Celebrationist Movement - New York","id":18519228,"state":"NY","urlname":"The-United-Celebrationist-Movement-New-York","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Celebrationists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1427264208000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"anime","name":"Anime","id":286},{"urlkey":"scifi","name":"Sci-Fi\/Fantasy","id":317},{"urlkey":"cosplay","name":"Cosplay","id":640},{"urlkey":"comics","name":"Comic Books","id":794},{"urlkey":"manga","name":"Manga","id":2849},{"urlkey":"videogame","name":"Video Games","id":4471},{"urlkey":"cardgame","name":"Card Games","id":9792},{"urlkey":"geek","name":"Geek Culture","id":10493},{"urlkey":"birthday-parties","name":"Birthday Parties","id":15375},{"urlkey":"board-games","name":"Board Games","id":19585},{"urlkey":"japanese-anime-cosplay","name":"Anime Cosplay","id":30363},{"urlkey":"japanese-culture","name":"Japanese Culture","id":30366},{"urlkey":"geeks-nerds","name":"Geeks & Nerds","id":32623},{"urlkey":"anime-conventions","name":"Anime Conventions","id":52002},{"urlkey":"anime-and-cosplay","name":"Anime and Cosplay","id":65769}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC\/","rating":4.75,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/f\/0\/7\/600_439588423.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>Anime fans &amp; Super Smash Bros (Wii U) fans unite!

Is your Fiance is on her way over to New york in the next couple of months? You both can join this group and take advice or ask questions in our discussion group.  But the idea is for the couple to eventually join the meetups in person.\n\nThe THIRD purpose of this group is for other K-1 Filipino females in NYC to make new friends with each other (since most are away from their families\/culture\/friends for long periods of time and their husbands\/fiances are usually at work).  Filipino women in America need to stick together. \n\nThe FOURTH purpose of this group is for single American men who are looking to meet\/date Filipino women in Philippines for possible marriage and using the same K-1 visa fiance process to bring her over here.  Local singles interested can join this group for separate meetups nights.  If a K-1 visa filipina member don't have any single friends in Philippines (for a possible hook up), the single American must be open to Filipino dating websites. You'll need to bring your laptop to meetups to get advice or assistance with screening potential dating mates.  We have good advice for weeding out scammers and women looking for money only. \n\nIf you are interested or know someone interested, please join.  See you soon. \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nI'm Erica, the group organizer.  I'm from Philipines and I live in NYC with my American fiance.  I also went through the long K-1 visa journey process. \n\nI'm Vlane, Co-organizer Erica's American fiance. There is a growing demand for American's to date outside the country and outside their race.  The divorce rate is too high with American men with American women.   It's sad that so many men are married 2-4 times before they figure out there is a pattern.  A loyal filipino female will stay with you forever and treat you how you are suppose to be treated.  Every American citizen has a right to marry a female from another country and bring her over here. \nThere is a growing demand for these types of relationships.  Single American's get on board for the next generation of dating and marriages. \n\nSee you soon.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":182503568,"name":"Erica Marcelo"},"members":21,"name":"Filipino K-1 Visa couples & Americans for marriage.

We can order delicious drinks and snacks from the holistic Recologie caf\u00e9. We need at least 6 writers per meeting to keep the space, and we are asked to spend $10 each for food and drink. At each meeting, we will write to a prompt as well as read, critique and support at least two writers in our group who would like to share their writing. If you don't want to share what you write, that is also fine. On the Second Tuesday each month, a group reads their writing before a group on a mic. This will mesh well with our own group.

This will also help for us to get to know each other better and for some friendships to form:D<\/p>\n<p>The events will include: crafting\/DIY sessions (duh) at my apartment (yours too if you like\/outdoors when it gets warmer:),) going to museums\/galleries, Second Saturdays, going to creative\/inspiring\/art talks, Drink and Draws, drawing\/taking pictures in beautiful settings (i.e. Central Park, the Cloisters,) as well as non-art related happenings, such as: happy hours, going to tasty restaurants, picnics, hiking, concerts, and any other interesting NYC related things.<\/p>\n<p>I am open to any ideas!! (The more interesting and random, the better!)---and just want this to be a fun Meetup where people can get together to make things, talk creative, and\/or inspire one another with awesome ideas.<\/p>\n<p>I don't know about all of you, but after this winter I am ready to get inspired and be creative!

Are you also ready to have fun and make friends who are as serious about language learning as you are?&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p>If so, my name is Monroe Mann, and WELCOME TO THE FLUENCY PROJECT. <br> <br>MY DEFINITION OF NATIVE-LEVEL FLUENCY: <br>--can understand 99% of what is said on TV, in movies, and on the radio <br>--can understand 99% of modern slang <br>--can effectively and clearly communicate orally and in writing, with 99% grammatical and linguistic accuracy, not including technical conversations <br>--can read modern fiction, history books, newspapers, and magazines with a 99% word and sentence comprehension rate, without use of a dictionary<\/p>\n<p><span>I'm a linguist myself, and speak Mandarin Chinese, French, Italian, German, and others (at various levels of proficiency). While teaching English and studying Chinese in Shanghai, China for a year in 2014 and 2015, I realized a very important thing about language learning: THE ONLY WAY TO BECOME FLUENT IS TO DO THE REALLY HARD THINGS THAT YOUR MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHERS FORCED YOU TO DO WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>For example: <br>* read books; <br>* write essays; <br>* do grammar and vocab exercises <br>* have in-depth conversations with a focus on grammatical accuracy <br>* give presentations; <br>* watch movies; <br>* listen to the radio; <br>* listen to native speakers seminars;&nbsp; <br>And (this is the key)... ALL IN THE TARGET LANGUAGE.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>No schools I know do this. I have never been to a language program that required me to read a novel and write a five-page essay about it. I have never been to a language program that brought in native speakers to give presentations on unique topics. &nbsp;I have never been to a language program that provided ample opportunity to practice speaking with classmates on topics that will bring me closer to fluency. &nbsp;This list goes on. <br> <br>In other words, no other language program or group really forces you to do the things that will make you fluent. So I created it myself. &nbsp;Here. &nbsp;:) <br> <br>One of my goals in life is to speak at least ten languages, and at least five fluently. I created this group to help us all reach our fluency goals. All in a fun, social, environment WHERE ENGLISH IS RARELY USED. While this group introduction is in English, and the meetup descriptions on the site are in English, each group's activities (aside from oral instructions) are exclusively in the target language. Note: the Mandarin Meetup uses Hanzi almost exclusively so if you speak but don't read\/write, be prepared!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Bottom line: If you are serious about taking your foreign language skills from 'pretty good' to 'ABSOLUTELY AWESOME', come join us. :) &nbsp;Each meeting will be well organized, well thought out, efficient, and effective. &nbsp;You will leave each of our meetups with tangible improvement. &nbsp;Some of our meetups focus on speaking; some on listening; some on reading; some on writing. &nbsp;They all will challenge you to be better than you were when you first arrived. <br> <br>CURRENT LANGUAGES: Mandarin Chinese, French, Italian, German <br>COMING SOON: Spanish, Russian, Portuguese, Japanese, and more! &nbsp; <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p>NOTE: Please do NOT attend our events if you are a total beginner or can't have at the very least a basic conversation.&nbsp; VERY LITTLE ENGLISH WILL BE SPOKEN AT EVENTS. &nbsp;This is not a language school as much as it is a fluency school. &nbsp;Bring your intermediate\/advanced skills and let us together help you reach total fluency! &nbsp;I will bring all materials to each Meetup! <br> <br>If this all sounds interesting...

Hearings, requests for interviews from state and federal departments, testimony from individuals related to a news worthy event. If you know of a news worthy event YOU want to attend\/document, please let me know and with in reason I will post it, if you don't show up to your own suggested news event, you lose the right to suggest items. Please note, news worthy events will not necessarily be local to Somerset county! I find there are too many state and federal agencies that want the public to just go away and not ask questions. News media is not about entering a subject with a story to tell. It is about taking the chaos of a subject you might not be familiar with and making a story out of it. It is the foundation of film making, but it is not, it is reporting what you find and making a coherent story of it. Local news papers have been cut to the bare bone, and rarely do investigative reporting. This is an opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULES OF REPORTING FOR MEETUP: <br>RULE #1: You are not a participant, you are a reporter of the news, you do not place your self in danger, you do not place others in danger, you do not personally comment on situations or editorialize, you cover others at the event talking. They are the subject, not any of us in the meetup.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #2: If you want to make sure what you want get's published, either publish it your self on social media, or, convince someone in the group or outside of the group to publish. Just because you are part of the group, does not mean anyone has any obligation to contribute to your work. This is a loosely based meetup.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #3: Bring your skills. If you like being a reporter, if you want to do audio engineering, if you want to write music with true current social meaning, then this is an opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #4: Try to share your skills with others, there will always be video to produce, if you want to do video production, audio production, anything in the stream to create a news worthy news piece, this is your opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #5: Do this because you enjoy it, try to have fun, help others, try make meaning of the chaos.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #6: We attend public meeting using Open Meeting Law, in New Jersey this means you can only video speakers or officials, due to NJ draconian laws the public in a meeting has a 'right to privacy' at a meeting. In New York all present at meeting may be recorded. Recording can not interfere with an orderly meeting. NOTE: Every meeting will generate media to produce, I will generate it and provide it under Creative Commons, so if you are downstream of Video and Audio capture, don't worry, you will always have at least my work to work with. This is the second group I have founded, the first being \"(All Volunteer) Independent News Media\". <br>The idea is to, for example, if there is a hearing in Union County, to have it announced on all groups, so if you are the only member in Union wanting to attend, you would not be alone, you with luck would have some video and audio people from the Middlesex or Sommerset group helping out and vice-versa.<\/p>\n<p>I have been doing this for over two years now, and at times, major news papers will pick up the story and publish video made by freelancers like us. Equipment is not required, but $100 will get you some good equipment. One of my last video \"Feb 19th 2015: Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka wants Cami Anderson to remove herself from office.\" was done on under $500 of equipment all bought used off of Ebay and Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>I started this group when I found out that out of a city of 6+ million, there was no planned coverage of THE Post Ambrose LNG public hearing in Queens. It does not matter if you are a Conservative, Liberal, Progressive or any other affiliation. If you want to get involved with video production, this is an opportunity. For my personal work, I always publish creative commons, unless I included copy write material granted to me specifically for my production. Musicians and Sound engineers are badly needed.<\/p>\n<p>FYI <\/p>\n<p>BE PREPARED!&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Federal and State hearings for unpopular infrastructure projects happen many times in the dead of winter, on the coldest evening with virtually no public transit access.&nbsp; When I was at the Queens meeting it was dark and in the teens,&nbsp; I could not imagine any elderly person or sane person taking a multi-link trip to that location, and saw none waiting at bus stop.<\/p>If you want to be on the short list of people to be notified of short notice events, contact me.&nbsp; I always announce on the website, but sometimes less than 24 hours are given in advance notice. \n<br>","lon":-74.2799987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/a\/9\/highres_435731433.jpeg","photo_id":435731433,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/a\/9\/600_435731433.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/a\/9\/thumb_435731433.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":119445962,"name":"Leland  T.

Each meetup is focused on helping to identify common themes of interest in the group of people present then breaking up into action groups based on those themes.<\/p>\n<p><span>Our intention is to make it easier for people to connect with like minded people interested in building cool projects as a community.

The opera, skateboarding, graffiti, a little of the reckless (I am reckless at heart), photography... All those things here, while being able to be quiet with one another, transparent and sincere, or getting on an intellectual convo. A bit about moi: in my 20s, a musician, somewhat trans and going by the name Michael, can't understand why GAY can't encompass all of us, especially queer. I consider myself a queer a a result of how I dress and interact with the gender I am attracted to. In being trans, I am particularly interested in talking with trans folk who are truly \"open\", and thus not black and white, and thus, who would be open to discussing more of our estate in being trans, and what it means, and why and what we feel.

NOW YOU CAN! BUT IT ALL STARTS WITH THE RITE MINDSET. Welcome to the Entrepreneurship Lifestyle training Meetup. This free meetup will show you how to transform your life for the better by way of learning how to bring out your inner warrior. THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY BECOME SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE IS TO RELEASE YOUR INNER WARRIOR. My goal is to help people generate the energy and the mind-set necessary to become Warriors in Entrepreneurship. I am an Online Marketing mentor, Motivational Speaker and the mastermind behind the Mushindo Mind-set. I created the Mushindo Mind-Set to help bring out the inner Warrior in all hard-core Entrepreneurs. Through my study of both business and martial arts, I have honed my understanding of what it takes to get what you really want out of life. Education is only one part of the equation, however. I have now turned my knowledge into power by implementing powerful strategies from world-renowned authors such as Miyamoto Musashi, Bruce Lee, Robert Kiosiki, Napoleon Hill and many others into my own life and career. Now, my goal is to give life-changing knowledge and super-human skills at the Entrepreneurship Lifestyle training. By implementing The Law of Attraction principles, Martial Arts Philosophy, and all-powerful Alchemic thinking I can teach anyone with a desire for a better life how to attain it by culling their inner Warrior. Come meet my team of qualified pros and be a part of this amazing life-changing seminar to truly become a Successful Entrepreneurial Warrior.<\/p>","lon":-74.0100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":185615223,"name":"Shogun Rivera"},"members":50,"name":"ENTREPRENEURIAL WARRIORS","id":18526772,"state":"NJ","urlname":"WARRIORWITHIN","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.8899993896,"who":"Entrepreneurial Warrior"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1427757148000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript","id":7029},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"mobile-web","name":"Mobile Web","id":78586},{"urlkey":"javascript-frameworks","name":"JavaScript Frameworks","id":85951},{"urlkey":"app-developers","name":"App developers","id":303571},{"urlkey":"developing-mobile-apps","name":"Developing Mobile Apps","id":321161},{"urlkey":"open-source-community","name":"Open Source Community","id":729302},{"urlkey":"appreneurs","name":"Appreneurs","id":1068262},{"urlkey":"mobile-app-development","name":"Mobile App Development","id":1068282}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Source-Apps-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>A meet-up for for developers and entrepreneurs working to create open source apps.

I am launching The Last Minute Gourmet, right now and we are in prelaunch trying to build up a following (can't have events with 4 people showing up lol) The Single Gourmet, is mostly weekend dinners and the demographic trends on the higher side around 50+. The Last Minute Gourmet will be 90 percent midweek dinner events and a younger demographic than the Single Gourmet (but since we are pre-launch, I need to get some running ground by partnering with my current group). Being in pre-launch, I am offering some great discounts to new members that have NEVER been offered in our 33 years, which are free dinners if you sign up for full membership and dinner credits for inviting friends to become members. I also have a dinner group on facebook with over 600 members, that I will try to merge into The Last Minute Gourmet events soon. What i found with my facebook group is that people are non committal and collecting money for dinners is not easy. What I learned from The Single Gourmet is that you have to have a real set business to make dinner events really work and a membership base to make people accountable to their actions to other members and accountable to their RSVP. &nbsp;The Last Minute Gourmet will be s<\/span><span>ecret, after work, last minute dinner events texted and emailed to members.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Each event has a 45 min cash bar before the dinner, a price fix menu and is prepaid, so you do not split checks, nor worry about what others are eating\/drinking.

Do you like smiling, laughing and interacting with friendly folks out for a good time? Getting some healthy exercise while having fun? Contra dancing might be for you.<\/p>\n<p>Contra dancing is a fun, easy-to-learn style of social dance accompanied by a live band. Knowing how to dance is not necessary because a caller prompts the moves and guides the dancers. A workshop is given prior to the start to learn basic terminology and some of the dance moves.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the dance moves are identical to those in square dancing. People who learned some square dancing in elementary school\u2014even a few decades ago\u2014often pick up the basics of contra dancing quickly. And even if you\u2019ve never danced before, contra is one of the easiest kinds of dancing to learn.<\/p>\n<p>Much of the music is drawn from Appalachian, Celtic, and old-timey traditions, with pop, jazz, Eastern European and electric for good measure. From lively and playful to smooth and elegant, the music always has a great beat enhanced by the collective energy of joyful dancers.<\/p>\n<p>Many couples and singles attend the dances, and it's customary to dance with a variety of partners throughout an evening. Typically at a dance there are 40 to 80 people of varied experience levels, ages and backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>Swingin' Tern hosts contra dancing the first and third Saturdays of every month. Beginners are encouraged to come and try it out--experience not needed--and a beginners\u2019 workshop precedes the dance. Come alone, with a partner or with friends.<\/p>\n<p>In the contra community, Swingin\u2019 Tern is known both as a beginner-friendly dance group and the host of special dances that draw dancers from several states.<\/p>\n<p>LOCATION: The First Presbyterian Church Parish House, 14 Hanover Road, East Hanover, NJ <br>First and third Saturday every month.

We\u2019ve sung in several South African languages, Bengali, Japanese, Bulgarian, French, Yiddish, Croatian, and English.

Our rehearsals are joyful, playful, and very focused. We welcome anyone who can sing in tune, is willing to put time into learning their parts during the week using the practice tapes our director provides, and who can come to most of our Sunday afternoon rehearsals.

We meet quarterly at the Rutgers Inn and Conference Center in New Brunswick, NJ. This Meetup group is sponsored by DEVOLUTIONS (http:\/\/www.devolutions.com) The VMware User Group (VMUG) is an independent, global, customer-led organization, created to maximize members\u2019 use of VMware and partner solutions through knowledge sharing, training, collaboration, and events. The VMware User Group is a user community - of the users, by the users, for the users. Through an independent global VMUG, we believe we can strengthen our collective VMware and VMUG value proposition through expanded collaboration, member programs, and benefits. The independent global VMUG organization was officially launched in August of 2010. Prior to that point, VMUG chapters had operated locally with the support of VMware. These local groups grew rapidly \u2013 membership increased 234% in 2008-2009 alone. Because of this unparalleled growth, a decision was made to bring all of these chapters together under one global VMUG umbrella operating independently of VMware. The organization benefits the membership and VMware by: Ensuring a consistent and high quality experience for all VMUG members - Providing a more effective interface between VMware and our customer base Creating a cohesive network of VMware customers and partners with a collective voice capable of impacting VMware products and services Establishing a support system and business model that allows the local VMUG leaders and VMware to move beyond tactical support into more strategic initiatives In early 2010, a steering committee of VMUG chapter leaders was formed to chart the course for the launch and development of the global VMUG organization. From that steering committee, an inaugural volunteer Board of Directors was formed and the new global VMUG was launched to the membership at VMworld 2010.","lon":-74.4499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":185931941,"name":"NJ VMUG"},"members":75,"name":"New Jersey VMware User Group Meetup","id":18537006,"state":"NJ","urlname":"New-Jersey-VMware-User-Group-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.4900016785,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Leonia","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1428419912000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"reiki","name":"Reiki","id":1204},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"healing-circle","name":"Healing Circle","id":16650},{"urlkey":"stress-relief","name":"Stress Relief","id":17075},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"support","name":"Support","id":19925},{"urlkey":"reiki-share","name":"Reiki Share","id":20779},{"urlkey":"guided-meditation","name":"Guided Meditation","id":21628},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"holistic-health-and-wellness","name":"Holistic Health and Wellness","id":116356},{"urlkey":"shamanic-healing-energy-healing-reiki","name":"Shamanic Healing Energy healing Reiki","id":1430042}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TheHealingHouseNJ\/","rating":4.9,"description":"This group is for anyone interested in Reiki, Meditation and Holistic Healing and especially for those who love to share, learn and grow from amazing experiences with wonderful people!

In 2004, a french guy (Olivier Lafay) developed a training method that relies completely on your body weight and his method became a bestseller in the sports category in France.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The method consists of a plan to develop your muscles without using any machines, painful exercises or dedicating hours to training. The core idea is to promote steady evolution of your fitness level by increasing the intensity of the activity and let the muscles heal, rest and grow. This is also where the method is 'revolutionary': while many methods recommend spending hours at the gym, the Lafay Method has a different approach with less time for equivalent results.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>As you move along in the program, It will help you to maintain your upper body in better shape and develop the core muscles of your body. In the long run, it will definitely help you: you will feel less sore and probably run faster.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I discovered this method 2 years ago. Within only 2 months I felt a real change, it improved my fitness level significantly by increasing my core strength and my flexibility. So far, I have not seen any disadvantages: no gym fee, easy, no need to wait for a machine and I can practice even when traveling! I train 3 times a week (Macombs Dam Park, by the Yankee Stadium), and I will be pleased to give back to anyone what I learned and gained from that method on how to use it.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Contact me through here or at bournery@gmail.com !

I belive that the best way to learn is through immersion. This meetup's purpose is to create a French environment where when you step into it you will be required to speak French whether perfect or with many mistakes. The environment will have French music, eventually French appetizers, wine and of course you! I will highly encourage people to speak to each other even if you are shy you will feel welcomed! To qualify for this group, you must have at least a basic knowledge of French for basic conversation . If not at least try to learn 50 words before coming.

Join me and a wonderful group of friendly, non-judgmental men for some shopping at the Grand Army Farmers Market, followed by a picnic in Prospect Park. This is a fun, social way to do your grocery shopping and then hang out and meet new people for a picnic. Plus, if you're a first-time shopper at the market, I'm happy to help you navigate it and learn more about the whole foods they offer. I'll put out some free produce and cheese for the picnic, and others can pitch whatever they'd like to make it a feast. This is super casual, so feel free to bring a frisbee, instrument, blanket, etc. I'll bring a cooler for you to store any cold foods you bought at the market, plus I'll bring some cups and drinks (let's keep this alcohol-free!). This is all about building a cool community, meeting new people, being supportive, eating local, quality food and kicking off the weekend with some positivity. Why not avoid the brunch wait, and instead come enjoy the sun, fresh air, and good company?

Our mission is to provide progressive activists and professionals with a mutually supportive and positive learning environment in which every member has the opportunity to develop communications and leadership skills, which in turn foster self-confidence and personal growth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What happens At a Greenspeakers meeting?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our meetings generally start with an inspirational welcome message from a club member who introduces the Toastmaster for the evening. The Toastmaster is the Master of Ceremonies and leads us through the rest of the agenda.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here is a typical agenda:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Introductions: Each person briefly introduces herself or himself.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Agenda review: An experienced member explains what happens in the different parts of the meeting for the benefit of newcomers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Word of the day: A member presents us with an unusual word, defines it, uses it in several sentences, and challenges us to use it during the course of the meeting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Table Topics: An experienced member reads from a list of prepared questions and calls on members of the audience to give one-to-two minute responses. The questions aren't difficult; they are intended to give us a chance to practice speaking without preparation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Prepared Speeches: Two or three members deliver speeches that they have prepared in advance. These speeches can be about any subject, but they generally fall into one of ten categories defined by Toastmasters International. Most speeches are between five and seven minutes long. \u2022Evaluations: Experienced members, chosen in advance, evaluate each of the prepared speeches. These evaluations are supportive; they describe what the speaker did well and how the speaker could improve. Evaluations are two to three minutes long.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Self-evaluations: Each prepared speaker gets a minute to tell us how she or he felt while preparing and delivering the speech.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6The Time-keeper has been timing every speaker, and lists how long each of us spoke.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6The Um-counter tells us how many times each of us used filler words such as \"um,\" \"uh,\" \"you know,\" and \"like.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6The General Meeting Evaluator reviews and gives us feedback about all aspects of the meeting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Business meeting: The club President conducts a short business meeting. Club officers make reports and club policies are sometimes discussed. \u2022Voting: We vote for the best impromptu speech during Table Topics, the best prepared speech, and the best evaluation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u2022Final Go-Around: We go around the room and each person briefly gives us feedback about the meeting.<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11024723,"name":"Jeanne"},"members":149,"name":"Greenspeakers\/Toastmasters Public Speaking Club Meetup","id":18541743,"state":"NY","urlname":"Greenspeakers-Toastmasters-Public-Speaking-Club-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Toastmasters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Parsippany","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1428698358000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"forextrading","name":"Forex Trading","id":8431},{"urlkey":"futures-trading","name":"Futures Trading","id":16268},{"urlkey":"currency-trading","name":"Currency Trading","id":16269},{"urlkey":"technical-analysis","name":"Technical Analysis","id":17232},{"urlkey":"stock-trading","name":"Stock Trading","id":17234},{"urlkey":"equities-trading","name":"Equities Trading","id":19268},{"urlkey":"stocks-and-options","name":"Stocks and Options","id":19809},{"urlkey":"stock-investing","name":"Stock Investing","id":22016},{"urlkey":"options-trading","name":"Options Trading","id":24425},{"urlkey":"stock-market-trading","name":"Stock market trading","id":24472},{"urlkey":"trading","name":"Trading","id":26906}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-Jersey-Trading-and-Investing-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Traders and investors of all experience and skill levels who are actively involved in stocks, options, futures, commodities, currencies or other major financial markets.

You're also welcome to bring any game you want to play! We're very friendly and if you have no idea what the hell we're talking about just trust us when we say it's ton of fun. We'll have tons of games and we're very happy to show you the rules. Hang out, haves some drinks, and learn a new game!<\/p>\n<p>* (or monetary equivalent in non-alcoholic purchases if you don't touch the stuff.) Questions? Comments?

And don't worry -- we do it with fun and style, not with drippy, in-your-face, self-righteous militantism. En \"V\" yourself and have a good time doing it. That's the deal -- for $20, which you'll spend in the first half hour of bar and event hopping anywhere in NYC, you'll connect with and support plant-based power communities and meet over 100 very social, very fun health &amp; wellness-conscious professionals, eat and drink amazing vegan fare, hear incredible speakers, and party hard for an amazing cause. Make your nights out count!

Going to a gym can be intimidating. Between all the machines, learning how to use them, doing the exercises correctly and in the right quantities almost takes a degree to figure out. Personal training was expensive, and even the newer offerings like Crossfit were both very intense as well as expensive.<\/p>\n<p>You also have the challenge of motivation and commitment. All but the strongest minds have the strength to continue working out for any period of time on their own. Don't get me wrong, it can be done, and my highest respect to those that can do it, but for many of us, solo workouts, be it a walk, jog, or other exercise regimen, just lack the interaction and support that people want and need, especially beginners.<\/p>\n<p>I have struggled with my fitness over the years, between my weight and my physical abilities. While i'm no athlete, I have worked my way through numerous programs and exercise regimens, from gym memberships and personal training, to martial arts, boot camp, and even Crossfit. Most of those \"experiments\" lasted a few months at best to a few weeks at worst.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some I did stick with for a year or longer, and the common bond with those was the ability to achieve milestones and see my improvements more regularly as well as having a group of like minded people around me for support and encouragement. People who were more fit than I encouraging me, and people who were at my level, sharing in the experience. It also provided me an opportunity to help the newer people when they came aboard, to encourage them and give them the confidence that they can do this too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is where The Long Island Fitness Team (LIFT) comes in. Were a community of people who want to be fit. We're not the athletes and body builders of the world, just everyday people who are looking to become more fit, are looking for a program that will help them be consistent and keep them motivated, will help them improve their overall level of fitness, which will include cardio as well as strength and conditioning, and do so in a fun, team spirited, but very individualized and effective manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We cater to the beginner, Why? Because once you set up a routine, and once you understand what to do, and how to do it, when you know how to break down an exercise, or scale a workout to your own strength and ability, continuing is easy. You'll be more interested in getting out and exercising than taking it easy and doing nothing. You'll miss it. At that point, you'll also be able to make your own decision as to what kind of program you want to be a part of. Perhaps you'll go to a gym, do Yoga or Zumba, Boot Camp or Crossfit or even stay with us at LIFT. Who knows, maybe you'll workout alone. The importance here is that you got yourself to a level where YOU can decide how to stay fit. You will be free to control your future because of your fitness level rather than being confined and restricted by it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.5800018311,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/8\/b\/highres_438394699.jpeg","photo_id":438394699,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/8\/b\/600_438394699.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/8\/b\/thumb_438394699.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":186822598,"name":"Jim Goldfuss"},"members":30,"name":"Long Island Fitness Team (LIFT)","id":18572613,"state":"NY","urlname":"Long-Island-Fitness-Meetup","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Friends"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430562939000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"scifi","name":"Sci-Fi\/Fantasy","id":317},{"urlkey":"teachers","name":"Teachers","id":391},{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"museum","name":"Museum","id":7319},{"urlkey":"science-technology-engineering-math","name":"Science Technology Engineering Math","id":68682},{"urlkey":"robots","name":"Robots","id":72762},{"urlkey":"stem","name":"STEM","id":375271},{"urlkey":"stem-education","name":"STEM Education","id":415742},{"urlkey":"women-in-engineering","name":"Women in Engineering","id":829042}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/STEMgurusandguzzlers\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>I have a space in East Harlem where I would like to gather together with other \"STEMgurus\" and guzzlers of STEM - people interested in science, technology, engineering, and math - to create, teach each other, get others excited and engaged about new tech, old tech, etc. Makers and breakers welcome!<\/p>","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":6082225,"name":"suman "},"members":25,"name":"Calling all STEMgurus & STEMguzzlers in East Harlem!","id":18572949,"state":"NY","urlname":"STEMgurusandguzzlers","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.7799987793,"who":"STEMgurus"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430583604000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"urbanexplor","name":"Urban Exploration","id":4331},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"exploring","name":"Exploring","id":17522},{"urlkey":"city-exploration","name":"city exploration","id":18942},{"urlkey":"explore-local-area","name":"Explore Local Area","id":30535},{"urlkey":"city-walks","name":"City Walks","id":113737},{"urlkey":"exploring-new-york-city","name":"Exploring New York City","id":131810}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/City-Explorers\/","rating":0,"description":"Group for those interested in walking around in the city in new places, discovering new things.","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":115796622,"name":"Katie "},"members":268,"name":"City Explorers","id":18573217,"state":"NY","urlname":"City-Explorers","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Explorers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"South Ozone Park","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430585781000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"womens-fitness","name":"Women's Fitness","id":15123},{"urlkey":"group-fitness-training","name":"Group Fitness Training","id":15394},{"urlkey":"personal-training","name":"Personal Training","id":18628},{"urlkey":"fitness-boot-camp","name":"Fitness Boot Camp","id":20087},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"strength-conditioning","name":"Strength & Conditioning","id":25789},{"urlkey":"strength-and-endurance","name":"Strength and Endurance","id":62526},{"urlkey":"muscle-toning","name":"Muscle Toning","id":147532}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/danfitstudiosfitnessbootcamp\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Whether you are interested in weight loss, improving and\/or developing your muscular strength, or toning and sculpting or just simply becoming more active, come join us for a total body workout.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>All ages and fitness levels are welcome.&nbsp;Let's have fun together as we encourage and motivate each other to reach our fitness goals. <\/p>\n<p>We meet every Saturday at 8:00am.

We \"fall for\" the same kind of man over and over again and experience the same disappointments, the same hurts, the same hopelessness. We use a tremendous amount of energy dealing with these emotions instead of bringing our precious talents and beautiful spirits to the world. It is time to end this circle and move towards abundance that is available to all of us.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Learn how to turn your wounds into tools of self exploration and self growth. Understand the patterns of your subconscious attractions in order to bring into your life more of what you desire.

Become a Powerful Woman you know yourself to be.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I know you have a mission. This mission requires a lot of your energy and attention. The world needs all your gifts, all your love, and all the beauty you have to share.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is an experiential group where you get to practice various emotional processing techniques like movement, vocalizations, and breathing. You will also interact with others and have an opportunity to share your experiences.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We are all fighting the same battle for love and happiness.

Digital Marketing Hive was born out of that experience and went from making zero dollars a month to making me a full-time living in a little over two years. And I did this working only four hours a day. Today I live a great lifestyle by spending my summers in Montreal, Canada, Spring in New York City, USA and the rest of the time traveling.

Organized by the Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains, the Danger Zone March will begin at 1:00 p.m. at Sagamore Park (at Windsor Road at Beatrice Street), and conclude with a 2:30 p.m. rally in Teaneck\u2019s Votee Park (at Palisade Ave. and Court Street). &nbsp; The event will feature speakers from civic, environmental and religious groups and elected officials and live music. Up to 30 times a week, trains more than 100 tanker cars long haul hundreds of thousands of gallons of the volatile crude oil from Albany to Philadelphia refineries, crossing reservoirs and sensitive waterways including over the Oradell Reservoir (source of drinking water to 800,000 people in Bergen and Hudson Counties) and through 11 Bergen County towns. The oil trains then pass through densely populated Jersey City and Union; under major highways Routes 4 and 80 and I95; and next to Liberty National Airport. We'll focus attention on the catastrophic effects a derailment or other accident would incur, making stops at the Ambulance Corps, Benjamin Franklin Middle School, playgrounds and ball fields, a senior center, a day care center, and Teaneck\u2019s energy substation. The Chip Shelton Quartet will march with us in a New Orleans-style funeral march, to signify the imminent, mortal danger these unsafe trains place on people living in the blast area.&nbsp; People of all ages and abilities are welcome to join the family-friendly march. To assist people with limited mobility, The Bus for Progress, a non-profit organization that literally \u201cmobilizes\u201d citizens for just causes, will transport up to 40 people along the route. Hybrid and electric cars and other alternative fuel vehicles are welcome to join the vehicle convoy.&nbsp; Because the US Department of Transportation\u2019s new rules for high-hazard flammable trains (issued on May 1, 2015) fall far short of significantly reducing the risk to track-side communities, Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains calls for an immediate stop to routing unsafe oil trains on a rail line through 11 Bergen County towns; transparency with the public on what hazardous materials the trains carry and when; and immediate investment in renewable energy. Paula Rogovin, founder of The Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains explains, \u201cThe new rules convince us that government has failed to protect the public. For example, the phaseout of the most dangerous cars, the DOT 111s,&nbsp; is&nbsp; not required to take place until 2017. Most of the oil trains we see on the River Line are DOT 111s. Inadequate breaking systems are not required to be replaced until 2021. In Lac-Megantic, Quebec, 47 people died, much of the downtown was destroyed, and water remains contaminated after the 2013 derailment of train cars carrying Bakken crude. In recent months trains with Bakken crude exploded like bombs in Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, and Ontario. Accidents don\u2019t wait to happen. Our lives are at risk right now. Transport of Bakken crude oil is unacceptable. Keep Bakken crude in the ground.\u201d \u201cSo far in New Jersey we have been very lucky. There are at least 50 oil trains a week passing through our state and many more coming each day. These trains are a disaster waiting to happen. There have been many derailments and there seems to be one every couple months. So far the derailments have happened in mostly rural areas. If one of those derailments happened here in New Jersey, which is the most densely populated state in the nation, there could be a catastrophic loss of life. Even though there are proposals to make these trains safe, they are unsafe at any speed. That\u2019s why Sierra Club is in federal Court to try to block these trains from being on our rail lines,\u201d said Jeff Tittel, Director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. \u201cThis oil is not only the most flammable, it\u2019s the most explosive, and no matter how you ship it there will be serious disasters. Many of these trains run through major water supply areas and a spill could wipe out the New Jersey water supply for months to come. One quart of oil contaminates one million gallons of water. One rail car carries 34,500 gallons of oil and could wipe out Bergen County\u2019s water supply. We are playing Russian roulette with these train cars and that\u2019s why they need to be banned. They should be banned&nbsp; now.\u201d Rosemary Dreger Carey, an organizer for 350NJ, says, \u201cTransporting highly volatile oil by any means--train, pipeline or barge--is inherently unsafe. And it is unnecessary because we have the technology and natural resources right here in New Jersey to switch to clean, safe renewable energy.\u201d The Danger Zone March is one of six grassroots events happening across New Jersey and New York to oppose risky and unnecessary area fossil fuel infrastructure projects, such as the Pilgrim Pipeline and Port Ambrose LNG (liquid natural gas) facility.&nbsp; Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains Co-sponsors: 350NJ&nbsp; \u2022 350NYC \u2022 Bergen County Green Party&nbsp; \u2022 Bergen SWAN&nbsp; \u2022 Bronx Climate Justice North &nbsp; \u2022 Bus for Progress&nbsp; \u2022 Center for Biological Diversity \u2022 Chuck Aughenbaugh, Deputy Fire Chief (Ret.)&nbsp; \u2022 Clean Water Action \u2022 ClimateMama \u2022 Coalition of 100 Black Women \u2022 Environment New Jersey&nbsp; \u2022 Ethical Cultural Society of Bergen County&nbsp; \u2022 Food and Water Watch NJ * ForestEthics \u2022 Friends of the Greenway \u2022 Franciscan Response to Fracking \u2022 Girl Scout Cadette Troop 19 \u2022 Hackensack Riverkeeper \u2022 NJ League of Conservation Voters \u2022 NY\/NJ Baykeeper \u2022 North Jersey Public Policy Network&nbsp; \u2022 Moms Clean Air Force \u2022 NJ League of Conservation Voters \u2022 North Jersey Public Policy Network \u2022 Northeast Teaneck Block Presidents Association (12 groups) \u2022 Pascack Sustainability Group&nbsp; \u2022 Puffin Cultural Forum&nbsp; \u2022 Renewable Energy Task Force * Western New York Peace Center&nbsp; \u2022 SANE Energy Project&nbsp; \u2022 Sierra Club of New Jersey \u2022 South Greenwood Neighborhood Association, Jersey City \u2022 Teaneck Community Charter School \u2022 The Mothers Project","lon":-74.0699996948,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8681090,"name":"Rosemary Dreger Carey"},"members":9,"name":"Danger Zone March & Rally to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains","id":18586588,"state":"NJ","urlname":"https-www-facebook-com-350NJ-ref-hl","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.9500007629,"who":"350.orgNJ\/Coalition2BanUnsafeOil"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431224731000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"social-media","name":"Social Media","id":15401},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"harlem-nyc","name":"Harlem, NYC","id":15804},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"digital-marketing","name":"Digital Marketing","id":22773},{"urlkey":"hustle","name":"Hustle","id":32271},{"urlkey":"marketing-strategy","name":"Marketing Strategy","id":38528},{"urlkey":"lean-startup","name":"Lean Startup","id":38660},{"urlkey":"venture-capital","name":"Venture Capital","id":38968},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/UptownTechMeetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Who says the only tech &amp; startup scene is downtown or in BK?&nbsp;<span>Calling all Uptown Techies &amp; &nbsp;Startup-minded people serious about building companies &amp; up for a good time while doing so!<\/span><\/p>","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":83946362,"name":"John Henry"},"members":315,"name":"Uptown Tech Meetup","id":18586674,"state":"NY","urlname":"UptownTechMeetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Uptown Hustlers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431226423000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"naturism","name":"Naturism","id":5930},{"urlkey":"nudist-naturists","name":"Naturist","id":23517},{"urlkey":"clothes-free-living","name":"Clothes Free Living","id":39391},{"urlkey":"clothing-optional-recreation","name":"Clothing Optional Recreation","id":39871},{"urlkey":"naked","name":"naked","id":43244},{"urlkey":"nudity","name":"Nudity","id":43245},{"urlkey":"nude","name":"nude","id":69956},{"urlkey":"indoor-nudist-friends","name":"Indoor Nudist Friends","id":110279},{"urlkey":"nudist-dinner","name":"Nudist Dinner","id":150665},{"urlkey":"naked-house-parties","name":"Naked House Parties","id":223371},{"urlkey":"naked-hanging-around","name":"Naked hanging around","id":1456202}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-City-Indoor-Nudist-Friends\/","rating":3,"description":"<p>This group is for those who are seeking nude or clothing-optional, indoor activities to do within the five boroughs of New York City.

There are many forms of violence that we deal with, directly or indirectly, every day. Physical violence\/threats, racial violence and discrimination, sexual\/gender violence, and economic violence are probably the ones most clearly recognized, but there are more subtle forms as well (psychological, moral violence.) The only way to transform violence is through practicing nonviolence. But what does it mean to practice nonviolence? It involves understanding the root causes of violence, both within ourselves and in others. It\u2019s also about cultivating an attention or mindfulness in ourselves and learning tools that we can use to change our behavior towards others and transform the situations of violence in which we find ourselves. The Community (for human development) are neighborhood-based groups of study, discussion, shared experience and social action. The Community is formed by people interested in the development of a new culture that rejects violence and places the human being as its central value. Recognizing the link between personal change and social change, The Community offers readings, exercise, and seminars that help us to align the way we think, feel and act, overcome the lack of meaning, and build a less violent and more human world.","lon":-73.9199981689,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10325289,"name":"Dennis Redmond"},"members":17,"name":"The Community of Nonviolence Sunnyside","id":18590121,"state":"NY","urlname":"The-Community-of-Nonviolence-Sunnyside","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431367471000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wine","name":"Wine","id":611},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"film","name":"Film","id":15029},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"movie-nights","name":"Movie Nights","id":15940},{"urlkey":"new-york-city","name":"New York City","id":16809},{"urlkey":"trying-new-things","name":"Trying New Things","id":28744},{"urlkey":"spontaneous-fun","name":"Spontaneous Fun","id":30449},{"urlkey":"new-experiences","name":"New Experiences","id":34477},{"urlkey":"nyc","name":"NYC","id":39508},{"urlkey":"trying-new-things-with-like-minded-people","name":"Trying New Things with Like Minded People!","id":140995},{"urlkey":"try-new-experiences","name":"Try New Experiences","id":278391}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hooplas\/","rating":0,"description":"Let's get together for affordable and fun events &amp; activities in New York City.

So working with the Moon provides us with an opportunity to take the time to create SACRED SPACE for ourselves. It\u2019s necessary. There is something so powerful when women come together to support each other on their journey, in the hopes and dreams. We are healed, we are nurtured, we feel comforted and understood. Moreover, when you share sacred space with other women, you magnify the power of your intentions and you energetically create a web of support for not only your circle of women friends but with women everywhere. There is no judgment or criticism present. We are able to listen wholeheartedly to what each woman has to say, holding her in support and compassion. A circle also allows that everyone within it, is equal. Everyone and every expression is equally valued. We learn so much from one another. We witness each other, allowing ourselves to be seen and heard, honored, loved and enjoyed. These things go a long way toward strengthening us individually and collectively.

A few days later he found himself in the military camp, T2, outside of Goma, where he met five boys being held prisoner by the national army. The boys had been child soldiers, taken from their homes and forced to fight for rebel groups, until one night they escaped and ran to the national army for refuge. Now they were being treated as enemies of the state.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>He spent the day with the boys, trading stories laughter and tears. One boy told him of children too small to carry guns being sent to the front-lines, armed with only a whistle. Sean wrote to a few friends of this single story of a single day, who then forwarded it around the world. Thousands of strangers wrote back asking: what can we do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fallingwhistles.com\">Falling Whistles<\/a> is a non-profit organization campaigning for peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Our goal is to create a sustainable peace and to help local entrepreneurs rebuild their war-torn community. We work with Congolese visionaries, leaders creating progress in business, education, health and culture to create sustainable jobs and a sustainable economy. We raise our voices to advocate for peace and to help end one of the deadliest wars of our time. The movement and coalition though builds upon the involvement and commitment of whistleblowers from all over the world, and this is where you come in.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This is the start of the first NYC Whistler Society. We join a global network of local chapters dedicated to whistleblowing and together, we will start the conversation here in New York. We will develop innovative ways to get the attention of our community. We will support Congolese entrepreneurs through creating fundraising opportunities for their businesses and projects. We will wear our whistle as a symbol of peace. We will create a change.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Calling all whistle blowers!

Sometimes, a busy work week may prevent you from partaking in activities during the weekday so instead you prefer an excursion that is fun but yet inexpensive during the weekend. If this sounds like you, then perhaps this may be the group you've been looking for. Since I'm half tomboy meaning I like to hang up the heels from time to time so I can endure an exciting activity such as go karting, zip lining, and paint balling which allows me to act like a kid once awhile. Hey just because we're adults, that doesn't mean the fun have to stop! Right?&nbsp;<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<br>\n<p><b><i>And since my personality is chill but mixed with hilarity (I like to laugh a lot, you'll see) it's only right if we embark on chill activities as well. How about one Saturday we laff together at a comedy club to the point our stomachs tighten up from all of the internal giggling, or have a weekend BBQ if the weather permits, then engage in a low key get-together with coolers devouring quality but inexpensive food while sharing laughter and stories with one another, and when we do want to put on the heels lets chill at a lounge, or even better lets enjoy a Sunday Brunch on a beautiful Sunday early afternoon. I am from Jersey City, however I am currently located in Trenton. So, I decided to base the group in New Brunswick to which is a centralized location to my North and Central Jersey Gurls.&nbsp;<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Please note our activities will be located throughout Northern, Central, South Jersey and sometimes the City (NY) and Philly as well to accommodate members closer to those referenced regions. My goal is to create a group that exemplifies REAL friendship, while embracing REAL fun that demonstrates REAL \"RESPECT\" amongst one another. This group is not for FLAKY women and only for those that are willing to establish a real connection with myself and others that are in this group. The group will be kept relatively small as I want to get to know you gurls and hopefully we all can benefit from establishing a real lasting friendship that goes beyond this group.&nbsp;<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i>If you find yourself not able to attend an activity there is no need to select \"No\", if you can't attend. However, if you've have previously R.S.V.P. but are unable to attend at last minute just let me know. We all are human and other life circumstances will take precedence, I get it and completely understand. But, as a courtesy please alert me if you can't attend. I will dismiss those that are frequent offenders of the \"no show\", \"constant last minute cancels\", and \"no alerts\" as we're all adults, just be respectful of people's time and be conscious that it takes a lot of effort to coordinate the activities, as well as plan them.

Our meetings include public lectures, discussions, and practices all facilitated towards the awakening of our Essence (our True Nature) and the elimination of our suffering. We kindly welcome you to join us in the path of Self-Realization taught by so many Buddhas and Avatars before us. We teach in the tradition of Samael Aun Weor. May all beings be happy! <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/b\/f\/d\/highres_438408125.jpeg","photo_id":438408125,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/b\/f\/d\/600_438408125.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/b\/f\/d\/thumb_438408125.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":104624492,"name":"John"},"members":78,"name":"New York Gnostic Academy","id":18604230,"state":"NY","urlname":"gnosticacademy","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431883083000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"ruby","name":"Ruby","id":1040},{"urlkey":"python","name":"Python","id":1064},{"urlkey":"css","name":"CSS","id":1973},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"computer-science","name":"Computer Science","id":21751},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"html","name":"HTML","id":53518},{"urlkey":"frontend","name":"frontend","id":58131}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/team-pizza\/","rating":4,"description":"<p>This is a group for anyone passionate about learning programming, computer science, and how the internet works.

All I want to do is save some money while traveling with other Christians. I would go on one of those ministry trips, but they're really expensive since most of them are fundraisers. Not to mention the fact that we have to pay for their preachers and their entertainers. How about we keep things simple. Let's just pick a date to travel with our families to certain destinations. They have things for singles, alternative lifestyles, and every other group you can think of.&nbsp; So why not have something for Christian families? We can fellowship with one another while we're there, and have more fun than any entertainer can provide. We can do short trips, long trips, far trips, or close trips. We can even do something as simple and inexpensive as going to a state park together.&nbsp; Cruises are always fun too.

People are invited to partake in bringing their imagination to life, within the framework of an open-ended activity.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bodyliterate.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/photo-31-e1430147085966-225x300.jpg\"><\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>","lon":-73.9499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/6\/c\/0\/highres_438234976.jpeg","photo_id":438234976,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/6\/c\/0\/600_438234976.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/6\/c\/0\/thumb_438234976.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":186032707,"name":"Kai Kleinbard"},"members":37,"name":"Creative arts practices for children and adults","id":18611957,"state":"NY","urlname":"Brooklyn-Play-Theory-for-Creativity-and-the-Arts","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Playful beings"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Astoria","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1432137657000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"french","name":"French Language","id":185},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"expatfrench","name":"Expat French","id":3304},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147},{"urlkey":"french-culture","name":"French Culture","id":21183},{"urlkey":"family-friendly","name":"Family Friendly","id":22233},{"urlkey":"francophone-culture","name":"Francophone Culture","id":30474},{"urlkey":"preschoolers","name":"Preschoolers","id":30878},{"urlkey":"expat-french-french-speakers","name":"Expat French, French Speakers","id":34786},{"urlkey":"french-playgroup","name":"French Playgroup","id":39081},{"urlkey":"local-french-language-resources","name":"Local French Language Resources","id":40885},{"urlkey":"learning-french","name":"Learning French","id":46786},{"urlkey":"frenchie-play-dates","name":"Frenchie Play Dates","id":107727}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Astoria-French-Playgroup-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is group for any families interested by affordable and Fun activities in our neighborhood to teach and expose their kids to French.
