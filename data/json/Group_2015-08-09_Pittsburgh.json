      "description": "<p>Pittsburgh's Model & Photographer MeetUp is a group for Models, Photographers, MUAs and others who would like to get together for workshops, photoshoots, portfolio work, and networking.</p>\n<p>Monthly open shoots allow for both photographers and models to update their portfolios, hone skills, and show off changes in look or style. Our Group Shoots/Meetups are a great way to network, add to your portfolio, or just have a little creative fun.</p>\n<p><strong>We offer models TF* (No Charge!) portfolio building opportunities several tims a month.  TRUE portfolio building opportunity with different photographers and different props, and themes, with NO FEE other than your time to be there!</strong></p>\n<p>Models who show up always get quite a few usable images for their portfolios. So, it's a great way to make sure your portfolio always reflects your current \"look\" (hair, tan, weight, etc)</p>\n<p>Our workshops try to teach a skill or technique, not to just be a way to shoot some models. Models have a chance to earn a little money, and photographers have a chance to learn something, try something new, or add something to their portfolio they might not have had the ability or opportunity to do. Our picnics are just a fun time :)</p>\n<p>We have BOTH nude and non-nude events.  We DO NOT host \"adult\" events.   We concentrate on the artistic and creative.  <strong>NOTE:  As of June 2012 we are MOSTLY a NON-NUDE event group.</strong></p>\n<p>We teach the SKILLS you can use in your own photography, or modeling, to further your goals.  We do *not* teach you how to duplicate what we do, and we encourage EVERYONE to develop their own style, and to work within the parameters they are comfortable with.</p>\n<p>You are not required to attend every event.  Models are encouraged to participate since they benefit greatly with updated images in a variety of styles in exchange for their time.  Photographers get to work with models, learn new techniques, network, and have a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>This is one of THREE related groups.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Group 1: This group is the main Model/Photography group and has been around since 2002.</li>\n<li>Group 2: A new Pittsburgh Figure and Fetish Photography - \"Bodies as Art\" group, which will host the on-going nude/figure/art workshops and events. http://meetup.com/bodyart</li>\n<li>Group 3: An \"invitation only\" group for serious Figure/Erotic/Fetish work. http://meetup.com/eroticart</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That way you can pick the levels you are comfortable with.</p>\n<p>We suggest you join this group, first, since this group host the monthly group shoots, basic studio/lighting workshops, and is the most openly active.</p>\n<p> </p>",

I want you to develop a reader-base so you can get your imagined realities out there for other people to enjoy!</p>\r\n<p>So, what this group will be about is to help writers get their work(s) ready for publication, submission, and earn you a royalty/advance check!</p>\r\n<p>(Note: screenwriting and poetry are NOT our forte!)</p>\r\n<p>Will that be easy?  That, my friends, is up to you.

Some atheists refer to themselves as \"non-theists.\"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism#cite_note-2\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Agnostics</strong> separate out belief from actual knowledge.&nbsp; They think it is impossible or not currently possible to prove the existence or non-existence of any deity, creative force, or other religious belief.&nbsp; Agnosticism may also refer to having a skeptical approach to such questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Deists</strong> believe that observation and reason suggest the existence of a higher power, but stop short of proclaiming that we know who or what is responsible for the wonders of the universe. We don't yet know, and may never know.</p>\n<p><strong>Humanists</strong> <span>believe all humans have the ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives that aspire to the greater good of humanity.</span> They are committed to diversity, equality, an open and secular society, and to protecting the integrity and sustainability of our planet's resources.</p>\n<p><span><span><span><strong>Naturalism</strong></span> is the viewpoint that the laws of nature,</span> <span>as opposed to supernatural laws, are all that</span> <span>operate in the universe. &nbsp;Steve Irwin, Rachel Carson, Charles Darwin, and Beatrix Potter were all naturalists.</span></span></p>\n<p>Whether or not we use these labels, we endorse the exploration of our world through science,&nbsp;<span>rational thought, and</span> <span>evidence-based methods. &nbsp;We</span> embrace free inquiry, skepticism, and critical thinking.</p>\n<p>People of all faiths and non-faiths are welcome to join us for conversation and philosophic exploration. &nbsp;We welcome everyone!</p>\n<p>*PSF is also affiliated with The Center for Inquiry–Pittsburgh, and with the Pittsburgh Coalition of Reason. &nbsp;CFI sponsors local events to create a thriving community based on science, secularism, and Humanist values.

      "description": "<p><strong>Explore Pittsburgh's Restaurants &amp; Make New Friends!</strong> If you love trying new restaurants, making new friends, and exploring Pittsburgh; this is the Meetup for you! We're a mix of singles and couples of all ages. Everyone (21 and over) is welcome. Our events are mainly focused around food, but t<span>his is not just a dining group; <em>we offer many diversions for your Meetup pleasure</em>.</span> Typical events might be:  Dinners, Happy Hours, Wine Tastings, Pub Crawls, Brunches, Hikes, Concerts, Movies n' at. <em>*If you don't know what \"N' At\" means, Google \"Pittsburghese.\" (It's just \"Dining and that!\")</em><br>\n\n <strong><br>\n\n Pittsburghese Links:</strong><br>\n\n <a href=\"http://www.pittsburghese.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">www.pittsburghese.com/</span></a><br>\n\n <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_English\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_English</span></a><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Dining with strangers, and making new friends:</strong> When you join Dining N' At, you'll have the opportunity to dine at a variety of restaurants in the Greater Pittsburgh area! Together, we'll discover some incredible new places and delicious cuisine. It brings me great pleasure to share these places with you, the members. I invite you to come to a local dining and other related event to break bread n' at with fellow foodies and gourmets. Discover new restaurants, enjoy delicious meals, listen to live entertainment and make satisfying conversation with friendly dinner companions. <em>This group is intended for singles and couples AGE 21 AND OVER.</em><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Facebook Group:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=18155435619\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><br>\n\n www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=18155435619</span></a><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Future Questions:</strong> If you ever have any questions about a specific event, please contact the event's HOST, listed in the event details under \"SELECTED BY\" or at the top of the RSVP list under \"EVENT HOST.\" Click on the person's name, which is a LINK to his/her profile page. From that page, click \"Send Email\" to send that person your question. I am the main organizer for the group, but I can't answer questions about someone else's event. I have a wonderful team of event organizers who do a great job of planning a wide variety of dining and other events.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>RSVP Etiquette:  Please honor your RSVP!</strong> Our event planners do a lot of work to organize events. Please treat the group with the same respect you would show your own family and friends. If you RSVP \"YES\" and later find you can't attend, please change your RSVP to \"NO\" ASAP. If something comes up at the last minute, please call the event planner (if he/she has given a phone number) or call the restaurant or venue. Someone there can give your message to the event planner.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>FYI:</strong> It is not necessary to RSVP \"No\" for events you can't attend. This is ONLY needed when you change from a \"Yes\" RSVP to a \"No\" RSVP.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Wanted:  Event Planners!</strong> I am always looking for new people to become Event Organizers for Dining N' At. If you are interested in planning events, please read my guidelines here:  <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-dining-nat/messages/boards/thread/28322002\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-dining-nat/messages/boards/thread/28322002</span></a>.</p>\n<p>After reading the guidelines, if you are still interested, please send me an email with your phone number and the best time to reach you. I will call and discuss the duties of this volunteer position, as well as answer any questions you may have. It's fun and very rewarding, but there are some responsibilities involved. (Most of it is common sense, like making reservations at restaurants, asking in advance if they will write separate checks, etc.) My email is:  dnalansky AT yahoo.com. You can also email me from <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-dining-nat/members/3473332/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">my Meetup profile page</span></a>.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Wanted:  Event Suggestions!</strong> If you have a great idea for a future Dining N' At event, please send me an email and share your thoughts. I'm always looking for new and interesting restaurants to dine in, and places to explore in the Pittsburgh area. You can also start a new post on the Dining N' At Message Board to solicit opinions and get feedback from our members:  <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-dining-nat/messages/boards/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-dining-nat/messages/boards/</span></a>.</p>\n<p><strong>My Philosophy:</strong> It is my personal philosophy to avoid CHAIN RESTAURANTS like the plague, so you will not find any of my events taking place in that type of establishment. However, my assistant organizers are free to choose any location that suits them. I prefer to support small \"Mom &amp; Pop\" type local businesses here in the Pittsburgh area. The food is usually better, if not outstanding! Small, one-of-a-kind restaurants offer a unique experience that can't be duplicated IMHO.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>My Faves:</strong> Some new personal favorites of mine are Tin Front Cafe in Homestead near the Waterfront, Pan Alma Latin Kitchen in Regent Square, and Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park. I will occasionally go to a \"small chain\" restaurant, such as Mad Mex, or Emiliano's because they started in Pittsburgh, and still base their operations here...and their food is REALLY DELICIOUS!<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Thank you for your interest in Dining N' At. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions, thoughts or suggestions for the group. I look forward to meeting you at future events.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Best regards,<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Deena Alansky, Main Organizer<br>\n\n Pittsburgh Dining N' At Meetup Group</p>",

We offer you the opportunity to get outside through a variety of outdoor hiking events.</p>\n<p>Pittsburgh Hiking Meetup is run by volunteer leaders who love the outdoors and want to get people outside. We are not paid guides. We do this because we are passionate about being outdoors. We are outdoor enthusiasts like yourself.</p>\n<p>*Each volunteer determines what kind of hike they want to post.<br>\n\n * Each event has different expectations, directions and details. Please take time to read the details carefully and make sure the hike you are interested in is the right one for you.<br>\n\n * If you have questions about a specific hike, please email the specific hike leader directly.</p>\n<p>When a person hosts a hike, that person represents the Pittsburgh Hiking Meetup Group, and must follow the rules of the park (and enforce them to the hikers she or he is leading).  The group cannot risk being ejected from a park because of a few of its hikers.  This is also to ensure the safety of the dogs.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n If you host an event, you represent the group, and with this privilege comes the responsibility of following the law.</p>\n<p><br>\n\n ALL DOGS on hikes with our group must be leashed at ALL TIMES.</p>\n<p>If you have suggestions for hikes, or general questions about hiking, please use the Message Board.</p>\n<p>We all look forward to meeting you on the trail!</p>\n<p>One more very important thing....<br>\n\n When participating in Pittsburgh Hiking Meetup events, it is assumed that all participants are responsible for their own safety and of their dependents (such as children) at the event. The facilitator is simply providing an opportunity for everyone to enjoy the event together and is not assuming responsibility or liability for the safety of the participants.</p>",

I hope you can join us at our monthly meetings - bring along a favorite game, or show up and try someone else's favorite.  Feel free to suggest new Game Meetup locations, days, and time -- especially if you want to host!</p>\n<p>In addition to playing my favorite games Scattergories and Taboo, we have shared and played many games, such as: Apples to Apples, Boggle, Card Sharks, Cranium, Die Händler, In A Pickle, Jamaica, LoudMouth, Locos, Mexican Train, Password, Puerto Rico (euro game), Quelf, Rack-O, Risk! (Star Wars Version), Santiago, Scrabble, Ticket to Ride, Ticket to Ride Europe, TriBond, Whazit, Who Wants to be a Millionaire, Wits &amp; Wagers, and more.</p>\n<p>Sometimes we have to split into groups to play. Other members have enjoyed playing Metropolys, The Settlers of Catan, Modern Art, Merchant of Venus, Can't Stop!, Tigress and Euphrates, and Ivanhoe.</p>\n<p>If you bring the game, we will probably play it!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NEW FOR 2013:</p>\n<p>For every game meetup that you attend that I am hosting, your name will go in for a drawing for a grand prize at the end of the year. Therefore, if you attend every game meetup I host this year -- probably just the 12 at the library -- you will have 12 chances to win the big attendance prize!</p>\n<p>I may be having attendance prizes throughout the year ... you'll have to show up to find out!</p>",

In so doing, we continued in our historical tradition of making USA a more perfect union - where all men and women are created equal. A country where the dreams of our leaders are realized - that we judge men on the content of their character, not on the color of their skin - America's first African-American Commander in Chief.\r\n\r\nPittsburgh Proud voted in record numbers to help elect Barack Obama. You chose a man that'll: fix our economy; repair our standing in the world community; provide top quality education; restructure the health care system; and bring peace and security to Iraq and other forward areas.\r\n\r\nBarack Obama Pittsburgh Group of Hope is proud of it support for Barack Obama thru the primaries and the general election. Some of us register voters, others lead teams of volunteers, but all of us held out hope that he would win and bring change to Washington. We are proud of our efforts and are dedicated to the continued support of Pres. Barack Obama and assist in his effort to continue in our historical tradition of making the USA more perfect union.\r\n\r\nThank-you!",

We love to meet people and always enjoy good company and conversation. Vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores are welcome.

A vegan does not consume: meat, fowl, fish, seafood, eggs, dairy products (milk, cheese, whey, casein, butter), gelatin, honey, beeswax. Also, does not wear: leather, fur, silk, or wool. (If you are preparing a dish for a meeting and need to confirm the ingredients are vegan, please contact the Group Organizer, Michelle.)</p>\n<p>Please check out our calendar to see if there's an event that you're interested in attending! It would be great if you could RSVP in advance so we know how many seats to reserve!

      "description": "<p>Welcome Non-Native Pittsburghers and returning natives!</p>\n<p>This group was initially organized by Kellie Gormly, a Texas transplant, and was transferred to Katherine O. in March 2010, and as of May 2012, I have been asked to organize.</p>\n<p>Pittsburgh may have a lot to offer, but it’s more fun to do it with other people.  You can be single or married, non-native or even a native who has moved away and come back to join this group. Our typical member is mid twenty-something to forty-something, with a sprinkling on either end of the age scale. Just come out and join us for some conversation and see who you meet and what you learn.</p>\n<p>Pittsburgh is a wonderful city, however it can be very difficult to make friends. This group was started by Kellie to help women, who have not been here their whole lives, connect with other women.</p>\n<p>To join our group, we do ask for a few basics:</p>\n<p>1) You need a profile picture so that we can recognize you. Our organizers can sometimes find you quicker than you can find them in crowded places. Walking up to strangers and asking if they are there for a meetup gets you some funny looks (been there, done that).<br>\n\n 2) Please answer the profile questions so people can learn about the folks they are coming out to meet. People can send messages before and after they meet you. Sometimes it’s fun to find a new member from your home country, state, or town.<br>\n\n 3) You have to agree to not SPAM the group in any way, shape, or form.<br>\n\n 4) We do everything possible to foster an open environment, and request that all members give everyone “consideration”.  Anyone making members feel uncomfortable will be removed from the group.<br>\n\n 5) Our group is as good as the people and the activities. If you see someplace you'd like to try out, add it to the message board and we can make a meetup of it. If you are interested in becoming an event organizer, please let me know. We welcome additional interest in organizing events.</p>\n<p>6) If you have not logged onto the group in approximately 6 months or longer, we will remove you from the group.  If you find this has happened, just resubmit a request to join and you can be added again.</p>\n<p>7) We will charge yearly $5 dues to be a part of this group. Many people don't realize that the organizer pays from their own funds to keep the site going. The dues will help cover costs of the meetup website. If we wind up with a surplus we will announce an event and the group will cover some or all of the costs for all who attend.</p>\n<p>8) Out of respect to our organizers, we do ask that you change your RSVP if you have to back out of an event. It is ideal if you can update 24 hours ahead, but if not, please contact the organizer (most will give their cell phone number to attendees, in case of changes).  We will enforce a 3 no-show rule. If you don't update your RSVP and/or don't notify the event organizer prior to an event on 3 occasions, and \"no-show\", I will remove you from the group.</p>\n<p>Lastly, just get out there and join us.  Meetup face to face.  You don’t need to come to every meetup or even a majority, but I hope to see you out there at some point.  We look forward to meeting you all and making new connections!!<br>\n\n All the Best,<br>\n\n Kristen</p>",

      "description": "<p>\"Truth is treason in the empire of lies... There is an alternative to national bankruptcy, a bigger police state, trillion-dollar wars, and a government that draws ever more parasitically on the productive energies of the American people. It's called freedom... If we want to live in a free society, we need to break free from the artificial limitations on free debate and start asking serious questions once again. I am happy that my campaign for the presidency has finally raised some of them. But this is a long-term project that will persist far into the future. These ideas cannot be allowed to die, buried beneath the mind-numbing chorus of empty slogans and inanities that constitute official political discourse in America.\" From The Revolution: A Manifesto by Ron Paul This Meetup Group is intended to serve the continuing Ron Paul Revolution, specifically in the Pittsburgh and Western PA area. Regardless of the results of any one political campaign we will continue to follow the example and leadership of Dr. Ron Paul to bring about the restoration our liberties, our Constitution, and our cherished republic. We will take an active role in this endeavor.</p>",

Our events offer a unique way to make new friends and meet like-minded folks in a laid-back atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Please note our focus is on SOCIAL connections, not for professional networking or dating. If you're joining this group to advance a professional or romantic agenda, please seek membership in another group.</p>\n<p>We schedule casual gatherings in different locations as they seem appropriate; these can include not only \"happy hours\" and house parties, but outdoor activities including hikes, kayaking, et cetera.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This group is open to people of all professions, relationship statuses, races, sexual orientations, religious/philosophical beliefs, and ethnic backgrounds. All we ask is that you hold yourself to four standards of behavior: dignity, diligence, community, and responsibility.</p>\n<p>While this group is open to people who are approaching their 30s (i.e. 25+), membership in this group (especially for vicenarians) is contingent on people acting with the maturity expected of people in their 30s (tricenarians). If you're a member who has just turned 40, don't worry; we won't exacerbate your potential mid-life crisis by kicking you out of the group. But we will encourage you to consider joining a more age-appropriate group.</p>\n<p>You will be required to complete a brief questionnaire to introduce yourself this group (in keeping with our ethos of community) Your answers become part of your group profile and serve as your self-introduction to the group. Please answer them honestly.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to contact myself, Kristen, or any of the assistant organizers if you have any questions.</p>",

Whether it's an afternoon playdate or mom's night out, M.O.M will offer a chance to make some new friends (for you and your kids). With so many great kid-friendly locations in our area, there will be no shortage of fun places to meet-up. In an effort to include as many MOMs as possible (working or at-home), we will offer a variety of dates and times to hopefully suit everyone's schedule. M.O.M is also not just exclusively for mothers or residents of McCandless. We welcome fathers and even grandparents, too. Anyone who is the caregiver of a child in the North Hills of Pittsburgh is invited to join our group. This is simply an additional social outlet and source of support. Our goal is to create a community of families who live nearby and share the adventures of parenting together. <br>To learn more, please visit our About Us page at <a href=\"http://parents.meetup.com/904/about/\">http://parents.meetup.com/904/about/</a></p>",

This is a social group, it's not a professional or clinically based support group. The events will be social, meant to enjoy and have fun with other single folks. There is nothing wrong with dating within this group, but please keep in mind not all members are ready for a dating relationship. Approach with caution and respect other's boundaries.&nbsp;Consider meeting us for an event soon, or consider suggesting an event near you!</p>\n<br>",

It's a great way to meet new people without a huge time or money commitment (after all, it's just a cup of coffee or tea).</p>\n<p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>\n<p>Show up on or around the designated time and look for the host and introduce yourself to the group. Get yourself a drink (you're not required to drink coffee, we don't discriminate) and pull up a chair. Group sizes range, so you may just be meeting two people or two dozen. You're welcome to bring friends along (feel free to mention that in your RSVP) but don't worry if you're coming alone, we're not that scary.</p>\n<p>The conversation should be light, humorous, entertaining, and mostly positive. It's a blast, try it you'll like it. :)</p>\n<p><strong>Be a Host</strong></p>\n<p>If you're interested in hosting your own event, feel free to contact me or post a suggestion in the group. I'd love to have new event organizers. Please keep in mind that suggested events must be somewhat coffee or tea related, and I reserve the right to remove events that are not.</p>",

Share knowledge and wisdom for growth and support. Even if you have never done tai chi or qigong, or even heard of taoist, but your interested in health and wellness you should still come and share your experiences and check it out. Come and share your experiences, your knowledge(even if it is of another spiritual art), and your practice. This group is about supporting our practice by practicing together.

It's basically that simple. We thought that it would be great if there was some meetup group here in the 'burgh that you could meet other MINI enthusiasts, without paying a membership fee for. Yes, it would be good if you owned a MINI, but what if you wanted to live vicariously through other MINI owners... We'd be happy to throw someone else in our boot! We're open to suggestions for events! We love to do rallies, garage days, track days, social events, drive-in movies, and tons of other fun stuff. Feel free to post suggestions on the discussion board.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ps. We've joined up with PittStopMINI so check out their <a href=\"http://www.pittstopmini.org/\">website</a> and feel free to join the club.  (You don't have to be a member to participate in meetup or PittStopMINI events.)</p>",

      "description": "<p>The Boston Tea Party was an act of direct protest by American Colonists demanding representation in the British Government. They became known as the original patriots. The Pittsburgh Tea Party of 2009 and Tea Parties all across America will reinvigorate that American and Patriotic spirit; one that demands respect for individual rights and property. As the bailouts spiral out of control, we are forced to fund failed banks. With foreclosures on the rise, we are made the collateral of reckless spending. And, when the bills come due, the IRS knocks on the door of &ldquo;self-responsibility&rdquo;. ENOUGH! America is the land of opportunity. To succeed AND to Fail. Without consequences, what is our incentive to learn? What is our incentive to produce? On July 4, 2009, those that ask nothing from the government but the protection of our inalienable right to succeed, will gather in Los Angees, Chicago, Boston, Pittsburgh and many other cities across this great nation in an historic act of direct protest. Dissent is the highest form of Patriotism. - Thomas Paine</p>",

This is <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/pghbulldogs\">The Pittsburgh English Bulldog Meetup Group</a> and we are looking to get together and have some fun with our wiggly butt Bullies. Bulldogs are more than just wrinkles, underbites and snoring. They are comedians with big hearts that define fearlessness. We usually meet once a month and will do our best to keep all Meetup events either free or very low cost. All we ask is that every member pitch in a <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/pghbulldogs/money\">once yearly membership fee</a> of just $5 (either via PayPal to mistylynn3@gmail.com or in person to Misty Pieffer) to help cover the cost of keeping The Pittsburgh English Bulldog Meetup Group going. Also, we want to send out a special invite to our cousins, the French Bulldogs. You are welcome to join the group and come to the Meetups as well. The more the merrier! And remember, a Meetup group can only be as good as the members in it. So we all need to join together and get involved. All members are encouraged to participate on the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/pghbulldogs/messages/boards\">message boards</a>, post <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/pghbulldogs/photos\">photos</a> of their beloved Bullies and of course attend the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/pghbulldogs/calendar/list\">monthly Meetups</a>. Please let the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/pghbulldogs/members/6744889\">Organizer</a> know if there is anything they can do to make this group a more successful one. See ya at the next Meetup!</p>",

All members are encouraged to recommend events for the group. The organizer and assistant organizer should be notified with all of the details and it will be posted on our calendar. Activities are generally  planned in areas that are centrally located. Driving outside of your area is encouraged as you will find new relationships and activities.   Membership is $10.00 a year and should be paid to the organizer yearly for upkeep of the website. Why should you join? Life is all about how you handle plan B, and we are here together to make new friends, and get out there and see what this city has to offer!!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I hope to see you at one of our upcoming events!</p>\n<p>Alicia</p>",

But we all still need to make a living and networking really does work SO we decided to combine a little happy hour with some healthy relaxation time. The result - an opportunity to meet other business owners, entrepreneurs and otherwise interesting people in a beautiful, private, fully-licensed and staffed Day Spa. And the best part is that you can have a massage or a facial or a manicure or pedicure at the same time. When you leave our get-togethers you will be relaxed, rejuvenated and befriended. Join us at our next event and get ready to Spaaaaaaaaaah. We usually schedule meetups after work to accommodate our busy schedules. The group and our events are open to women and men of any age. We also try to include the kids as we consider that the idea of spa should be a family affair.</p>",

This is not a therapy group, rather just a casual place where people dealing with the same issues can get together and talk without fear of being embarrassed or judged. Some of our meetings we sit and have good conversation about anything and everything. Other meetings we go out and do something fun together.</p>\r\n<p>Depression is also a large part of society these days, for a variety of reasons. Sometimes just getting out and being around other people can help relieve those feelings. We welcome anyone dealing with depression to join us at all of our meetups.</p>\r\n<p>I have dealt with shyness and general anxiety for as long as I can remember. It is extremely difficult for those of us with those feelings and fears to get out and meet new people. The goal of this group is to provide anyone who is interested with that opportunity.</p>\r\n<p>If this sounds like the group for you but you still might not be sure, send me an email with any questions or concerns you might have.</p>\r\n<p>-Justin Orison</p>",

As we like to say Witches, Pagans, Heathens, &amp; Sundry Folk. This is an open social group and a part of The Black Hat Society Network..<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Unity is what we like to hear; building community is what we want. This is the place where we build community one person at a time. I believe if you hold grudges and love the drama, this is not the place for you. Simple rules to follow...<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Bar none we have an awesome discussion board sharing of information. Also, we have members near &amp; far. Occasionally we will have speakers, classes, field trips, open rituals, fundraisers, mixers, awesome picnics, just to name a few things. We also hold an annual Witches Ball &amp; Samhain Celebration with Ritual &amp; Spiral Dance. No one in the Pittsburgh area can hold a candle to our event. We give you top entertainment, food, beverages, and it will be held in the city of Pittsburgh. We ask for a dollar a month in dues or $12 dollars annually. Most of our events are free, or for a small offering, other than the discounted ticket for the Witches Ball if you are a member. If you like to sponsor the group, one of the organizers can help you..<br>\n\n<br>\n\n We have five sites we keep up and maintain...<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Of course this is the meetup site<br>\n\n<br>\n\n You can find us here also...</strong></span></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tpbhs.com\">http://www.tpbhs.com</a></p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/PghBlackHats</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : medium\"><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/pages/The-Pittsburgh-Black-Hat-Society-Network/119300551432076?ref=ts\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/pages/The-Pittsburgh-Black-Hat-Society-Network/119300551432076?ref=ts</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : medium\"><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/The-Pittsburgh-Black-Hat-Society/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.meetup.com/The-Pittsburgh-Black-Hat-Society/</a><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <a href=\"http://thepghblackhatsociety.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://thepghblackhatsociety.blogspot.com/</a><br>\n\n<br>\n\n</span></p>\n<p>Brightest of Blessings from all the Organizers...</p>",

      "description": "You belong to Meetup and you've attended a meeting here and there.  You may also belong to LinkedIn, or Facebook, you probably are also tweeting.  But are you really getting what your want or need from those organizations?  If not, read on...\r\n\r\nThese forums are all serve a purpose, but wouldn't it be better to have an opportunity to join forces with a small group of business owners that have complementary skills and are willing and able to promote you.\r\n\r\nThis is an exclusive group of carefully selected business service providers that complement each other and are willing and able to build strong \"business building\" relationships with the other group members.  \r\n\r\nMembership in this group is not taken lightly; there are business and personal requirements that are highly recommended to be eligible for membership.  In addition, this group will be limited to 8 members in the following industries.\r\n\r\n-- Accounting Professional (CPA)\r\n-- Lawyer / Attorney\r\n-- QuickBooks Solution Provider\r\n-- Marketing professional\r\n-- Computer Services / IT Professional\r\n-- Website Development Professional\r\n-- Employee / Human Resource Benefits Professional\r\n-- Management Consultant Professional\r\n\r\nEssentially, this group will provide a network of business services that are essential to all small and mid-market businesses that do not have internal business services at their finger tips.\r\n\r\nWhat we are not:  We are not a group that meets once in a while and hopes to meet someone that we can get business from.  Our efforts will go beyond that.  Our goals will be to really help the other members of the group to prosper by building strong mature relationships with one another, and by combining our marketing efforts and promoting additional services; we will strengthen our network and essentially provide a one stop shop for small and mid-market businesses.\r\n\r\nWe do not take membership lightly and to ensure that our network is top notch, there are a number of qualifications listed below.  Please read this list carefully before deciding if you should apply to be a member.  \r\n\r\nThere will be a monthly 1-2 hour meeting that all members are expected to attend.  \r\n\r\nYou should plan to host meetings (preferably at your office) so that we can get to know each other well.  If you do not have an office, alternative arrangements can be made.\r\n\r\nYou should belong to at least 1 Chamber of Commerce (we will attempt to reach out to all of the larger chambers through our marketing efforts.) and you should actively participate in at least one additional networking group of your choice.\r\n\r\nYou should be able to provide at least 5 business references\r\n\r\nOwn your own business because your ability to add referral pages to your website, provide printed marketing material, and provide complimentary workshops cannot be inhibited by a parent company or franchise.\r\n\r\nYou should be in business for at least 3 years on a full time basis.\r\n\r\nYour educational / background should be related to the field your are working in now.\r\n\r\nYou must be willing to promote other businesses (you will know these businesses well, and will feel comfortable doing so.)\r\n\r\nYour business should not compete in any way with another business on the list.  For example, an attorney that prepares income tax returns need not apply, because our group will provide CPA services.\r\n\r\nYou must be willing and able to add a \"references\" page to your website, with Bios and Photos of the group members.  You should also have a professional photo and a bio available to share with the members for posting.\r\n\r\nYou should treat all clients and referrals received through this group with respect and show integrity as you work with them.  And never degrade another business in the group.\r\n\r\nYou must be willing to provide a free \"workshop\", \"clinic\", \"seminar\", or other type of promotional event that will be marketed to each of the other member’s clients or contacts.  This is one way where we will be able \"show our stuff\" so to speak and pick up new clients by providing valuable and relevant information to potential clients.  It will take some effort to market these events; however the results will be worth it.  Think about it...You'll have 7 people that are able to reach out to 25 contacts to let them know you are offering a free clinic.  It keeps them in touch with past clients too.\r\n\r\nYou have read this far, so we know you are interested.  And you know that this is a working group, not a networking group.  There will be efforts required on your part to make this work.  If you have the time to invest in the work and the ability to take on new clients, the desire to build strong relationships with folks that are in a similar situation to your own, can see the benefits of joining forces with others to increase your profitability, then you should apply today.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no fee to join; however, we may from time to time, collect modest fees for items such as printing, mailings, etc.",

Some were shocked, angry, and all of us saddened... Remember 9/12? We were united with a common purpose, there was no red state/ blue state, we were the United States standing together to protect the greatest nation ever created. Our group is founded on 9 Principles and 12 Values that are fundamental to our Country. We're creating a community of Americans who believe that the power rests with the people, not the politicians. Many Americans, both Republican and Democrat, understand that Washington is broken. Many times it seems that the political solution is the problem. No more. Our founders knew the solution is We The People. Meet with other common sense principled Americans to discuss and take action on local and national issues.

Whatever it is we can do so much more by supporting each other and helping each other out. If you feel a little out of place being so young and owning a business or being an innovator this is exactly what this group is for. And don't worry if your not sure where your path is yet, that is why we are getting together.... Once we get some people....we can plan to go do some cool things around town.....get to know each other....and hopefully collaborate on some awesome stuff. Until then keep the vision alive ~Tom</p>",

      "description": "<p>Transmission is a wonderful meditation which has a different purpose than other meditations. Its purpose is to bring healing transformative energies into the world. It couldn’t be simpler. Our group comes together and sounds The Great Invocation – a prayer given to the world in 1945 which essentially says \"let light and love and power restore the plan on earth\". As we recite this mantra, automatically through the law of invocation/evocation, these energies flow through the group then out into the world stepped down to a lower level so that the energies are more usable to more. It is a real service to perform and if you do so, your own life will be transformed. Why? Because you cannot open yourself to these spiritual energies and have them flow through you without having yourself blessed. We do it for service, but Transmission Meditation has this wonderful secondary effect on the people who participate. If you believe in a spiritual world and that energies condition all life, Transmission Meditation is a wonderful complimentary practice. We’re told hour for hour there is nothing better we could do for the world. So if you’re looking for a way to serve, a way to help, Transmission Meditation is a way. The Pittsburgh Transmission Meditation group meditates every Monday at 7 pm (6:45 intro) at Friend’s Meeting House located at 4836 Ellsworth Avenue in Oakland. All are welcome and always no cost. Call Sheila (412)221-5314 or email transmissionmeditation@verizon.net for further details &amp; location. For more information on Transmission Meditation please visit www.transmissionmeditation.org or www.share-international.org. Also sister Transmission group in the and North Hills. Please contact Sheila for more information.</p>",

The indigo are spiritually gifted individuals, but without the proper balance, guidance, and tools can very easily develop issues that will cause suffering.  It is possible that the many over diagnoses of childhood and adult mental illness are linked to this phenomenon, and with the proper guidance many of these children and individuals can be very successful. \r\n\r\nI am starting this group, because 13 years ago I suffered with childhood mental illness (ADD, ADHD, Bipolar, OCD, & Tourettes).   So, I know what it is like.  I have, since then, been able to overcome my mental illness and move into a spiritual life as an indigo that is balanced, and symptom and medication free for over the past 10 years using various techniques and mind-body practices.  I am hoping to share my experiences, and provide an outlet for others to share in order to inspire and facilitate growth and balance of these special children and adults.  \r\n\r\nWe have the power.  We just don't always know how to use it.\r\n\r\nLets come together and empower our youth to rise to the occasion that is their lives!\r\n\r\nI look forward to meeting you all\r\n\r\nSincerely\r\n\r\nTom M, Ph.B, LWC, TCQT\r\n-Life Coach, Speaker, and Tai Chi Teacher",

This is your chance! I started the blog to put out a good word for some of the great local restaurants that often don't have the marketing budget to really get the word out on their own. To further that theme, I have created the FoodBurgh meetup to give my readers a chance to assemble and get to know each place.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">So come on out and grab a salad (or a beer) with me and a handful of other FoodBurgh readers!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">--Mike</p>",

We can all relate to each other's sagas of being misdiagnosed and sick for many years and our meetups are a great time to get together and share stories and gluten-free tips. We are hoping this group will provide an opportunity for people to get together and learn about living Gluten Free while having fun.</p>\n<p>Celiac disease is a digestive condition triggered by consumption of the protein gluten, which is found in bread, pasta, cookies, pizza crust and many other foods containing wheat, barley or rye. Oats may contain gluten as well. When a person with celiac disease eats foods containing gluten, an immune reaction occurs in the small intestine, resulting in damage to the surface of the small intestine and an inability to absorb certain nutrients from food.</p>\n<p>Gluten intolerance means just that, a person reacts negatively when they products containing gluten.  This intolerance to gluten can have many causes but still necessitates a gluten free lifestyle.</p>\n<p>We encourage people to join who have Celiac disease, are gluten intolerant, are gluten free by choice, or have friends or family members who are eating Gluten free. We plan to have Meetup events for our group that include: gluten-free dinners, happy hours with gluten-free beer, food and product focus groups, gluten-free cooking sprees, vendor fairs, gluten-free discounts, lectures, and much more.</p>",

      "description": "<p>This is a paid membership, mostly invitation only group.</p>\n<p>There is a small group of us who have been working/shooting together for years, and this group is going to *try* to be the expansion of that into a more coordinate, \"fetish\" and \"erotic art\" workshop group.  WORKSHOPS.  That means learning, doing, and creating.  Not sitting around.</p>\n<p>Fetish photography is expensive, and this is an intense group for working with the artistic concepts of fetish/art photography, and erotic/art photography.  If you are looking for or thinking this group will be about about spreads, insertions, or \"adult\" images, you are wrong.  Dead wrong.</p>\n<p>Workshops will have fees to attend, to help pay for props and model expenses.  You are expected to attend a reasonable number of events which helps fund the group.  Just paying the membership fee is not enough to keep a group like this running.  If you don't understand and accept that, this is not the group for you.</p>\n<p>Many people have tried to start and maintain photography/fetish/erotic/art groups.  The largest single point of failure is MONEY.  This is EXPENSIVE.  Photography is EXPENSIVE (even with the digital cameras making it _cheaper_ than it ever was, it is still EXPENSIVE!).  Fetish photography is even more so.  Good fetish gear for a basic shoot can cost in excess of $2000 PER MODEL!  Large, stationary props that can cost in excess of $10,000. We have run groups for almost 3 decades, and understand what it takes to start, run, and keep them running.</p>\n<p>This is a membership group for people who understand that, and who realize that working in a group is the best way to afford this sort of hobby/art.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Membership and continued involvement in the group is dependent on several things.</p>\n<p>1) Artistic vision consistent with the concepts of this group art/erotic/fetish not explicit/adult.</p>\n<p>2) A friendly, cordial, and cooperative attitude with others and a professional respect for the models especially.</p>\n<p>3) Activity by attending/participating on a regular basis in the workshops, events, and shoots.</p>\n<p>4) A portfolio review.</p>\n<p>5) Payment of membership and workshop fees.</p>\n<p>6) You must be an active member of the http://meetup.com/models group and have attended several of the Fetish, art/figure and similar workshops.  This is our screening process.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Annual fee is $375 per year, and may be paid in 3 installments of $125 each, over 3 consecutive months.</p>\n<p>Your first payment is due upon acceptance into the group.</p>\n<p>If you understand these ideas, and agree, you may apply, or you can ask questions and be a part of the more ordinary group at http://meetup.com/models</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>MODELS:</strong> If you are a fetish model (FEMALE), and want to be a part of this group, please apply.  You pay for your membership here by working/modeling, and will even be able to make some money once your dues are paid.  The more involved you are, the more you will be able to earn, and the more props you'll have access to.  There are perks being a part of the group.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Are yinz guys interested in going green? Or do you just have a green thumb n'at?</p>\n<p>Are you trying to live better, eat locally, or do you want to help create a more sustainable Pittsburgh? Do you want to meet other people in the area that enjoy farmer's markets and learning about composting? Are you thinking about an organic lifestyle but feel overwhelmed by it all, and are just looking to ease into the whole thing? Well, me too!</p>\n<p><br>\n\nA few friends and myself have decided to take the steps to live greener, eat \"more-ganic\" and have fun while doing it! We also figured that there were others out there that were just as intimidated as us to make the switch to a healthier and more eco-friendly life- so we created this group.</p>\n<p>We are looking to meet a couple of times a month to talk about composting and buying locally as well as swapping recipes and just mingle. We are planning potlucks, nature walks, garden parties, trips to local farms, wineries and organic restaurants- as well as changing the image of GOING GREEN. We are not militant zealots that want to stop people from living, but people looking to live eco-friendly and socially responsible- with an emphasis on living in Pittsburgh (an urban society).</p>\n<p>We are a diverse group, looking to add more diversity- vegans as well as meat lovers are welcome. We encourage discussions on \"hot topics\" but THIS IS NOT A DEBATE GROUP- so PLEASE leave your judgements and preaching elsewhere- there is room for everyone! We encourage people to share their viewpoints and opinions, but are not looking to convert anyone, or promote any lifestyle over another.</p>\n<p>So whether you are looking to make a small change like trying out MEATLESS MONDAYS once a month, or going the whole way and selling your car and living in a tree, come on out and meet us!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Free to join, but donations fuel the events!&nbsp; Give if you are able!&nbsp; If not, help out in other ways - host an event, offer to carpool, and of course, goodies are always welcome!</p>",

Support is offered through our daily activities, as well as through our message boards. We currently have over 100 moms in our club. Some of our mothers work part time or during the school year, but the majority stay at home full time. Therefore, our activities are typically during the weekday. We offer at least one activity a day ranging from playgroups and park playtimes to lunch bunches, mocha mornings, and field trips. Our moms participate as much or as little as their schedule allows. On our message boards moms dialog about everything from how to get your child to give up their binky to what to do when your toilet explodes!</p>\n<p>Socialization for our members develops from our daytime activities with children and our evening activities with just moms. We offer a monthly Moms Night Out, as well as several activity groups including the following clubs: Book, Health &amp; Fitness, Knitting, Movie, Scrapbooking, and Wine. We also have occasional events for moms and their significant others, as well as family events like picnics.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Our mission of service is fulfilled by supporting our local community through service projects, monetary donations, and sponsorship in events. Service projects include things like making Halloween and Valentine crafts for senior citizens, a collection drive for the Pittsburgh Women's Shelter, and making cards for Veterans. We support organizations that help women and children, as well as causes that are important to our members. We also sponsor a team each year in Pittsburgh's March of Dimes Walk.</p>\n<p>The Mt. Lebanon Moms Network is a great way to meet people if you are new to the area, new to motherhood, or new to staying at home full time. We offer activities and support for mothers in and around the Mt. Lebanon, PA area (i.e. Upper St. Clair, Castle Shannon, Dormont, Scott Township, Carnegie, Bridgeville). We do not have any geographic restrictions, however, potential members should understand that the vast majority of our events are in the Mt. Lebanon area. If you are willing to travel to events in this area, you can join our group, regardless of where you live.</p>\n<p>We are not your typical Meetup group, but a registered non-profit organization that uses Meetup for their website. If you are interested in joining our group, please click Join Us! on our Meetup site. <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">You will then be prompted to create a Meetup profile that will be sent to our organizers.</span> Our Membership Director will be in touch with you within a week with details about how to join. <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">All potential members are required to attend one of our monthly business meetings or another public event that accommodates your schedule prior to being approved to join our group</span>. This is done to ensure the safety of our moms and our children. At this event you can find out more about our group and meet other members. If you decide to join, you will be asked to pay annual dues of $36 and complete a liability form. After this process you can join our Meetup website and get started participating in this growing and exciting group!</p>",

We'll get together and golf/socialize around the Pittsburgharea.</p>\n<p>We are part of The American Singles Golf Association (www.SinglesGolf.com/Pittsburgh) -a group of chapters throughout the United States and Canada composed of real people you meet face-to-face and, of course, play golf with. Chapters hold general membership meetings once each month and play golf as a group as often as they would like. Many social-only events are also held throughout the year.</p>\n<p>Meeting others through golf is probably the best way to begin any relationship, business or personal. It allows you the opportunity to see others in an environment where there's no loud music, smoke-filled rooms. And you get to see them at their best and not-so-best. But most importantly, we're all about having FUN! There's nothing like a group of 32 friends getting together on a Saturday afternoon for a great round of golf followed by dinner at a local restaurant. It's just a great way to spend your time.</p>\n<p>Now is the perfect time to join our singles golf group, as the golf courses are waiting!</p>\n<p>Meet new single friends who golf!</p>",

Two of these are mental drives which for many thousands of years were essential to survival, but tend to get us modern humans into trouble — the PIG, the ever-present drive to Pursue Instant Gratification; and the APE, the drive to Avoid Painful Experience. In earlier times, these drives served our ancestors well in feeding and protecting themselves. But today they operate mainly within the mind, where they serve to feed and protect the Ego, the false mind-created identity whose constant demands lead us astray.</p>\n<p>— Krishna Pendyala</p>",

The Center offers the study and meditation programs of Kadampa Buddhism, under the guidance of our Resident Teacher, Erica Richardson.</p>\n<p>Kalpa Bhadra Kadampa Buddhist Center, was founded on the knowledge that it is possible for everyone to cultivate positive states of mind that will lead to calmness and inner peace. We strive to provide a conducive environment for people in Pennsylvania to deepen their understanding and experience of meditation practice and Buddhist studies.

In addition to these (can't beat the price!), we'll post \"almost free\" ones where the cost is low <span>(at most $5)</span> compared to the fun that can be had.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We're always looking for more ideas. <span>YOU CAN POST YOUR OWN EVENTS HERE.</span> If you have one, <span>please click \"+Schedule a New Meetup\"</span> and we will add it to our calendar as a \"suggestion\" ... and let me know so that I can turn it into a Meetup event.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This group is both informative (Just giving us CHEAPSKATES a heads up about events!) about Free and Cheap events (aka almost free) and also about real social meetup events that go on.</span> So far the ratio to events where you do stuff with other meetup people and the informative\\informational events about cool free and cheap events is about 15% Social Events/85% Informational.&nbsp; <br></strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>It's up to YOU to make your own fun!&nbsp; And if you suggest an event PLEASE TRY TO TURN IT INTO A EVENT that people can meet up an interact.&nbsp; <br></span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an VERY ACTIVE MEETUP, you will get a ton of e-mail, my recommendation is if you have a secondary e-mail address use that for your user id.&nbsp; Or that you go up to \"My Profile\" on right hand side of page and select E-mail and Notifications.&nbsp; You still will get a bunch of e-mails but it will be more manageable. Meetups WORK because of E-mail, not because people come here to look for things to do.<span><br></span></span></strong><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span>FYI: Social events at places can be posted as long as it is FREE to go there or the cover is $5 or less.</span> People can decide on their own if they are eating and drinking. Example: Lets go see this Band that has no cover charge at this Bar. If YOU want to eat or drink something while you're there that's on YOU.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's still a FREE or ALMOST FREE event. If they charged more than $5 for cover or had a mandatory food n drink min above $5 then it won't get posted. Or a YOGA class that asks for a $5 donation is okay, $6 is not...</span> <br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span><span>This was preventing some social events from happening on this page</span> and we want to encourage social\\fun events on the free and almost free group.</span></span></span></strong></p>\n<p><span><strong>2nd FYI: NO Multi-level marketers or marketing in any way shape or form! This will lead to banning.</strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

YES CROSS-POSTING IS ALLOWED AND RECOMMENDED!</strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Events will be all over PA region and there will be no restrictions on what can be posted.   <span style=\"color : #000000\">This site is for everybody and is INCLUSIVE not EXCLUSIVE and it's okay to cross-post.</span></strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>We will do a variety of activities to include dinners, movies, parties, comedy clubs, sporting events, concerts, happy hours, and whatever else people want to do.</strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong><span style=\"color : #000000\">This is a drama free group.</span> meaning if you don't want to come to an event, just say no, and <span style=\"color : #000000\">if you RSVP please have the respect to change the RSVP if you can not make it.</span></strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>RULES FOR SETTING UP EVENTS:</strong></span><br>\n\n <span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>1.  If you plan an event YOU NEED TO BE THERE! (even if you are the musician singing or comedian telling the jokes, don't post events for others, this KEEPS IT REAL!)</strong></span><br>\n\n <span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>2.  Make the Event FUN/Interesting/Cool!   And give details on where, how you will meet and interact!</strong></span><br>\n\n <span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>3.  We are all adults!  No Drama! Have fun!  Be cool and respectful to others!</strong></span><br>\n\n <span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>4.  No cold calling/e-mailing people, except to ask questions about the event. Don't cold e-mail people can be creepy and not respectful.</strong></span><br>\n\n <span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>5.  NO MULTILEVEL MARKETING OR ADVERTISING!  If you post an event you have to be there, and you don't have to babysit people but you do have TO KEEP IT REAL!  (example, I am Vending at JAM ON WALNUT, I create the event JAM ON WALNUT, mention the Bands, how it's fun and cool the event is and to say hi or wave to me).</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color : #000000\">ARTIST's of ANY TYPE POSTING YOUR OWN EVENT:</span> <span style=\"color : #222222\">PLEASE try to find a way to meet and interact with the people that show up!  here are some examples:Meet before or After the Show, have a special table for the Pittsburgh Social Club people if you get a decent amount of RSVP's etc.  it will help you gain some fans that will show up again to your shows!</span><br>\n\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Most of the Events like Happy Hours, Bar Crawls, Dinners this won't be an issue, keeping it real happens naturally.   People at meetups WANT social interaction even if it's just saying hi after a show.</strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>We're trying to get a critical mass of members so to have enough people to keep things interesting. Meetups live and die on how many events are on their calendar and the GOAL to be Self Sustaining:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color : #000000\">OUR GOAL:</span> 1000 Facebook Members &amp; about 3000 on the Meetup Pittsburgh Social Club</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(the Pittsburgh Social Club meetup is more important, because Facebook is more of a Pay to Play venue, Meetup has a better Calendaring System, and the automated email reminders help get people to show up).</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>We are trying to keep things social, fun and AWESOME!</strong></span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>Hope to see you at an EVENT!  OR POST ONE!</strong></span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Cheers</strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>Frank Halling</strong></span><br>\n\n <span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>Head Dis-organizer</strong></span><br>\n\n <span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>Pittsburgh Social Club</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>PS. This is an VERY ACTIVE MEETUP! you will get a ton of e-mail, my recommendation is if you have a secondary e-mail address use that for your user id.  Or that you go up to \"My Profile\" on right hand side of page and select E-mail and Notifications.  You still will get a bunch of e-mails but it will be more manageable. Meetups WORK because of E-mail, not because people come here to look for things to do.</strong></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

Scottish country dance is sometimes called \"the ballroom dancing of Scotland\" -- it's a social dance form in which square dancing and contra dancing have their origins. It is also a great form of exercise and aerobic activity. It is practiced world-wide -- learn to dance here in Pittsburgh and you can attend social dance events the world over! Come for a fun-filled evening of social dance. You don't need a partner. You don't need any particular attire (although comfortable soft-soled shoes are a plus). You don't need to be Scottish. Beginners are always welcome! Our classes meet Mondays and Saturdays, except during the summer. We begin at 7 PM with instruction on the basic steps and figures for beginning dancers.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Ciao a tutti! This group is for seekers who are looking to enhance their spiritual lives with discussions and information drawn from ancient and modern Paganism on the Italian Peninsula. This is a place for sharing (rituals, recipes, spells, prayers, family traditions, art work, inspirational stories …), asking questions, and discussing issues. This group is also a way for Pagan Italo-philes to meet and build community. I ask only that the focus of the conversation be Italy. There are other groups dedicated to Wicca, Witchcraft, and Paganism. Above all things this is a place to show love and respect for others ... other paths, people, and perspectives. As Italy's history is one of cultural diversity, there was never one right way to anything. Keeping that in mind, we need to recognize the diversity of those who share our love of Italy and its Pagan past. So if Nonna used to have saints on her altar, it is fine to talk about that here. One needs to remember that one way Pagan traditions survived was by disguising it as Catholicism. It is a legitimate part of our Italian heritage. I know this was the case for my family… I will be posting links to other groups, websites, articles on Stregheria, Stregoneria, Traditional Italian Witchcraft, ancient mythology (Etruscan, Greek, Roman, and Lombard), Folk Traditions of Italian-American immigrants, Paganism as it exists today in modern Italy. Some of the links will be in English and others in Italian (I will write a quick translation in English). I will be posting summaries of books I have read on Witchcraft. These will cover books written in Italian and in English. For books that are available here, in the USA, I encourage discussions based on these books or any others that you might be reading. The point of this group is to keep the conversation focused on Italian Paganism, as practiced there and as practiced abroad by those who are drawn to its rich history. This is a place to forge new friendships and stretch the mind a bit ... both good things! Simply put ... anger and harmful words will not be tolerated. Note: After we gain members, we will probably have a few events, so start thinking of some fun activities. This group is based in Pittsburgh, but that does not mean that all activities need to be in Allegheny County... I see little sub-groups forming in various places in W. PA and these can use this site as a way to communicate with news and events...</p>",

      "description": "<p>To men and women of all ages who love to travel, this group is for you! I started this group because I love to travel and make new friends and I know that there are many people like me who just don't have a lot of other folks with whom you can travel. This is YOUR travel group. If you have a time share, a camper or a summer/winter home, etc. and want to share it, great! Weekend trips, cruises, 1-2 week vacations, guided excursions, overseas travel are just some of the ideas I had in mind and I definitely want your suggestions, too. This is the group to take a trip to that place you've always wanted to go explore. We'll meet occasionally and discuss where we'd like to go and then hit the open road together. We'll make new friends, fun memories and more photo albums we can bore our friends with!!! What more could you want in a travel group? Well, just let me know and I'll do my best to make it happen for you!  Suggestions are welcome!</p>",

      "description": "<p>Strange Brew - a beer sharing and tasting group</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The purpose of this group is share craft beers that you might not normally have had a chance to try. We will each bring in a few brews and everyone will get samples until the bottles are empty. We don't want to bring standard beers that anyone can get everywhere. The idea is to bring in beers that are a little more unique: new releases, seasonal, special editions, one-offs, rare to Pittsburgh brews, home brews or even beers that you pick up out of the area... that sort of thing.  This isn't meant as an exchange group as we will be drinking the brews at the meetups.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There are basically two sides to what could be brought to the meetups. The first would be beers that you would be able to buy in the area but are a little uncommon. Those would be the seasonal, new releases, special releases, etc. It is possible that many people would not normally get a chance to try these brews either because they sell out or because people do not realize that these are available. Once we get a chance to try these beers we might be able to go out to find them and buy them for ourselves. This is nice because if you try something that you like, you can keep an eye out and get more.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The other side would be beers that we would not be able to buy in the area. Those would be home brews and beers brought in from out of the area. Home brews are obviously not available anywhere except at the brewer’s house. When I travel I like to stop in at bottleshops to see what they have available. I often find beers that I have never seen before and that I know are not available in Pittsburgh. This is nice because you would be able to try or share brews that we might never see again, a unique experience.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We will be able to try each brew and discuss what we like or do not like about it. People who know a lot about beer will be able to share insight that others might not know and help educate those new to craft beers. People who are just getting into craft beers will be able to taste different styles. They will be able to hear what other like minded folk think about each and compare that to their own opinions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Outside of not wanting commonly available brew brought in, we are NOT going to be a snob minded group. People of all levels of experience and all levels of taste are welcome. The only way to get the Pittsburgh beer scene to grow is to have new people learn about craft beers. The only way to learn about beer is to try a variety.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><strong>If you like it, drink it!</strong></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New Group Rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bring some unique, unusual or rare (for the area) beer for everyone to try.  Just 2 bottles of 12oz brews, or 1 of larger bottles.</li>\n<li>Have a good time.</li>\n<li>Repeat rules 1 and 2 at the next Strange Brew...</li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "<p><span>Encounter groups are people talking in a room for a couple of hours. There's a special trick: one person talks and the others listen. This just makes sure everybody hears what's said. There's no rule about interrupting; everybody will talk. You'd attend a group if you're interested in communication skills.</span></p>\n<p>Considering how many interactions there will be, I'm happy that I can't predict what'll happen. But I can list trends:</p>\n<p>1) In everyday life, people misunderstand&nbsp;<i>intention</i>&nbsp;more frequently than they do&nbsp;<i>literal words</i>. But inside the group, people have&nbsp;<i>time</i>&nbsp;(a couple of hours) to be and feel understood.&nbsp; <br></p>\n<p>2) Because participants are listening without distraction, your words land harder.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I hope those two trends encourage you to attend.</p>\n<p>Email me to indicate your interest. I'm always interested in spaces; email me if you have an idea for one.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Finally SLR cameras have come back in vogue again. If you have been using a point and shoot camera for years and decided to get yourself a SLR camera you may be confused by all the controls you suddenly have. Don't continue to use pre-programmed settings on your camera. Learn what the F-Stop, Shutter speed and ISO settings mean and learn how your photos can be much more creative than ever before.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I have been shooting for almost 30 years. I have shot studio, weddings, seniors, sports (including the Steelers and Pirates). My wife, friends, and neighbor kids come to me to help them understand how to use a SLR. I discovered many people have been upgrading to SLRs now that they are under $700 for excellent camera kits. So I thought I would see if others would be interested in learning about using there cameras to the fullest extent.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So if you are excited about your new camera but confused about its capabilities and want to just get out and have fun and learn a little, this group is for you. The groups meetings will stay small so you will get individual attention. I will try to mix up locations and types of shoots so that new things can always be learned.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>***** Important Information for New Members ******</p>\n<p>In order to really go into detail about how to use F-Stop, Shutter Speed, ISO, and White Balance and how to shoot in all manual mode I need to keep the group down to just four people.  This allows for plenty of questions and hands on assistance, any more and its difficult to give you the attention that you initially need.  Also, in order to attend lager group meet ups you will need to attend at least one of the Photo 101 meet up events.  The Photo 101 is about 2 hours.  The cost of Photo 101 is $50 (because of time and small group with individual attention).  Also the fee is required to be paid upon reservation via pay pal.  If you cancel 24 hours in advance I can transfer the payment to a future Photo 101 course.  After you attend Photo 101 you might be interested in Photo 102 which goes into greater depth about white balance, using a gray card and how to make basic fixes in Raw Convertor and Photoshop. Email me if you have questions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Terry</p>",

For more information check out the main group at http://meetup.com/models More information will be posted here soon.</p>\n<p>The purpose of founding this group was several fold.  The main reason was to give the more interested photographers and models a venue to work together making images that were harder to do on their own due to costs, props, whatever.  By pulling the \"fetish\" and \"Erotic\" into it's own group, it provided a better atmosphere for creativity as well.</p>\n<p>The second reason was we moved most of the the nude/figure/fetish/erotic out of the Pittsburgh Model and Photographer Meetup group, leaving that a basic people photography group, with a few \"nude\" events.</p>\n<p>The Original group is a more basic, intro to model photography and use of studio equipment.</p>\n<p>We hope this helps people find more of what they want, without the stuff they don't.</p>\n<p>We have been having 2-3 Figure/Art/Fetish events a month on a regular basis, and it's time to give this the attention it needs.   We have been doing some pretty advanced work, and there is a \"core\" of photographers who have gotten very involved.</p>\n<p>We also feel there is a need for basic \"people photography\" and studio techniques, so we will break this group off the original one.</p>\n<p>If you are in the Pittsburgh area, AND are serious about Nude/Figure photography, or want to learn, this is the group.  We don't just have \"one\" meetup. We have a lot of different things going on, and we have special events, impromptu shoots, and more.  The more you participate, the more you will find going on.  *NOT* everything gets listed to the calendar.</p>\n<p>1) Regular figure/art workshops</p>\n<p>2) Regular fetish workshops</p>\n<p>3) Special \"fetish\" and \"erotic\" workshops with traveling models</p>\n<p>Group Requirements:</p>\n<p>1) You MUST be in the Pittsburgh area,<br>\n\n2) You MUST be a photographer or model with some experience<br>\n\n3) You MUST be a member of the http://meetup.com/models group<br>\n\n4) You MUST participate, or you will be removed.</p>\n<p> </p>",

Our group organizes or promotes activities that include weekly conversation meetups, French-language movie showings, French-language dinners, <span>cooking lessons in French,</span> outings to hear opera or symphonic music of France, trips to the theater for English-language plays written by French authors, museum visits, French Scrabble game nights, and talks by experts on subjects related to the French-speaking world.</p>\n<p>The goal is to promote the french culture in the wide sense (language, culture etc.) so that everybody is welcome to join. If you attend an old French-class long time ago and want to try to speak French again or just listen the language, you're welcome. If you do not speak French but would like to learn about the French wines and its cultures, that is perfects and you are welcome to join our wine tasting events ! The more we are, the best !</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To join our group, we do ask for a few basics:</p>\n<p>1) Please upload a profile picture so that we can recognize you. Our organizers can sometimes find you quicker than you can find them at crowded events. Walking up to strangers and asking if they are there for a meetup can yield some funny looks.</p>\n<p><br>\n\n 2) Please answer the profile questions so everyone can learn about the other members of our wonderful group.</p>\n<p><br>\n\n 3) We do everything possible to foster an open, encouraging and inclusive French language environment. <span>Ideally, participants will have at least a rudimentary ability and desire to learn to speak this beautiful language. It is expected that French is used exclusively at certain events: weekly French conversation</span> meetups. Beginners are always welcome also ! Of course, this is not mandatory and English people can join. However, this is better to speak english in cultural event (wine tasting, movies, etc.)</p>\n<p><br>\n\n 4) Our group is as good as its members and the activities it sponsors. If you hear of a French-related event in Pittsburgh or have an idea for an activity, please let one of the organizers know. We welcome interest in helping to organize/host events.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>7) Out of respect to our organizers as well as the members attending a meetup, we do ask that you change your RSVP if you have to back out of an event.  It is ideal if you can update 24 hours ahead, but if not, please contact the organizer (most will give their cell phone number to attendees, in case of changes).  IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO POST A \"NO\" FOR EVENT ATTENDANCE, unless it is to show a change of plans.</p>",

This group is sponsored by <strong>ABOARD’s Autism Connection of PA</strong>. You can visit their web site at: <strong><a href=\"http://autism-support.org/\">http://autism-support.org</a></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #0000ff ; font-size : large\"><strong>About This Support Group:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">This support group is run and facilitated by two adults on the autism spectrum.  This group is an extension of the consulting work and speaking engagements that we do for support organizations, schools, and hospitals, building on our successful lecture series, <strong>Autism From The Inside Out</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">The aim of this support group is to help parents, family members, educators, therapists, and other care providers gain a better understanding of the experience of autism, and to connect families and professionals with resources and support.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">It is our experience that there are many misconceptions about autism that make education and employment more difficult for people on the spectrum.  We will be available to answer any questions you may have about spectrum disorders with a goal of improving the lives of all members of the autism community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">This group will meet on the third Sunday of each month at the <strong>Community Human Services (CHS)</strong> building located at <strong>372 Lawn Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213</strong>.  There will be a topic announced for each Meetup that may be provided by the facilitators, or suggested by group members in the previous meeting.  If there is interest, after the Meetup, members are invited to gather at a local restaurant to continue their conversations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #0000ff\"><strong><span style=\"font-size : large\">Other ABOARD Support Groups in Pittsburgh:</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">In addition to this support group for families and care providers for people with autism, ABOARD’s Autism Connection of PA also sponsors three social groups for people on the spectrum</span>.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #3366ff\"><strong><span style=\"font-size : medium\">The Discussion Group:</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">The Discussion Group is a social group for adults on the autism spectrum who want to have friendly and supportive conversations with other adults on the spectrum. It is not a therapy group or a support group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">The Discussion Group is run and facilitated by Rebecca Klaw. It is sometimes led by co-facilitators, April Artz, Amy Matz, or Caitlin Freeman. Occasionally, the group features speakers who provide information that is useful to people on the spectrum and their families.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">The Discussion Group meets at the Carnegie Library in Squirrel Hill twice per month, on the second and fourth Sundays of the month.  After every meeting, group members are invited to gather at local restaurants to continue their conversation and socialization.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">To join the Discussion Group Meetup, go to:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color : #000000\"><a href=\"http://www.autism-support-group.com/\">http://www.autism-support-group.com</a></span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #3366ff\"><strong><span style=\"font-size : medium\">The Social Outings Group:</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">The Social Outings Group is for adults on the autism spectrum who want to participate in social events in a friendly and supportive environment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">These events often include potlucks, visits to local museums, trips to Kennywood, and sponsored walks. The Social Outings Group usually schedules one social outing per month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">The Social Outings Group is facilitated by Heather Conroy and Janice Nathan. Group members are encouraged to suggest social outings that they would like to participate in for future events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">The Social Outings Meetup uses the same web site as the Discussion Group.

We'll be discussing various strategies including landlording, rehabbing, wholesaling, sub2's, land contracts, lease/options, owner financing, multi-units, foreclosures, short sales, hard money &amp; private money, etc etc. We welcome all levels of experience from the brand new investor to the seasoned veteran.</p>\n<p>Although you can be somewhat successful if you \"go it alone\", your investing success will easily grow 10-fold if you're connected with a great team of like-minded people (What Napoleon Hill called a Mastermind alliance). By joining this group you'll have the opportunity to expand your network/team, and have a chance to voice whatever questions you may have. You may be one idea or one strategy away from having your investing go to the next level, which is why continuing to educate yourself, networking, and keeping an open mind is so important. As the saying goes: \"Five years from now you'll be the same person you are today except for the books you read and the people you meet.\"</p>\n<p>At our montly meetups, which will be relaxed yet informative, you'll meet new people who will help to create a positive change in your life and business.

I'm relatively new to the craft world, but I find it very exciting and a lot of fun to do. While I, myself am located in the Brookline area, I am looking for some crafters, artists, crocheters, and creative individuals from anywhere in Pittbsburgh looking to create, share, and combine ideas! We can meet in public places (coffee shops, libraries, etc.) or if things really get rolling as we get comfortable with each other, also at each other's homes. This is meant to be a free-for-all, anything goes group where we can share our ideas and possibly have a different focus/theme for each meeting. Interested? Please join and send in your ideas! :)</p>",

Share in insightful discussions and experience enlightening guided meditations accompanied by the sacred sound healing of the magnifident crystal singing bowls. When you experience this powerful form of sound healing, not only do you experience this by hearing with your ears, but your entire being experiences the sensation of being bathed in vibrational tones of healing light and sound. The beautiful sound and vibration of the bowls lift you into a new dimension of awareness within your own consciousness. We open each gathering with sacred drumming and end (weather permitting) with a fire ceremony at the medicine wheel outdoors. Anyone is welcome in Love and Light.</p>",

      "description": "<p>So you want to live the good life...<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Do you have a life philosophy to help guide you? Sounds too difficult? It is more simple than you would  imagine. It is all about letting of what really does not matter...<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Stoic philosophy, one of the most popular and successful schools of thought in ancient Rome proves to be remarkably applicable to modern lives. Using the psychological insights and the practical techniques of the Stoics, one can avoid the feelings of chronic dissatisfaction that plague so many of us. Stoic techniques for attaining tranquility will be presented along with how to put these techniques to work in our own life. You will learn how to minimize worry, how to let go of the past and focus our efforts on the things we can control. Stoic philosophers show us how to become thoughtful observers of their own life in a way that parallels the mindfulness techniques of Buddhism. This is an western path to reduce suffering, live a virtuous life (in the Roman sense) and attain a truly joyful life.</p>\n<p>I will use William Irvine's <em>A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy</em> as a starting point for conversation because it is so accessible to newcomers to Stoicism. We will then read other texts (ancient and modern) to build on this modern guide and introduction. Many of these texts can be found online at no cost to you. I will present a short lecture at the beginning of each meeting based on recent readings I have been doing. This mini-lecture is meant to stimulate conversation and active participation by attendees.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n There is a sister group on Facebook called Pittsburgh Stoics Group https://www.facebook.com/groups/127844464042850/</p>\n<p>On the Facebook page I will post links, articles, and book recommendations on Stoicism and other ancient philosophies that can be applied to modern living.  I hope that we can also have some insightful discussions there as well. I will post notices for our events on both webpages.</p>",

Life is more that just work, and house hold chores. This group is to get a team of women to plan fun events, talk and remember what it was like before kids and how we had fun!!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I would like to visit old Mansion's in the Tri state area, maybe some historic places, specialty shops, fairs, museums, bike rides or walks and maybe even snowmobiling if possible.  If you like flowers we could go to Phipps or maybe the zoo, or other animal parks. Car cruise, bring your car or just come to look or dinner at a rustic lodge or visit Black Water Falls, WV. These are all things I have been wanting to do and would like some friends to join me. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> I also would like to go to the Allegheny Observatory to look at the stars and maybe a road trip to the Amish Country or Hershey, or vineyard tour.</p>\n<p>Those are just some of my ideas, this will be our group open for all suggestions and fun for everyone!!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This is a very <strong>FRIENDLY</strong> group, there are no fee's, no requirements, and few penalties.  This group is not run like a business, but as a way to make new friends and have fun without DRAMA!  If any other meet up group would like to join us at events that great too! I am NOT a competitive person, and get along with everyone so if you are looking for a relaxing time, this is the group.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I am open to all ideas and have polls for you to give your opinion there are only good ideas, and I don't have a problem if other groups do the same things or similar to us.  I feel you should always be open to learning and growing, and what better way than through others experience.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Life has enough ups and downs, I started this group to have something to look forward to and to make some long lasting friendships.  So join me and lets start making fun memories. Life is too short.  Live every day like its your last, and always leave your friends and family with a smile :)</p>\n<p>                                     </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>                                        <strong><span style=\"color : #ad364c ; font-size : medium\">WELCOME LADIES</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color : #ad364c ; font-size : medium\"><img src=\"http://us.cdn4.123rf.com/168nwm/konstanttin/konstanttin1203/konstanttin120300030/12782470-flying-bird-sparrow-isolated-on-white-background.jpg\" alt=\"Little_bird : flying bird sparrow isolated on white background\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px\"></span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color : #ad364c ; font-size : medium\"> </span></strong></p>\n<p>                                          </p>",

      "description": "<p>This group is aimed at anyone in their 20's and 30's who wants to meet new people! We have so much variety in this area when it comes to enjoying the outdoors - hiking and biking trails, kayaking, rock climbing, geocaching, you name it! While this group is open to any kind of event, I'd love to meet other outdoors enthusiasts to enjoy the Laurel Highlands and surrounding areas! I know there are similar groups out there, but I'm aiming this meetup at a younger age group because I know how hard it is to meet people after college! So if you're looking for something to do, please join up, host an event, come along on a hike, and meet some new people!</p>",

Receiving support from our peers is an evidence-based strategy to build the life of our choosing. Peers who have lived through similar experiences can provide us with hope in a way that others cannot because they've actually gone through difficulties and seen life get better, as opposed to professionals who have studied that experience in books and classrooms.</p>\n<p>These support groups will be facilitated by peers, not professional therapists, and should not replace, but complement other therapies.</p>\n<p>I am very interested in hosting additional support groups with different focuses (ex. general support group, anxiety support group, WRAP group, overeaters anonymous, etc.) in different areas of Pittsburgh, or on different days/times, but I am too busy to commit to facilitating more groups myself right now. If anyone is interested in facilitating a support group, I'd be happy to support you in many ways.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to contact me through Meetup or at DBTskillsPGH@gmail.com with any questions. We look forward to meeting you and supporting each other!</p>\n<p>Thank you all,</p>\n<p>Jess Hirsh</p>",

This forum is for “Users” that apply Revit in their BIM Process. Our focus is on the technical aspects in model building but not limited to. Those who use the software are encouraged to participate at our meetings sharing experiences, tips &amp; tricks, and open discussions. Our meetings are to increase the knowledge of the software but also anything that relates to the connectivity with Revit or the BIM Process. SCRUG is not a forum for advertising. The sharing of knowledge is welcome from Owners, Contractors, End-Users, and Technical Reps. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n Meetings are held on the 3rd Thursday of the Month. Locations may vary and will be both posted on Linked-In and emailed. To get on the mailing list, please contact Jeremy Schmidt, Rich Crawford, or Jeff Light:<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Robert Duffy - robert.duffy@mbakercorp.com<br>\n\n Jeremy Schmidt - jschmidt@allenshariff.com<br>\n\n Rich Crawford - rich@ae-works.com</p>\n<p>Jeff Light - jlight@mcfarchitects.com</p>",

There will be a little bit for everyone---whether it's meeting up at a happy hour, going to a baseball game, or visiting a museum. We will visit monthly at a coffee shop, which is a low-key way to meet new members. This isn't a networking group; it is a place for women to find other like-minded women to go do fun things. Occasionally, we will have couple nights, where you can bring along your significant other.</p>\n<p><strong>Suggestions for future events are welcomed! Everyone can host their own event, which helps create a group that has a little something for everyone.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align : center\"><span style=\"font-size : x-small\"><em>**You will be required to pay an annual $5 membership dues*</em></span></p>",

This group is for positive men and women who are single/not partnered and raising kids. Let's get together for fun activities both for when you have your children and for when you do not. Let's go to movies, bars, restaurants, traveling, hiking and other adventures (without our kids) and to amusement parks, outdoor parks, museums and other kid-friendly venues (with our kids)! There is life after divorce or a break-up!! Members of this group are upbeat and want to live a full, social, balanced life.</p>\n<p>We ask for a modest annual dues donation to help offset costs to run the meetup.  Jim pays $19/month to meetup.com so that the group can be run from here.</p>\n<p>Don't be shy! Feel free to email or call any of the organizers prior to an event.  Don't feel like you have to come to any event with a friend.  Pretty much all of us didn't know one another at one time and had to make fast friends.  :)</p>\n<p>ONCE YOU HAVE A ATTENDED A MEETUP, JOIN OUR SECRET FACEBOOK GROUP.  Because  we made it secret (to protect our kids), you have to be emailed an invitation.  Email a leadership team person and provide him or her with your email.</p>",

I started the group after reading that more and more folks out there do not believe the science and data that clearly shows that climate change is real and accelerated by the burning of fossil fuels. It occurred to me that we all have a personal journey toward acceptance of our changing world and WE CAN make a difference. Please join me in being a \"changemaker.\" We'll get outside in beautiful environment while we discuss ways to reduce our personal carbon footprint. We will develop Green Teams who take community action in breaking through climate denial, finding ways to mitigate and adapt to our changing environment, and spread the word through outreach and education.  Please join and become an active member of this group. It will be fun and a great way to brainstorm and act on a real and important global issue.</span></p>",

      "description": "<p><span style=\"font-size : small\"><strong>Biophilia: Pittsburgh is the pilot chapter for a global Biophilia Network of creative minds dedicated to strengthening the bond between people and the natural world through education, discussion and action.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : small\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/BiophiliaPittsburgh/pages/Past_Presentations/\">Click here</a></strong> to access materials from our past meetings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : small\"><strong>Our Goals<br>\n\n</strong></span> <span style=\"font-size : small\">• To welcome and inspire others with the concept and principles of biophilia<br>\n\n</span> <span style=\"font-size : small\">• To foster collaboration and learning between professionals from a wide variety of disciplines<br>\n\n</span> <span style=\"font-size : small\">• To communicate biophilic principles in action-oriented ways to a wider audience for exponential and regional impact</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : small\"><strong>What Is Biophilia?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : small\">The term “biophilia,” which literally means “love of life,” was coined by social psychologist Erich Fromm and popularized by biologist E.O. Wilson, who defined it as “the innately emotional affiliation of human beings to other living organisms.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : small\">The implications of biophilia extend across a vast array of disciplines including design and engineering, nutrition, psychology, public health, education, biology and the humanities. Biophilia is expressed all over the world every day, through complex collaborations such as the design and construction of buildings and landscapes; and intimate, personal encounters including nature hikes and home gardening.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : small\"><strong style=\"font-size : small\">What Will We Do?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : small\">It all starts with good conversation! Biophilia: Pittsburgh will begin by meeting monthly at the <strong><a href=\"http://phipps.conservatory.org/project-green-heart/green-heart-at-phipps/center-for-sustainable-landscapes.aspx\">Center for Sustainable Landscapes</a></strong> classroom at <strong><a href=\"http://phipps.conservatory.org/\">Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens</a></strong>. Over delicious small-plates and light refreshments, a discipline or behavior will be identified — often by an expert guest speaker — and discussed among the participants in the interest of sharing ideas and identifying opportunities. With your direction, we hope to expand the schedule to include off-site trips to biophilic regional destinations like nature preserves, green buildings, and urban gardens, and to plan and enact initiatives in our own community to make things better for people and the planet. Join the movement!</span></p>",

What is unique about this group is the format we use to explore this topic. This is not a discussion group. For periods of about twenty minutes per participant the group members will ask questions of one participant. These questions are used to express Genuine Interest in the person in order to help them on their path of self inquiry. This is not a therapy group. There is a rotating group leader and it is their task to ask to assure that no question is leading or having an agenda of any kind. No one is trying to solve problems for anyone else. We attend the group to support each other’s self inquiry. For many people this format is challenging and takes several meetings to learn, but it is a format that we have found to be successful and useful over the course of many years. If you are genuinely interested in the topic of Philosophical Self Inquiry, with an ultimate goal of self enlightenment please join us.</p>",

We aim to do this by creating a website with all the essentials needed (one-stop political empowerment!) at PTTN.ORG. The other key is a chain reaction of support to come up to speed politically. Everyone has friends and acquaintances, and if you can recruit 2-3 of them and support them to come up to speed politically, and then support others, the chain reaction can spread around the country. It will lead to better use of tax money, lower taxes, a higher quality of life and increased long-term security for all of us!</p>",

      "description": "<p>Did you know that research shows that women are collectively less happy than we were 40 years ago? That is what Valorie Burton wrote in her book, \"Happy Women Live Better.\" This group is for women who want to work together to commit, build, and support one another to maintain happiness and balance in their lives. We will read and use Valorie's book as a guide to discuss our \"13 Happiness Triggers\". As we discuss them. we will put some of our \"Happiness Triggers\" into action by doing activities together that can help us to learn that happiness is not a given, it is doing .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our Meet Up's will be once a month, there is a $6.00 monthly fee to join, and a small fee for our monthly room rental typically no more than $3.00 . Keep in mind our activities take us all over the city, not just the South Hills area which is where our meet up is based for the meetings. &nbsp;There is something for every women even if she does not live in the South Hills. &nbsp;We will meet for coffee, lunch, or dinner, go to theater, attend special . &nbsp;events, talks, or lectures, go on hikes (with or without your dog) and even catch a movie; &nbsp;and even do volunteer work as a group, &nbsp;whatever time allows to maintain and support each other for that \"happy balance\" or just have fun, our meet is for serious minded women who want her happiness to be the focal point of her life. This meet is not for everyone, it is for like minded authentic women, who strive for \"doing\" and \"being.\" &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Does this sound like a good journey for you? Than join us for a wonderful trip to a great sisterhood of women for your evolving happiness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p><span><strong>Please keep in mind that this Meet-up is not a \"networking\" group or a place or \"opportunity to market a/your business\". This meet-up was organized solely &nbsp;for support, encouragement and empowerment.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Here are the Guidelines:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>-There is a $6.00 per month membership fee, even if you do not participate in an activity. This is to cover our monthly meet-up fee. Instructions for payment will follow after joining. &nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>-No soliciting or marketing of products or services permitted at our meets. &nbsp;This meet is for empowerment and support for the women in our group only. We will always stay on the topics listed in Valorie’s book. &nbsp;Whoever sends out endorsement e-mails to the group or comes to a meet selling or endorsing a product will be banned immediately.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>-Let me know if you would like to post an activity to the board, I can do it for you. Send request via e-mail pawzpetsitting2001@yahoo.com . &nbsp;I am hard to reach during the day, as I am out on the road all day. &nbsp;However if it is important and you need to talk, please let me know on the message what it is you need to talk and make it semi-detailed so we can make the time to talk. &nbsp;Please do not leave a message with any detail.&nbsp; <br> <br>-Please arrive at the meetings at least 10 minutes early, if you will be late, please text or call me @ (412) 758-7105. We will begin the meetings on time. &nbsp;We will spend the first 20 minutes doing introductions and warming up for our topic. The remainder of the time will be led by the facilitator of that meeting for our Happiness Trigger discussion.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>-This meet-up is located in the South Hills of Pittsburgh, however we do activities that take place all over the the Pittsburgh Area. Should &nbsp;you decide to participate in those activities outside the south hills you will need to feel comfortable driving to other areas of Pittsburgh should you decide to participate, yes, south hills folks you have to cross a bridge . &nbsp;Some of our members like to car pool to activities</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>-If you RSVP you need to show up, our core group is getting larger and space is limited to 14 women, so do so early. Give others a chance of coming if you are not sure you are coming. This is a commitment, so if 3 no shows without notice in a given year, I will need to rethink your membership. &nbsp; <br>There is a mandatory 5 &nbsp;meeting attendance per year, Again, this is a commitment if you sign up, you come, if not, give someone else a chance. I clean house every quarter asking members if they are still interested, if not, it is OK to resign, I understand life constantly changes.&nbsp; <br> <br>-Please let the facilitator guide the meeting and topic that is her job. &nbsp;When you are sharing, be aware of the time you’re speaking, keep to topic, be articulate, and please do not interrupt while someone else is speaking. &nbsp;Please do not feel you have to raise your hand, this is not a classroom, and it is a conversation, just chime in. &nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong> <br>and finally...I receive lots of requests to have meetings closer to the place of a member’s residence, I am fine with that, however, you will need to facilitate in doing so. &nbsp;Otherwise our Meet-up meets will always be in Mt. Lebanon at the Municipal Building the Third Sunday of each month starting in April, 2015. &nbsp; <br>Please understand that this meet is a group effort, although I founded it, it takes a team to make it work and I can’t do it myself. Your help is very much noticed and appreciated.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Thank you, and hope to meet you soon.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Happy &nbsp;Facilitator</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Colleen Amos_Mezinze <br> <br></strong></span></p>",

The Course is a kind of gentle \"spiritual psychotherapy\" whereby a person's thoughts can shift from fear to love. And according to ACIM, this shift is nothing short of a \"miracle.\" Miracles happened all the time, everyday. You need but ask. Come join us every other Saturday morning for readings from the text, lively discussion with like-minded seekers, alongside coffee and refreshments. And start experiencing miracles of your own. See how you can transform your life. This study group intended for all levels of interest, from beginning curiosity to seasoned students. Meetings occur on the 2nd and 4th Saturdays of the month. Group leader has been applying principles of the Course to her own life for over 20 years now...</p>",

Modern science suggests that all things are possible in the sub-atomic realm, where quantum particles form molecules that create your body and your brain, and link to your soul. Our meetings will explore the limitless possibilities that already lie within you. Structured like a university discussion group, topics will focus on personal and spiritual growth, working towards a PhD for your soul. We will study, explore and discuss a variety of spiritual and scientific works such as The Secret, What the Bleep Do We Know?!, A Course of Miracles, Leap!, The Divine Matrix, The Power of Now, etc. We will also link together a variety of different spiritual philosophies such as Buddhism, Taoism, Hinduism, Gnosticism, Christianity and the Kabbalah, all while using quantum physics to scientifically support their wisdom.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Growing krunchy kidz is a natural moms group, if our title didn't give it away! Growing krunchy kidz is a group of Mommas and their children that&nbsp;spend time with one another, supporting a natural lifestyle, growing and learning from each-other. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>A BIT MORE OF WHAT WE ARE ABOUT....</b></p>\n<p>Our Mommas have their own definition of \"krunchy\" and what works best for their family....everyone has their own passion and not everyone is the same (this is what makes our group open, honest, and unique). Some examples of \"krunchy\" are; focusing on attachment parenting, organics, holistic medicine, the environment, gardening, homeschooling, green living, etc...</p>\n<p>We'd love to know more about you and what your \"krunchy\" is! We empower one another by sharing our daily experiences and sharing our knowledge!</p>\n<p><b>WHERE DO WE MEET?&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p>Growing krunchy kidz meets <b>ALL OVER</b> Pittsburgh and <b>ALL OVER</b> surrounding areas. I cannot stress those two points enough! We have no boundaries and this is what makes us, us! This area provides many opportunities that go beyond your own neighborhood and we take advantage of all possible venues.</p>\n<p>We have Mommas from North, South, East, West, and central of Pittsburgh. You have to have transportation and be comfortable with a little bit of travel time some of the time for our group.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span><b>WHAT WE DO?</b></span> <br> </p>\n<p>We offer a wide variety of venues and activities for <b>all</b> ages of krunchy kidz ALL YEAR AROUND! At this time most all of our meetups occur during the weekdays/daytime. Our calendar is put together by members of our group. Our calendar typically offers at least one meetup a week.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some examples of meetups are; home play/potlucks, exploring &nbsp;new parks, hikes, &nbsp;spray parks, festivals, farm visits, museums, and whatever else you can think up!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We like to pack up, head out, and enjoy the entire day :)</p>\n<p><b>How can you be apart of our krunchy group of Mommas?</b> <br> </p>\n<p>Here's the scoop!</p>\n<p>If you are interested in our group, that's great! You will hear from one of the Organizers &nbsp;giving you the specifics of the next scheduled meetups.&nbsp;You will not have access to our site/members/calendar schedule until we have met you at a public meetup and approved you as a member. &nbsp;***<b>We ask that you attend 1 meetup with the first month of requesting membership</b>.*** We feel this is more than feasible with the frequency and variety of meetups we offer. &nbsp;This allows for all of us to meet one another in a public setting and to see that it is the right fit, as well as display your overall interest. If this time passes we will deny your request &nbsp;and ask that you come back when you have more time and there is more of an interest. &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>***note that I have found out that some response emails have gone to spam, so please check your email. You will get a response with in a week of your request.****</i></p>\n<p>At this time our group of Mommas are very active members, &nbsp;and to be honest, this is the type of Momma we are looking for. This does not mean you and your child(ren) have to attend every scheduled event, but it does mean that we are seeking out Mommas and Children that want to be involved.&nbsp;We take growing krunchy kidz seriously and would like you to do the same! We want to implement stable relationships for ourselves as well as our children.</p>\n<p><b>Membership Dues:</b></p>\n<p>growing krunchy kidz has a modest membership fee and we feel that your contribution is totally worth what all this group provides. It mostly covers Meetup costs, but any extra funds returns to the group in some way :) &nbsp;<b><i>Dues are currently 1/2 off (5$ in person, 6$ if paid online) and will start over January 2016</i></b></p>\n<p><i>Memership dues are non-refundable and the group has the right to discontinue membership at any time. Also, please note that all meetups attended you are responsible, as well as liable for your child and their safety. Being a member of the group means that you understand and agree to these terms.</i></p>",

The Natural Path, also known as Sahaj Marg, takes us on a journey in to the heart, towards the highest expression of our inner self. Meditation trains the mind to look within, to discover the Self. This is facilitated by an ancient yogic technique called pranahuti or transmission. Starting the day with meditation brings a different quality to the whole day.</p>\n<p><br>\n\n Sahaj Marg can best be known through practical, personal experience. We invite you to try it sincerely for a few months to test its efficacy in your own life.</p>\n<p><br>\n\n For more information:<br>\n\n <a class=\"linkified\" href=\"http://www.sahajmarg.org/seeker/practice\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.sahajmarg.org/seeker/practice</a><br>\n\n Ramkumar.Krishnan@yahoo.com</p>",

Each are mermaids at heart, and stand up paddlers in their spare time. The safety and comfort of our students is always our focus. We want your focus to be on yourself - as you allow the fluid movements of your experience to inspire, delight, and captivate your senses.  </p>\n<p>Interested in trying out SUP in a non-yoga atmosphere? No problem! Our Fun First Timers class is calling your name. Check out our website for more information: <a href=\"http://www.northeastpaddleboard.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.northeastpaddleboard.com/</a></p>\n<p>Quality of experience is always our #1 job. With glowing reviews on our Facebook page and being Pittsburgh's first SUP company, every paddler's experience is important to us. </p>\n<p>See you on the water...Namaste!</p>",

We have found that beyond ten the ability to critique and be critiqued decreases. Many of our participants have been published, and some have achieved awards for their work. We cover many genres, and have covered historical fiction, science fiction, YA fantasy, and autobiographical semi-fiction (mostly-true stories, but not written in the first person). We don't do poetry, and have zero experience with plays or screenplays. We currently have no one working on nonfiction, but we don't rule that out. Past members have done nonfiction and autobiographical family histories, for example. We are seeking to grow the group a bit. We meet every Monday at 6pm, and members are expected to make as many meetings as they can (if you only show up on the evening your work is being critiqued, it's not going to work out).</p>",

Technology is an ever-changing landscape and it seems nearly impossible to keep up with it all. It's so easy to stick with what you know, especially when you need to build quickly. And the day job isn't exactly the place to keep your personal sandbox. Well here's your excuse to finally try those exciting new technologies you keep reading about. Don't let your skills go to waste. Try New Tech. That's what this meetup is all about.</p>\n<p><span>The format? We'll have a 30-minute presentation on a specific topic, followed by a set of challenges set up by the organizers to get your hands dirty and really drive the point home. Yes, you'll need to bring a laptop. If you let us know ahead of time, we'll do our best to get you one.</span></p>\n<p><span>Interested in presenting? Send an email to <a>present@trynewtech.com</a>. Sometimes a little social pressure from a public commitment can be just the thing you need to pick up something new. We encourage you to take advantage of this meetup. The organizers will even help you create some engaging challenges.</span><br>\n\n</p>",

I train directly with the Lineage holder in China, Baohua Li Laoshi who may be moving to Pittsburgh himself soon! This art considers health/wellness &amp;amp; fighting to be two sides of the same coin. Through the circle walking practice we make the weakest parts of our bodies strong, while at the same time learning profound fighting skills. I look forward to meeting and training with you in this wonderful art.</p>",

The American Wine Society is all about the appreciation of wine through education and that is what this conference is all about. We are glad once more to serve the surrounding Pittsburgh area with what has become a Spring tradition for wine lovers and winemakers!\nThis year we are excited again to have national and internationally known members of the wine community offer seminars, tastings and a wealth of knowledge to enhance your appreciation of wine and winemaking.\nYou can hear from special presenters such as Ron and Rick Lanza from Wooden Valley Winery of California, who not only make wonderful wines but willingly help the amateur winemaker enhance their wine. Alex Sebastian of the Wooden Angel will be joined by Robert Mazza of Mazza Winery, along with winemaker Jeff Murphy of Johnson Estate Winery of New York. Acclaimed winemakers, Linda King and Dan Wolfe will join us along with new presenters, new educational tastings, vendors and of course it all ends with the Showcase of Wines, commercial winery walk-around tasting. All this for a great price.\nSo please register early so you won’t get shut out of the seminars you want to attend! We look forward to seeing you.\nFor complete details go to www.awspghwineconference.org ",

OWASP is an international organization and the OWASP Foundation supports OWASP efforts around the world. OWASP is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be trusted. All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most effective approaches to application security include improvements in all of these areas. We can be found at <a>www.owasp.org.</a> </p>\n<p><br>\n\n</p>\n<p>OWASP is a new kind of organization. Our freedom from commercial pressures allows us to provide unbiased, practical, cost-effective information about application security. OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company, although we support the informed use of commercial security technology. Similar to many open-source software projects, OWASP produces many types of materials in a collaborative, open way. The OWASP Foundation is a not-for-profit entity that ensures the project's long-term success.</p>\n<p><br>\n\n</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/e/6/600_337807142.jpeg\" style=\"margin : 5px ; max-width : 700px ; max-height : 700px\"></p>\n<p><br>\n\n</p>",

If you desire to be a Christian just like the ones in the Bible, this is what this group will be focused on.

If you can't make any of these studies, I also offer free Bible studies during the week at any time which may be convenient for you. We can study with you just about any public place, including restaurants, coffee shops, shopping mall food courts, etc. We can also schedule a study online using Google Hangouts. </p>\n<p>If there are other times which are free for you and you would like to study, please send me (Jason) a message.<br>\n\n</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/d/c/600_339302012.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px\"></p>\n<p>If you are interested, I also have an evangelism/apologetics website you can check out: <a href=\"http://www.evangelismhelp.com/\">EvangelismHelp.com</a>.

I'm starting this group after realizing how much my recruiter network in NYC helped me fill positions, build successful recruiting teams and grow as a recruiting professional. This is a group for those of us passionate about changing lives from a career perspective. Let's come together and share ideas, career opportunities, split recruiting assignments, learning lessons...you name it, let's network it! People all across the country are recognizing Pittsburgh as one of the best cities to live and work. And guess who's responsible for finding gigs for those relocating professionals and meeting the hiring needs of companies expanding here? YOU! We'll start with get-togethers once a month and see where it goes from there. So join and tell your recruiting colleagues. The more people, the more info to share!</p>",

This meetup community is a place for all wargamers, from recruits to grognards, to meet and organize play of two-player and multi-player or large group, classic and new, hex-and-counter wargames (such as Avalon Hill, SPI, Victory Games, Lock N Load, Avalanche Press, MMP), card-driven wargames (such as GMT produces), card wargames (such as DVG produces), block wargames (such as Columbia Games produces), tabletop miniatures games (that's where wargaming started), cube-pushing wargames (such as Queen's Shogun and games produced by Academy Games) and \"miniatures done as board wargames\" (such as Tide of Iron). Wargames and conflict simulations played here can range from tactical to operational or strategic level, and may include elements of resource management, production, trade and diplomacy. The games may be historical, fantasy, or science fiction themed. This meetup may also serve as a place for discussion of related topics on the Forums.</p>",

We have over 20 people showing at every meeting and will only take one member per profession. We are trying to keep it business-like, but fun and social as well. If you feel you can be a beneficial member of our group, please contact me for more details. I can then let you know if we have your profession open. As Meetup shows many people that have inquired about us, don't assume that your profession has been taken. Send a quick email to me and I will let you know.</p> \n<p>Our goal is to get together twice a month and exchange solid referrals. We would rather get fewer referrals than get some of the lousy ones we have gotten via the traditional networking groups. We will also be having some optional social gatherings, whether they be a happy hour type or hitting the links during the nice weather. We do not have any dues or fees associated with our membership. We meet the first and third Tuesday of the month at Pugliano's. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any concerns/questions.</p> \n<p>Ken Gress <br>Allstate Agency Owner <br>kengress@allstate.com</p>",

      "description": "<p><i>You’re invited to join our Saturday morning, <b>mountain bike group ride</b> starting from and ending at our Pittsburgh, Performance Bicycle store. The ride is for entry level mountain bike riders. The ride will begin and end at the shop, and will last approximately 1.5 hours. This is a mixed terrain ride including paved street, loose gravel, and technical mountain bike single track sections in the woods. We will ride on the streets until we reach Schenley Park. Once in the park we will ride along the main gravel trail, exploring the shorter single track sections until we arrive at Panther Hollow Pond. The ride leaves the store every Saturday morning, 9:00 am and is a “No Rider Left Behind” ride, however the planned route does contain physically demanding terrain and features . Come out and join our ride leaders, for some fun outdoors. Bring a helmet, water bottle, spare tube, positive attitude :)</i></p>",

      "description": "<p>I'd like to find all of the Adventure riders in the area. My idea of great ride would be riding the paved roads out of town to the mountains, finding some cool dirt roads or wide trails, and finding a place to camp out for the night. My days of trail blazing and jumping are over I think. The adventure bikes are just too heavy to try and imitate a dirt bike. I prefer quality miles and not just quantity. I don't like just humming along in a straight line, even on a country road, so I try to keep this to a minimum. But, where i live, you have to drive at least 50 miles to find some decent roads without traffic. My pace is quick on the street and slow off road. I like to keep a day's ride under 250 miles. I prefer overnight trips to day trips, so collect some gear and storage on your bike. Nothing fancy, a good duffle bag strapped to the luggage rack or back seat is good. I still prefer the street, so my rides will most likely be 80 20. Maybe in the near future some other organizers with put together rides for you dual-sport guys.</p>\n<p> <br> </p>\n<p> <br> </p>",

After living in DC for almost 10 years, my husband and I moved out to Detroit for a year. Missing our friends and social life in DC I joined a similar group in Detroit. Instantly, I met some really great people. Though I grew up in the South Hills, I have lived elsewhere since high school. I am looking forward to making new friendships. Group events include kids activities, family get-togethers, ladies nights, and date nights. Some activities I have done in the past that I really enjoyed were book discussions, cookie exchanges, wine tastings, and Indian holiday celebrations.</p>",

The group will be holding different activities such as: Brunches, Lunches, Dinners, Happy Hours, Movies, Live Bands , Karaoke, Casino trips, Spa Events, Medium Readings, Meet and Greets and Speed Friending Events.   The Meet Up for the meals will always be held for 8-10 people.  There are a few reasons for that: 1.  Most People prefer a smaller group for meals so they can actually spend time talking to everyone in the group and it is more personal.  There have been many complaints from the Meet Ups that have large groups for the meals because they said that they never even got to talk to anyone and only met the people sitting next to them and have considered it to be very impersonal.  I prefer to keep it at  a smaller group for that very reason.   2.  A lot of restaurants are not in favor of handling a group that is very large for these events.  However, there will always be events that will allow Open House/Open Membership to EVERYONE or there will be events where there will be 20 or 30 members or maybe just 8 or 10.  Please remember you can always sign up for the \"want a spot\" and keep checking for any cancellations.  You are always welcome!  The group will ALWAYS be held in the Aspinwall/Fox Chapel area ONLY.   This group is a great bunch of people who enjoy having FUN and who enjoy meeting new people.  Remember....that is what it is all about.   I'm really looking forward to meeting you : ) <br>\n\n</p>\n<p>                                                                                            Jan<br>\n\n</p>",

      "description": "<p>Reality Computing is a high-level concept in computing technology that integrates the digital and physical worlds. In Reality Computing, many different products and technologies are brought together in order to Capture, Create, and Deliver data and objects. Reality Computing technologies allow users to digitally capture the existing conditions of objects and locations (laser scanning, photogrammetry, depth cameras), compute and analyze that captured data in design software, and then realize, or create, the result back either physically (3D printing, digital manipulation) or visually (augmented reality, projection techniques). </p>\n<p>This group is for anyone interested in innovative technology that is changing the future. We will be having Meetup events during which representatives from successful Reality Computing companies will be speaking. Hope to see you around, and meanwhile if you want to know more check out <a href=\"http://realitycomputing.typepad.com/\">http://realitycomputing.typepad.com</a>.</p>",

      "description": "Join us on Pedego Electric bicycles for  ongoing adventure in Pittsburgh and surrounding areas. We cycle using regular pedaling, power assist and throttle on paths like the Great Allegheny Passage. There are a lot of different trips we go on  from 2 hours to day trips to multi day trips. Many in our group like to pedal and get a work out but we also like the option of using electric assist for various reasons. Most rarely use the electric assist but like having that option after a short or long ride. Beginners are welcome and bikes can be provided. Many of us have friends, spouses who have and use regular non electric bicycles. However, a lot of athletes who have worn knees or other limitations love the possibilities e-bikes offer. PedegoPittsburgh.com supplies the bicycles. Pedego bicycles owners are always welcome.",

Its Christianity for the skeptic and agnostic. In the end, the skeptic may, or may not, become a believer, that is their choice. But at least the facts are clearly analyzed and presented.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Take a look at this 2 minute video for an excellent explanation. <br> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAFlmuiA-eE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAFlmuiA-eE</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b> <br> </b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What will this meetup group do and accomplish?</b> <br> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This group is for discussion and debate about religion and Christianity, and also a book club for apologetics authors such as: Ravi Zacharias, JP Moreland, Alister McGrath, John Lennox, Os Guinness, William Lane Craig, Phil Fernandez, CS Lewis, and anyone from the Veritas forum, or any other apologetics author/speaker people are interested in. <br> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Books by skeptics and atheists will also be read in order to give an honest analysis to their claims and to compare to the claims of apologists.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We will also try and attend debates and Q/A forums at Universities all over the country. Sadly most of these are not in Pittsburgh. Watch this video for an example of such a Q/A session. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8XSa79sU0M\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8XSa79sU0M</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Basically we watch a difficult video or read a difficult book that challenges Christianity, and we try our best to refute it using apologetics books and materials, logic, common sense, and most importantly the Bible. We talk, a lot. Its mostly about discussion. If you want to listen, thats fine too. <br> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Who should join this group?</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you are interested in the Historic Jesus and Historic Christianity, philosophy, religion in general, or you are a Christian who is either struggling with their faith, or is strong in their faith but wants a deep and serious philosophic discussion about Christianity. Also if you are a believer in another religion or faith, or agnostic, or atheist, and would like to discuss Christianity or religion in general.&nbsp;</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Christians, people of non-Christian faiths, skeptics, and atheists are all welcome!!! <br> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>So what makes me qualified to run this group?</b> <br> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This type of discussion is usually done at the University level in Philosophy courses. I do not claim to be an expert in the area of Apologetics, my field of study is in Science and Engineering actually. In fact I'm just a guy in my late 20's working for a tech company, not a University professor. <br> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>But I have been a fan of apologetics authors, and have been listening to debates between Theists and Non-Theists and people of different faiths for years now. Its something which helps me a lot in my own faith. I'm a student of apologetics and Christianity like everyone else in the group. <br> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In fact our group currently consists of a few University Philosophy professors and pastors that have a lot more knowledge and experience than I do. The biggest thing I contribute is passion and enthusiasm for the subject of apologetics and the willingness to learn from others. I am always open to advice and everything in this group is 100% democratic. Everything we do is a group effort, and everyone has a say in everything. <br> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>When and where do we meet?</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We meet in the Panera Bread community room. The actual Panera Bread may change between meetings, depending on community room availability. As of right now, we either meet in the Oakland Panera Bread or in the Shadyside Panera Bread. <br> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We meet every 2 weeks. 2 meetings every month. The meetings are 2 hours long and usually on Saturday at 2pm. We usually have some assignment to complete before each meeting, such as watch a video, read part of a book, read an article, etc. During the meetings we discuss the assignment, watch videos, have formal debates between theists and atheists, and just talk about the subject of the assignment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Thank you for your time. <br> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>-Gene: Servant of Jesus Christ, Amateur Apologist,Bookworm, Nerd, Scientist, Engineer. <br> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you have any questions, please contact me at ysoroka86@gmail.com <br> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> <br> </p>",

Together, we'll do challenges and exercises in a public setting that will take us far outside of our comfort zones. The purpose of this is to get over irrational fears of being judged by others. We'll also meet new people and have a lot of fun in the process. Challenges will include: Talking to strangers*, dancing, and other activities that might be perceived as awkward or uncomfortable. Come set yourself free.</p>\n<p><br>*By talking to strangers, we mean talking to people outside of the meetup group. People within the meetup group are not considered strangers.</p>",

NAP and property rights are closely linked, since what aggression is depends on what a person's rights are. Aggression, for the purposes of NAP, is defined as the initiation or threatening of violence against a person or legitimately owned property of another. Specifically, any unsolicited actions of others that physically affect an individual’s property or person, no matter if the result of those actions is damaging, beneficial, or neutral to the owner, are considered violent or aggressive when they are against the owner's free will and interfere with his right to self-determination and the principle of self-ownership.</p>\n<p>Supporters of the NAP often appeal to it in order to argue for the immorality of theft, vandalism, assault, and fraud. In contrast to nonviolence, the non-aggression principle does not preclude violence used in self-defense or defense of others. Many supporters argue that NAP opposes such policies as victimless crime laws, coercive taxation, and military drafts. NAP is the foundation of libertarian philosophy.\"</p>\n<p><br>\n\n</p>\n<p>Government agents should not be above this moral law. Join us for some good food, drinks, and conversation.

      "description": "<p>Sunday Assembly is “a godless congregation that celebrates life”. We are a group of generally non-religious people that get together and listen to a talk, sing some fun pop songs, and eat tea and cake. That’s pretty much it. You can call it “atheist church”, “humanist church”, “secular community”—the labels are not as important is the intention, which is to help each other “live better, help often, and wonder more”. The monthly assembly is our flagship event for celebrating together and nurturing a wider secular community. The idea started in London in January of last year with Sanderson Jones and Pippa Evans, two stand-up comedians that decided they wanted the best parts of church/synagogue/mosque/faith-community “without the god bit”. They put the idea out to their community and got such an overwhelmingly positive response that the thing went a little bit viral, with 30 assemblies popping up worldwide practically overnight. Since then the thing has gone way viral, with about 80 new assemblies working to launch in September. “Well doesn’t my city already have a dozen secular groups and a few Unitarian churches?” I hear you asking yourselves? Yes, and thank goodness for that. We love these groups. We are not in competition with traditional secular organizations but instead hope to complement, energize and enliven them. The intellectual and cerebral aspect of our average secular groups is very important and indispensable, but it doesn’t often leverage the positive power of emotion, music and poetry, or just enjoying ourselves as a group. Also, the assembly format is very accessible to families with children and seems to attract a variety of ages. Come check us out!</p>",

Never add or eliminate medication or other treatments without first consulting your doctor or prescribing medical professional.</b></p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p>1. The goal of this group is not to sit in a circle in the basement of a local church drinking stale coffee holding a pity party for everyone! We are not less of a human being because nature decided to play a cruel joke on us. This group is here to provide us an opportunity to socialize with others who understand us. We have monthly(ish) Skype meetings and in-person meetings. There will also be opportunities to walk in local fundraising walk/5k and educational meetings.</p>\n<p>2. The exercise meetings are not hosted by anyone in particular. They are there to give people the opportunity to exercise with someone else who has similar health issues. If you want to go, sign up even if no one else says they are going. Sometimes it takes one person to start the trend.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. I LOVE getting new ideas and suggestions! Please do not hesitate to contact me. The only way I can schedule activities people want to do is if I know what those activities are and when is a good time to schedule them.</p>\n<p>4. Meetup.com charges $15/month for use of their website. At some point you may be asked to participate in a fundraiser to help raise funds to pay for the monthly fees. <br> <br>Keep in mind that you will get out of this as much as you put into it.&nbsp;I hope you find it beneficial! <br></p>\n<p>&lt;3 Jessi, with a big nod to the author, Amy ;-)</p>",

      "description": "<p>This group will be meeting once a month at the Fox Chapel Waterworks Mall at Panera. This group is for anyone who has suffered a loss and is grieving.  We will be meeting in the Conference Room so we will have privacy and the opportunity to share. This could be due to a recent loss or a loss from many years ago and you may have pain that has resurfaced for any reason. Please note that I am not a grief counselor but what I do know is that I have lost 13 family members in 13 years and 2 of them were children. I lost 15 friends in 10 years. I lost them due to illness, accidents and suicide. My heart has been repeatedly broken but I do know that the heart can and will heal and I believe that we can do this together. I have attended several grief support groups over the years and I can tell you that by telling your story and helping others....you also, will begin to heal. I believe that it is a great help and part of the healing process to just sit back, talk, listen, share and be a part of a group that \"just gets it.\" Coping skills is another great topic of discussion. Believe me...it really does and will help you to talk to others that \"have walked that road.\" We are all in this together as one.  I would also like this to be an opportunity for you to grab something to eat or a coffee.  I just wanted to let you know that you will have time to do that if you would like to purchase something.   I look forward to meeting you.      Jan<br>\n\n</p>",

      "description": "<p><b>Welcome to the Pittsburgh Collaborative Writers Meetup</b></p>\n<p>As is said in varying ways, the tools of communication change, but the ideas remain the same.  In this day, we have access to a writing tool unlike those available in the past: Google Docs.  This technology gives us new options for authorship, although in many ways the craft of writing has not changed.</p>\n<p>Google Docs is a free online tool that allows two or more people to edit the same document at the time and see the changes that the other person is making as they are being made.  Having this functionality allows for an immediacy of collaboration between writers in different locations in a way that could not have happened in the past.  As the word processor improved the craft of writing by making revisions easier, the question now is, how does this new tool change the way we communicate using the written word.</p>\n<p>This is a group for writers of all styles and all experience levels.  I have been a professional technical writer for more than ten years, serving as a journalist, writing content for the web, writing computer manuals, and writing fiction for my own amusement.  I look forward to using the tools of collaboration to help others:</p>\n<p>*  Learn to be more creative<br>\n\n *  Overcome writers' block<br>\n\n *  And to write more effectively</p>\n<p>During the Meetup we will write together, read what we have written, and collaboratively edit each other’s writing.  The goal of this group will be to improve our communication with each other and with our intended audiences.  As I would hope for other members of the group, I aspire to being accepting of all recommendations about my writing as I strive to produce the best product that I can.</p>\n<p>Each participant will need a laptop or tablet for every Meetup.  You will also need a free Google email address if you do not already have one.</p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing you there.</p>",

We believe this begins with a sense of belonging, a space where women feel safe among friends, where they are able to utilize their gifts and celebrate their uniqueness; where they can truly be themselves.</p>\n<p>Chapter 164 is based in the South Hills area of Pittsburgh, PA. Each month we come together for a whole bunch of different activities — from events focused on our children and families, such as playgroups and Mom &amp; Tot outings, to Mom-only activities that let us have some time away, such as programmed Chapter Meetings and Moms’ Night Out.

That's the idea behind P.E.P.talks, an ecumenical group designed to encourage aspiring women speakers to practice the gift of speaking well. This brainchild was birthed to give women a safe and nurturing platform to practice their craft. Selected members would prepare and present a short talk and give and receive feedback using an evaluation format. The goal is to help you establish your voice as a speaker while giving you the tools necessary to succeed. Our P.E.P.talks meetup will be at the Market District @ Robinson in Settlers Ridge from 6:30 - 8:00.</p>",

      "description": "The WESTMORELAND ENTREPRENEURS is a business networking group which is limited to one person per profession.  It was created by a core group of business professionals who were excellent at their professions, had integrity and a strong sense of community who wanted to meet other professionals who had the same excellence and integrity.  This core group of individuals was tired of spending too much time attending networking functions which turned out to be simply social functions which produced little to no leads or referrals.  They were also tired of spending hard earned capital to a networking machine that cranked out rules and regulations instead of goodwill and bonding between members.  What they created was a recipe for creating success.  With a little structure, a cup of relaxation and a pinch of fun, WESTMORELAND ENTREPRENEURS has become a terrific group of professionals dedicated to finding referrals for their fellow members and helping one another be as successful as they can be at their professions.",

While this group is sponsored by All Things Aquatic Dive Center and organized by our staff this meet-up is intended for EVERYONE!  Divers, or potential divers, of all ages and abilities, regardless dive shop or agency affiliation are welcome. We'll be hosting events and encouraging people to get involved with the sport. It is our intent to promote the sport, not the dive center. We hope that other dive centers will join us or co-host events all with the common goal of promoting this great sport.</p>",

We foster community, discussion, beer sampling, beer suggestions and socializing, as well as hopefully hosting educational events throughout the year. Have an idea for an event? Send your suggestion along! Have more ideas you'd like to share?

      "description": "<p>Many historians and others consider World War I to be the most significant event of the 20th century. Its influence continues to echo through modern life and culture.<br>\n\n</p>\n<p>I have always been fascinated by the Great War and its aftermath. I am not an academic or historian, but an amateur scholar who would like to learn more about the events and outcomes of the war. As the world observes the centenary of the war, this is a good time to find others with similar interests.<br>\n\n</p>\n<p>The structure of this group will be determined somewhat by the members.  I see this primarily as a study/discussion group, but we can expand to other activities (more on that below).   To get started, we'll have a reading/viewing list of books, websites, and films to get us all at the same starting point.  Then we can explore more areas - perhaps the flu pandemic, the Christmas Truce, portrayals in popular culture (WWI in Doctor Who, anyone?), etc.<br>\n\n</p>\n<p>\"Other activities\" could include watching a film or documentary as a group, having a WWI-era dinner, listening to/performing the poetry and music inspired by the war, sharing personal family histories, and so on.  A major project I am planning is a staged multidisciplinary performance featuring historical narrative, readings from letters home, period music and poetry.  Participation in this project is welcome.<br>\n\n</p>\n<p>This will be not just a military history, but an exploration of the war's social, cultural, and artistic heritage. Meeting times, locations, and frequency are all TBD. East End/east suburb locations are my preference, but other areas can be considered based on where people live and work.<br>\n\n</p>\n<p>People at all levels of interest are encouraged to join - from novices to professional historians.</p>",

All are welcome to attend regardless of your religious beliefs or level of Bible knowledge. We meet in a home in Brentwood for a meal, fellowship, Bible discussion, and prayer.</p>\n<p>Our group has a God-sized vision: We want to be used by God to facilitate a spiritual awakening in Pittsburgh. </p>\n<p>Of course, such an <span>awakening is ultimately a work of God. He's the only One who's able to awaken people from their slumber and enable them to see the truth about spiritual matters. </span></p>\n<p>Furthermore, God primarily does this as people hear the gospel proclaimed.</p>\n<p>We believe that the gospel isn't just the \"ABC's\" of Christianity but rather the \"A through Z.\" It's not just one class we take among many other classes. Instead, it pervades the entire curriculum. </p>\n<p>Therefore, our vision is to see the gospel transform our city. This begins with experiencing progressively greater gospel transformation in our own lives and then seeing that spread to people around us until the entire city is renewed by the gospel. </p>\n<p>What exactly does that look like? It looks like broken relationships being reconciled, poverty being alleviated, people experiencing freedom from the destructive impulses that dominate their lives, and--most of all--people being forgiven for their sins and made right with God. </p>\n<p>In other words, we believe that the gospel is the solution for all the problems our city faces.</p>\n<p>Now, it's great to talk about the gospel transforming our city, but we also have to think about how that's going to happen. Of course, as we discussed above, it will ultimately happen by God's power, as the Holy Spirit uses gospel proclamation to awaken those who are spiritually asleep. </p>\n<p>However, the entire church also has a vital role in all of this. Our role is to be the \"city on a hill\" that Jesus talked about in Mathew 5:14. And a central component of being a \"city on a hill\" is living in caring, authentic, and committed community with each other. Basically, showing people what true love looks like.</p>\n<p>That's the most powerful and persuasive testimony for the truth of the gospel--Christians living out the gospel in community with each other.</p>\n<p>Will you join us?</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit http://www.gracelifepittsburgh.com/community-bible-study</p>",

Ancient Chinese spiritual-philosophical text, Tao Te Ching, revealed the mystical truth of human life and provided extremely wise and precious guidance in regard to human living. However, as the content is so profound and the text so succinct that by nature this text has become as a pure “white light” and that all its individual readers throughout the past 2600 yrs. history could only perceive certain aspects of its reflected “seven colors,” meeting what is described in its text “Nature is like a bellows, Empty, yet never ceasing its supply when moving.” We hope, through mutual sharing of personal understanding of this text, group members of us all can be benefited in the growth of our personal spiritual pursuits as well as the improvement of our lives in terms of well-being and happiness.</p>",

      "description": "Hmmm. This is an invitation to join me in gathering together like-minded women who've experienced life for a while :) and are in pursuit of similar interests as I. I am an ardent student of A Course In Miracles; Quantum Physics and especially a dedicated practice of the application of its principles; the pursuit of clear consciousness and lucidity; the practices of breathing (refer to Max Strom); the acquiring of wisdom (refer to Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, Krishna, Sufi, Anais Nin, Steve Treu, Gary Zukav, Deepak Chopra to name a few); yoga (I'm very new to it but enthusiastic about its physical and spiritual rewards); the offering of compassion and kindness; and complete responsibility for self. This isn't a therapeutic nor venting outlet but rather a discovery and growth arena. I am forming this potential meetup because as I've progressed I am finding that most of my good old friends (whom I still and will always value) are not on the same page as I am and I'd like to connect with new friends who may be on the same page or at least reading the same book (metaphorically speaking). I live in the North Hills of Pittsburgh and am happy to travel southeast and north up to an hour for gatherings. At this point, I have not set a specific meeting time because my first step is finding women who are interested in such a pursuit. So if you are interested, please send me a note. Thank you very much. Debra Holz, 412-651-5051",

Bring your Maltin guides, ideas for games, and your vast movie trivia knowledge!</span><br></p>\n<p>Note: there have been a lot of requests to join the group, which we would love to honor, but for the time being, since I am funding the group out of pocket, we are keeping the group at the cheapest level and capped at 50. In the future, if we start charging dues or a fee for events, we might open the group up to be larger. Keep watching!</p>",

This is a group dedicated to educational meet-ups in the South Hills of Pittsburgh, PA, learning to identify and sustainably utilize local plants for healing and for eating. I will be offering educational plant walks in the area and classes on how to make the most from local plants and \"weeds.\" Many of these \"weeds\" are found in our own yards or nearby, and many of them have been found to help us heal a number of common ailments. You may be surprised what we find right in our.... neck of the woods!</p>\n<p>I am also highly interested in sharing the value of the local natural areas with the community, as they are an invaluable part of our day-to-day life, even if we don't see or notice them regularly.&nbsp; I plan to help conserve what areas I possibly can, <b>as what we call \"progress\" continues to creep into our already very limited natural spaces</b>, creating more light pollution and more traffic and wildlife problems more often than it should be.&nbsp; <i><b>But I need your help to do this</b></i>.&nbsp; I enjoy sharing these plant walks and classes and <b>hope that the community, if not already awakened to the need to conserve this land, will awaken and see what is beneath our very feet, and that we need to protect it to truly survive.</b></p>\n<p>Thank you for your interest in this group-- please contact me with any questions, ideas, or comments! <br> <br>Green Blessings! <br></p>",

This group is designed for Christians, especially singles to come together in Bible study and activities to glorify God. While primarily for Christian singles, this group is not exclusive. It is my belief, and therefore the stated belief of this group, in traditional Christianity, that the Bible is God's Word, and Jesus is God's Son. Discussion and even some challenges to these facts are acceptable, but the leader has the right to reign in public discussions as necessary.  Let us meet up and glorify God.

If you are interested or know anyone interested in investment and its role in wealth creation, consider attending the organizational meeting scheduled Saturday March 7th at the Triplex (7238 Fleury Way). We will begin at 9:07 A.M. This is a chance to learn about investing and is NOT \"get rich quick\". This is for those new to investing or mature investors. I believe we will all benefit from multiple perspectives. Expectations for operations will also be clarified during the organizational meeting.</p>\n<p>This is an opportunity to share experiences and hear from guest speakers on the various intricacies of investment.</p>",

This meetup will serve as a platform for meetings with Poles, Polish Americans and those simply interested in Polish culture in a number of settings and formats. If you are interested in Polish history, genealogy, food, foreign policy, etc., we will be regularly hosting and creating events to share and learn about these topics .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Interested in contemporary Polish music?

While I am a Cloudera employee, I welcome all interested parties to share events within the Pittsburgh Big Data community and post questions, comments, and jobs.</p>\n<p>Obviously, to start, I will have more Cloudera meetups to post until people start submitting content. But, I will do my best to find and promote any related events and stay closely aligned with the Hadoop Users Group (HUG) and any other suggested groups.</p>\n<p>Key interests right now within the ecosystem are the emergence of in-memory analytics like Spark, Storm, and Kafka; security best practices concerning kerberos, TLS, encryption, and database security (Apache Sentry); and what's next for Hadoop in this very fast-paced world.</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p> <br></p>",

This group was started to raise awareness about vedanta and reach out to everyone including those simply curious about it to those practicing it. For those who do not know what vedanta is about, here is a quote to get you started: \"Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity within by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work or worship or psychic control or philosophy, by one or more or all of these – and be free. This is the whole of religion. Doctrines or dogmas, rituals or books, temples or forms, are but secondary details.\" - Swami Vivekananda.</p>\n<p>For more information visit&nbsp;<a href=\"http://vedanta-pitt.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://vedanta-pitt.org/</a>.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Hello! Welcome to the South Hills Young Living Essential Oils Meetup Group. Here you will meet other people interested in alternative health and naturopathic healing via therapeutic grade essential oils.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Young Living Essential Oils are the industry leaders in essential oils. In fact, they are the industry standard oils with massage therapists and in many alternative healing practices. They are the only oils allowed to be used in Raindrop Technique, an emerging therapy. See below for more information. They are also used in hospitals throughout the U.S. They are even used intravenously in the Nova Vita clinic in Ecuador. They are very different than food-grade and perfume-grade essential oils (EOs) sold in many health food stores. Most health food store essential oils and other \"knock off\" companies are either synthetic, a few molecules are changed, cut with alcohol and other ingredients or are distilled quickly at high temperatures for fast, mass production, hence making the oils more affordably appealing, yet with no healing properties.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Young Living Essential Oils are true therapeutic-grade EOs. In fact, Gary Young coined the term therapeutic-grade for essential oils. They are the purest grade EOs on the market. They are the essence, the blood, the life force, the immune system of the tree, plant, shrub, bush, flower, fruit, seed, etc. Many households are learning how to replace many of their \"over-the-counters\" as well as prescription medications with therapeutic grade EOs. Children are learning to come to mommy or daddy for their lavender or peppermint oil when they need to be wound down or have a tummy ache! In fact, many pet lovers as well as veterinarian offices are working with the oils as well, with incredible success! Note: you only want to use true therapeutic-grade essential oils on your pets for safety purposes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Did you know that Young Living Essential Oils are the only oils allowed to be used in Raindrop Technique, a revolutionary way to bring balance and harmony to the body...physically, mentally, and emotionally. It is an emerging therapy in many massage therapist's offices, spas, alternative medicine clinics, etc. Raindrop Technique was created more than a decade ago. The molecules of therapeutic-grade EOs are so small they are the only substance on the planet which may actually cross the blood-brain barrier. You do not have to be a certified Raindrop Therapist to learn the technique or to give it to family and friends. You can also learn Raindrop to help boost your family and friend's immunity, such as during our cold winter months, by giving them Raindrop Technique. An additional note, oils for healing, cleansing and masach (hebrew word for anoint, which means to smear, spread or massage) are mentioned more than 250 times in the bible. There is an answer for everything through nature. Essential oils have been used for healing/medicinal purposes since the beginning of time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thank you for spending the time to get to know a little bit about Therapeutic-Grade Essential Oils and their incredible benefits!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We are looking forward to \"Meetup\" with all of you!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To your Health &amp; Well Being,&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sharon Bovalina, Young Living Essential Oils&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Member # 1818592</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p>* None of the statements on this site have been evaluated by the FDA.

      "description": "Have you ever been in public and seen someone reading a book you've read and wish you were one of those people who could just sit down and start talking to them about it, but realize that even if you were you wouldn't ever be so rude as to disrupt someone engrossed in what you know to be a great book? Or have you been at the gym and out of the corner of your eye, noticed that the person on the treadmill next to you has your favorite song on their workout playlist? Have you found yourself scrolling through all the Meetup events desperately wanting to find one to attend, but don't feel like drinking or dancing, or mingling with a bunch of single 21 year olds? Does your perfect night consist of reading/Netflixing at home quietly where you can watch season three of Parks and Recreation for the third time without judgement? If the idea of going alone to meet a bunch of bubbly strangers at a public space where you have to come up with a note card sized description of who you are and what you do freaks you out, THANK GOD. Leave the Extroverts to their raucous laughter and innate sense of belonging, while we drink coffee and wine and have conversations about the importance of Treat Yo' Self day. Or maybe go to lunch and enjoy someone else's company while we read separately together. Or maybe go to one of those weird wine painting classes you've secretly been wanting to go to, but could never find anyone to go with so you never did. No? Just me? This is a group for introverts that want to experience friendship in the comfort of like-minded individuals.",

      "description": "<p>This is a group for those people who like to walk outside at a leisurely pace (no, not Old Man pace but not crazy exercise addict pace either....); who like to walk/hike for 60-90 min, maybe the occasional 2 hours; who don't want to hike so long or far you have to carry a backpack; who like to sleep in; who want to meet in Pittsburgh proper. Though I don't require anyone to be a certain age, I envision this group will mostly be comprised of people in their 30's and 40's. The goal of each hike will be to finish in the allotted time frame, not cover a specific distance - we all have lives and want to know what time we can expect to be done, within reason. If pressed for a fitness level, I would recommend you be moderately fit and stable (eg, not need help balancing). Though we are primarily a walking/hiking group, there may be other community events like movies, dinners, games, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Things that will not be tolerated: No shows or same day cancellations. Just don't do it. It's annoying for both the organizers and the members and you will be removed from the group if it happens. The goal of the group is to actually make friends you plan to hang out with outside of meetup events, and no one wants friends who bail out.</p>\n<p> <br></p>",

There is a big diverse world around us, and God created it for us to discover and enjoy. This group is for anyone open to sharing new experiences, having lots of fun, building authentic and meaningful relationships, and learning more about God and Christ-centered faith! Whether it’s outdoor adventure, a friendly dinner, pick-up sports, bible study, volunteering, or just hanging out by a bonfire, the goal is to create a fun, supportive, open-minded, and inclusive environment without the pressures of religion or affiliation to any particular church. Whether you are a life-long Christian, just curious to learn more about it, or anyone in between, you are welcome. As the group is just launching, the activities will be open to suggestion. So let’s get together and see where God leads this new group!",

      "description": "Buddhist Forum\nHumans tend to seek truth in life. Thus science has advanced and civilization has been enhanced. The truth of life as such and its function (living) should be said the highest and most mysterious subject in this regard. Throughout the human history, many different sources, scientific as well as religious, have all continuously studied from different aspects in order to unveil the truth of such a mystery. However, among them, only what the teachings of Buddha Sakiamuni (Gautama, Siddartha) revealed some 2500 years ago can be said to possess the most rational conviction and to be the most objectively promising. The makeup of human life and its living sustain and continue by means of the law of karmic cause and effect, which may also perfectly explain the reincarnation of a person. Not until the understanding of such mechanism of the process of life should any ultimate Truth, such as Voidness, Love, God, all are One, etc., be substantially meaningful.\n    Our Meetup will have two parts. One is to study the fundamental doctrines of Buddhism, the other is for the discussion or sharing of any Buddhist concepts from the comparative-religious point of view. We hope through attending the meeting everybody will get strongly inspired to know to conduct a more meaningful and valuable life.\n",

Location, date and time we can decide together on through correspondence. Let's survive and start to prepare ourselves in every way possible!",

Our membership is open to everyone but typically comprises inventors, engineers, scientists, programmers, hobbyists, artists, roboteers, families, entrepreneurs, and arts and crafts enthusiasts. Our focus is on collaboration, education, and community outreach. We’re a benevolent group and do not promote or condone illegal activities. The term “hacking” is used in a benign sense, in the context of deconstructing and understanding objects and systems and re-purposing existing materials for new and innovative uses. We have events every Friday night (except for holidays), open to the public, and usually free, where people can come in for interesting talks or presentations and see the shop and what we have to offer. Details on any particular Friday night event are posted to the blog on our main page somewhere between a few days and a week prior to the event. We host several outside groups who meet in our space and whose events are also open to the public.

You could be just at the “idea” phase, have a product, be in production or successful with many customers. All entrepreneurs struggle with curve balls daily and this meetup is a space where you can talk through ideas and questions you may have while offering your own personal insights and experiences to each other.</p>\n<p>We typically meet once a week in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh and adjourn to an appropriate local venue within walking distance based on the turnout, time commitments and weather.

An ad-hoc vocal experience, Summer Sing is not intended as a performing group, but as a fun, weekly practice session until traditional choirs resume a regular rehearsal schedule. • Sing folk songs, canons, hymns, part-songs, madrigals • Vocal improvisation will draw on collective creativity and individual flexibility • Ear training and vocalizing with an emphasis on resonance and legato We will sing outside at the Second United Presbyterian Church of Wilkinsburg – the church adjoins a beautiful little neighborhood park with a sunny garden and big old shade trees. The church also hosts a free-play session in the park for kids and families each Thursday, which makes for a nice \"child-care by committee\" environment – with free snow cones! Ample, free street parking is also available. Key inspiration for this project comes from the teachings of Alice Parker and Ysaye Barnwell; aspirations from the recordings of Bobby McFerrin.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Finding a Christian to date is a little bit like finding that needle in a haystack. Let’s face it; the pool of eligible mates is not as large for us as it is for those in the secular dating arena. Even some of the online “Christian” dating sites can be disappointing. I would like this group to help bridge the gap and bring like-minded, born-again believers together for fun, friendship, and if it is God’s will, dating too. If there are any members who would like to post and host an event, please let me know and I will add you as an organizer. Let’s do this together! <br>The intent of this group is to bring like-minded Christians together for fun, food, and fellowship. 2 Corinthians 6:14 King James Version <br>14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? <br>“ It doesn’t say relationships, it doesn’t say marriage but its implication is that of any relationship with another person.” STEVEN JAMES DIXON</p>",

      "description": "<p>So how's your relationship? Are you fighting, arguing, drifting apart, lacking intimacy? If you would like to learn ways to improve your relationship with others who are experiencing problems, consider joining! I started this group to help people in relationships to be happier, get along better, get back that feeling they had when they first dated. I am a certified life coach specializing in couples coaching. Whether you come as a couple or only one half of the couple, your relationship will improve. The group discusses issues that they have or have had and learn solutions that worked and ways to solve problems. During the session I will privately coach couples, or one person in the couple, to help in a more direct way, while the group continues discussion.</p>\n<p>This is for married couple or those in committed relationships. This is not a dating or singles group.<br>Sessions are Monday evening from 7:00-9:00 p.m. in the north hills near Mcknight road. Please email me at icounselcouples@gmail.com for more information and location as it could change, but it will always be in the north hills.</p>\n<p>I am looking forward to meeting you!<br>Lynne</p>",

      "description": "<p>Bagels &amp; Bytes is technology-related peer learning and networking at its best! We are the local 501 Tech Club and Net2 affiliate group in the City of Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p>Bring your tech questions, ideas, and issues. Join our fellowship of nonprofit techies (professional and \"accidental\" are equally welcome) as we brainstorm, share ideas and solutions, and support each other! This group is very supportive and non-judgmental. There is no such thing as a \"stupid\" question at these meetings — all questions and topics for discussion are welcomed. We learn from each other in unexpected ways constantly, regardless of knowledge or skill levels. Hence, you don't have to be an \"expert\" techie to attend, just curious and interested in nonprofit technology.</p>\n<p>This group meets the first Wednesday of each month (except January and July) from 8:30-10 am. Meeting locations rotate every few months, but the group is always hosted by a local nonprofit org. We typically do a summer \"outing\" each June (2015 will be Bagels &amp; Bytes &amp; Critters at Animal Rescue League on June 3). We generally hold our December meeting on a Friday afternoon at Dave and Buster's at the Waterfront, our annual \"holiday party.\"</p>\n<p>Bagels &amp; Bytes is FREE to attend, but you must RSVP. Please register via phone or email at 412-397-6000 or bcnm@rmu.edu. You may also register online at http://www.rmu.edu/bcnmregistration.</p>\n<p>Learn more about upcoming events on our blog: <a href=\"https://bagelsbytesallegheny.wordpress.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://bagelsbytesallegheny.wordpress.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>Started: 2000</p>\n<p>Current organizer: Cindy Leonard</p>",

It would be great to get together for play dates with the kiddos all around the city. It would also be wonderful to do some non child-related activities as well on our down times such as trying restaurants and going to the movies. I see there are in nanny groups on here , so let's change that!",

      "description": "July 12, 2015 Enjoy a day cycling along the Great Allegheny Passage Rails to Trail between West Newton and Pittsburgh’s South Side in support of the American Red Cross. The American Red Cross Ride for the Red Steel Towns Trail Ride is a daylong cycling trip between West Newton and Pittsburgh. Riders can start at either end of the route - in historic West Newton or in Pittsburgh’s Southside - and return to their starting location. Riders can choose their own pace and any distance up to the 64 mile full course. Register today at : crowdrise.com/ridethesteeltowntrail For more info place this link in your browser: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/32941424/Ride%20for%20Red%20Flyer%20download.pdf The Steel Towns Trail Ride along the GAP Trail route will allow riders to enjoy the trail alongside the Youghiogheny and Monongahela Rivers, from West Newton through the historic steel towns of Boston, McKeesport, Duquesne, Homestead, The Waterfront and Pittsburgh’s Southside. The trail, recently completed to Pittsburgh, has a packed, crushed limestone surface for a smooth ride. Built mainly on abandoned rail beds, the trail is nearly level with the average grade of less than 1 percent. The ride between West Newton and Pittsburgh follows the Youghiogheny and Monongahela Rivers and travels through many historic local and reclaimed “Steel City” areas. Along the ride you will enjoy the rivers, historic industrial sights, parks, bike-only river bridges and other interesting cycling sights to make the day enjoyable and interesting while supporting the mission of American Red Cross. Riders are asked to solicit donations in support of the Red Cross totaling a minimum of $250 to participate. All proceeds from this ride will be donated to American Red Cross Disaster Relief and Military Family Support Services, and will help your neighbors in times of greatest need. All donors will receive a receipt from the ARC for charitable contribution records. Register today at crowdrise.com/ridethesteeltowntrail",

      "description": "There are many great women's meetup groups operating within the Pittsburgh area, but I've noticed a significant lack of groups in the Northeastern Pittsburgh area - Verona, Oakmont, Penn Hills (VOP). I'm starting this group to remedy that problem. This group is for women who want to get together, for the most part, in our own area of town. I'm hoping to attract a well-rounded group of women who are hopefully interested in some of the following: crafting/knitting, the arts, exercising/wellness, outdoors activities, dining out or just getting together for drinks. I'm new to this area of town so I'm hoping we'll have some long-time residents of the VOP area in the group to expose us to any unique experiences this area has to offer.",

      "description": "<p>I'm probably not moving to London or the Bay Area. Is it possible to be a professional Haskell programmer in Pittsburgh? Wouldn't it be nice to have a day job slinging Erlang or Elixir?. How about getting paid to hack Clojure? Maybe your dream job is coding Common Lisp or OCaml. Is there anything we can do to promote functional programming in our town? Can we be a little less passive? If there was a visible functional community in the area, could that help to create possibilities?</p>\n<p>With the possible exception of the multi-paradigm language Scala, I'm not sure there is a single functional programming language that's in wide enough commercial use here in Pittsburgh to support a significant work force. Likewise, potential employers might be averse to adopting FP for lack of a pool &nbsp;of such developers from which to draw. But perhaps all functional languages taken together as a whole could provide a suitable&nbsp;foundation. It's a concurrent and polyglot world now and our industry needs what the functional paradigm has to offer.</p>\n<p>The hope is that such a community could lower the barriers to adoption of functional languages&nbsp;for both employers and developers in our area.</p>",

      "description": "<p>One the most tragic things that I can imagine is for two people who might make a wonderful couple never get started because they were too afraid to say hello. This is not just another singles group. There are plenty of them on meetup that do a lot of fun activities. This group is aimed specifically at those who might need some guidance in the world of dating. We are not just going to post activities and hope people talk to each other. We will actively try and match people with others by age, interests and relationship goals. Please bear with me as we learn together how this will work. Membership will be closed once we reach a certain number while we work out the kinks. If you joined during this test period, your membership will remain free as long as you are a member. The rules:</p>\n<p>-You participate in this group at your own risk. Members of this group are not screened in any way. The organizers of this group and Meetup.com cannot be held responsible for anything negative that may happen to you as a result of this group.</p>\n<p>-Single means single. Do not waste other members time by posing as single while you have a significant other. If someone in your life would be upset that you are a member of this group, do not join!</p>\n<p>-3 no shows to events and you are out of the group.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;-Be respectful. Ask yourself: would a jerk do or say this? If the answer is yes, do not say or do that thing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;-Rejection sucks. It is painful and at times it can feel like the end of the world. It’s not. Handle it the best you can and understand that there are others out there.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;-If you find someone that you are going to date exclusively either through this group or another, please remove yourself from the group. You are welcome to rejoin if things do not work out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;-Answer any questions that may be required for membership honestly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;-Report any violations of these rules to the organizers of this group. Those found to be in violation of the rules will be banned immediately.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Thanks and have fun!</p>",

I'm starting my life over and looking to get out and meet some new people and do some new things. It's time for something different.</p>\n<p>I created the group for sober people, but at the same time this is not AA. I am myself a recovering alcoholic and understand the triggers and difficulties that come along with it, but we may have some Meetups at restaurants that serve drinks. I don't find it to be a problem if someone has a drink with their dinner. It does not bother me. The intent of the group is to get people out and social without meeting at the bar and drinking all night or meeting with a keg on the weekends. If there are people that may be triggered by being in a casual dining setting with alcohol let me know, and I will definitely plan some events where there is strictly no alcohol as well. I don't want to exclude anyone.</p>\n<p>Everyone in the group is now an Event Organizer. What does that mean? That means if anybody in the group has an idea they would like to plan they are free to schedule a Meetup. This may help add variety to the group. Have an idea? Post it. But all events shall be drug &amp; alcohol free, or at least keep the alcohol to a minimum and note that there may be alcohol in case some of the members may have triggers they are watching out for.</p>\n<p> <br></p>",

When you're ready to learn about alternative medicine and how it can benefit you, I'll do what it takes to help you. If you're willing to do what it takes, and ready to prove that you have what it takes to make your dreams come true, we should talk and do what it takes together.

Although all are welcome, it is contemplated that individuals in the group, as well people outside the group, will provide presentations in the area(s) of their expertise.</p>",

      "description": "<p>For the suffering, lonely, conscious or unconscious. Those who wish for solutions and actual support. To decondition and reprogram together. &nbsp;We all have ideas of solutions to see actual change. &nbsp;FETS offers a place for us all to heal and 'work' together in a new structure that we've been craving, offering guidance towards individual and collective self awarness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>FETS support group offers specific information in a tangible way that guides us to activate our light bodies together. &nbsp;Through tangible and necessary life applications that will help promote a less stressful lifestyle and environment. &nbsp;During the metopes, we'll be providing information through group and personal guidance along with a personalized 'Book of Illumination' that will help each person on their journey through self awareness. &nbsp;See more details about the life book on our website fromegotospirit.weebly.com. &nbsp;FETS meetups also offer structure that explains the different lifestyle choices that we've made, consciously and unconsciously, that have created the patterns and habits that either help or keep us stuck in patterns that don't allow us to evolve at a rate that reduces suffering. &nbsp;Along with the Life Book, each person has the opportunity to receive their personal Human Design chart that allows them to discover a strategy that is specific to them that gives them a 'road map' or 'gps' to follow to notice less stress and see more results through synchronicity and at the same time allows them to relax into a flow that is authentic to their ascension process. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Hello Dear Reader, if you have found our meetup and are here&nbsp;reading this that means that you are waking up and beginning to see and feel that the life that you have been living isn’t really your life and the world that you have been told is real, ever since you were a little child, isn’t really how the world is supposed to be. Something inside you is waking up like a volcano that has been sleeping for thousands of years and you didn’t even know that it was there.&nbsp; It’s creating shifts within you, in your perspective of the environment around you, your life style, your values, your choices, your relationships and the all the roles of your life on this planet at this time. You are searching for something or someone to help you understand what is going on and what to do with it. Or you have been riding this vibration for a while now and you are looking for help to get on the next level, or you are just stuck in pain and misery and you don’t know what you can do to get out of it. Ether way you have come to the right place and we are happy that you are here!</span> <br></p>\n<p>What is happening is the SPIRITUAL AWAKENING. There is a huge wave of SPIRITUAL AWAKENING&nbsp; all over our planet that has been going on for some time now. Different people from different parts of the world are opening their eyes for the first time. They feel&nbsp;and see that there is something wrong with the world that we are told is real and this “reality” that dictates the laws and the rules of our lives. This process of SPIRITUAL AWAKENING is very unique and very powerful and because of it happening now, we are able to go through a transformation and become who we are designed to be and create the world for us, our children and all of the future generations. A world that is completely different from the one that we have been living in. There are a lot of different factors and a lot of different levels of truth of why we have aloud everything to come to this. Right now, with the way the society is and what it’s telling us is moral and normal, it’s literally turning us in to animals,&nbsp; monkeys.(We’ll get in to this deeper) The time has come for all of us, all of the people in this world to wake up, come together and create&nbsp; necessary changes and see solutions!&nbsp; As of now the situation is simple and yet critical because people who will wake up in time will make it through the shift and be a part of the new world and the new reality.</p>\n<p>The reason why we are creating this meetup is to give access to the necessary&nbsp;information for the ones that are ready to wake up and the ones who are already going through this process. There is so much information out there right now about the SPIRITUAL AWAKENING and unfortunately a lot of that information is misleading and misguiding because of which a lot of good people are being tricked in to deviating from their path and focus on things that are actually meant to prevent them from waking up. Our intention is to create a place that anyone who is in search, anyone who is stuck, anyone that has any questions can come to and find exactly what they need in that moment to keep evolving spiritually. Get clarity and step-by-step instructions on what to do in every situation when they are stuck. We have been going through the SPIRITUAL AWAKENING process for a very long time now. We have the personal experience and we’ve put in the foot work of going through this process ourselves so we can guide who is in need and lost, this is a part of our life's mission, to do what we do and give to the people what we know. Always remember KNOWLEDGE IS POWER. The information that we have has empowered us and that is why it is important that we share this with the world and to experience the shared information that a lot already feel themselves. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This process of SPIRITUAL AWAKENING is a very powerful process and very difficult to go though on many different levels and there are a lot and I mean a lot of levels in this process. Some are easier then the others and some are very difficult and painful.&nbsp; They create unnecessary suffering with out the proper support systems that we’re lacking in our societies.&nbsp; We will brake down every level and all the factors as we see and understand them in order for you to have a clearer view and understanding of what’s happening and what to do about it. We are working on preparing all of the material that we have so far, in organized step-by-step instructions on the lay out of the whole thing.&nbsp; We will also give you the guidance from many other spiritual teachers and the information that they have, to make this process as quick as possible for you. The important things to understand is the fact that we can not do this for you, you are the ones that have to do the work on yourselves in order to be successful in the transformation. You will have access to all of the information you’ll need to make this work for you, we are showing you the doors you are the ones that will have to go through them.</p>\n<p>There are&nbsp;certain steps that you have to take and certain things that you have to do to put yourself on the vibration that will allow you to begin your spiritual journey. First step that you have to take is very important and it is taking care of your body. It might sound simple at first but there are many factors that come in to play when it comes to actually taking care of your body. The very first important things is to know and understand how the condition and the environment of your physical body effects you and your ability to evolve on all levels. There are so many factors in your environment that you are not aware of and how they directly effect your way of thinking, your way of seeing, your way of believing, your ability to understand and process information and your way of being.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This support group will look at many factors, including this one, and we’ll be hitting them all together!</p>\n<p>Supportive Tools:</p>\n<p>Each of us will receive a personalized 'Life Book' - areas in our life that need to be looked at and cleaned up to activate our DNA</p>\n<p>Activation Kits - helps to reduce stress so you can manifest and see results through synchronistic experiences more often - helps to produce a place of balance with in &amp; with out</p>",

I’m unable to fit them in my full time work schedule. So I decided to form this meet up group to support and mentor one another. This group is intended mainly (but not exclusively) for women with breast cancer who are single. You could be a survivor or currently battling breast cancer. We could get together, talk, listen, laugh, cry and share our stories.</p>",

By claiming the energy of our dreams, working with the dreams and sharing them with other dreamers in a safe and encouraging space we can make great changes in our lives and find a source of creativity, fun and adventure within ourselves.</p> \n<p>The foundation of becoming an awakened dreamer is dream journaling. We'll present basic journaling techniques and how to encourage our Dream Source to send us more dreams. One we have dreams to work with we can share them with others in a safe way that encourages us to take the positive energy of our dreams to make changes in our waking life. We will also cover using dreams as a source of creativity and problem solving, as a path to our own inner spiritual guides and as a fun place for exploration and adventure.</p> \n<p>Once we become dreamers who are capturing and working with our dreams we can begin the real adventure. We are not limited to worldly concerns in dreaming and can use our dreams in near-infinite ways to expand our horizons and abilities and to have fun. We can use our dreams as the basis for creative works using the images directly or as the source for writing. We can play in our dream by dialoging with dream characters or performing dream theater in a group, or by reentering our dreams to get more information. The adventures you can have with dreaming are limitless and are only bounded by your imagination. Dreaming is an adventure, dreaming is fun, and dreaming is about soul. Join a group of fellow adventures who desire to dig into these ancient depths!</p>",

      "description": "<p>Getting married soon, or know someone else who is? Element Church has partnered with TwoGether Pittsburgh (twogetherpgh.org) to offer marriage prep classes. The cost is FREE! Includes continental breakfast, lunch and an online relationship assessment worth $50. Also, every couple that attends receives a $100 gift certificate to Henne Jewlers towards their wedding rings! The class is being offered on Saturday, August 1, and it runs from 9 AM to 3 PM. Sign up at the Element Church website (www.TheElementChurch.com) FAQ <br>* \"Are these religious classes?\" - While this class is offered in a Christian church, it is not a religious class at all. There are no Bible verses quoted, no offering or donation solicited, etc. * \"Is it BORING??\" - We don't think so! We utilize video, group discussion, and lots of interaction between you and your future spouse to drive the classes. We actually think our process is quite engaging! It is a chunk of time to invest, but isn't a relationship you plan on having for your lifetime worth investing at least a few hours of prep time? * \"What if we are planning on getting married, but we haven't set a date yet? Can we still come?\" - YES! We think that investing in growing your relationship is a great idea, no matter what stage you are in. * \"How is this all FREE??\" - The class is provided by a Federal grant. All of the class materials, food, etc. is covered in the grant. The only thing they require is some basic paperwork to be filled out at the class. OTHER QUESTIONS??? Feel free to reply to this post or directly send me an email: rich@theelementchurch.com</p>",

We use them as a team for food. We win as a team, &nbsp;the team shares the winnings. &nbsp;It's a nice little perk of competing. &nbsp;We do have fun with this, so prepare to laugh and enjoy yourself.</p>\n<p>Since some of our team mates have moved out of the area, in an effort to sustain our team, we are making it a public meetup. So,&nbsp;<span>any ladies between the ages of 25 to 65 interested in playing trivia? Maybe you just need to get out of the house. Please come check us out. &nbsp;You won't regret it. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Because we have such a diverse team, we have a broad spectrum of knowledge hence the name \"Mixed Media\".</p>",

      "description": "<p>Shut Up &amp; Write! Meetup is a venue for writers to work in the company of other writers on a regular basis. Writing, whether approached as a profession or as an avocation, is an isolating activity. We provide this forum, writing resources and meeting times as a method of developing a community of creative people. We welcome people who are serious about ‘writing down the bones’ and are looking for the companionship of other writers.</p>\n<p>Meetup Format <br>Making the time to write one hour per week is an empowering and ultimately rewarding experience but it needs to serve as the foundation of your daily discipline. If you RSVP that you are coming, then please arrive 10-15 minutes before the start of the Meetup. The facilitator will lead introductions and then the group will write for an hour. There will then be 15-30 minutes of social time to get to know each other and possibly discuss personal writing successes such as getting published or overcoming writing resistance in some small way. No critiquing, exercises, lectures, ego, competition or feeling guilty.</p>\n<p>Writing is the only thing that, when I do it, I don't feel I should be doing something else. <br>Gloria Steinem</p>",

Tired of missing out on all of the daytime play groups and the opportunity to meet other similar moms? I am starting this group because, as a mom with a full time job/career, I feel like I miss out on a vital part of the parenting experience! And, since this is 2015, I refuse to believe that a woman cannot have a career AND be an amazing mom. I know that I am not alone. I'm just looking to create 'stay-at-home mom' opportunities for working moms in Pittsburgh. I hope that, if you are reading this, you understand where I am coming from and decide to join!</p> \n<p>PS. Play dates after 5pm ARE possible! Lol</p>",
