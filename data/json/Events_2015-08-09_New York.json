The workout fuses cardio, Pilates, isometric movements, plyometrics and Isometric poses into a 45-minute series. Burn between 400 and 900+ calories per hour, strengthen and sculpt infrequently used muscles, and drum your way to a leaner, slimmer physique – all while rocking out to your favorite music!</p> <p>Through continual upper body motion using our lightly weighted drumsticks, called Ripstix™, you'll turn into a calorie-torching drummer, POUNDing off pounds as each song flies by. Rock, rap, dubstep, pop and old school music fuse to create the POUNDtrack series, which is hand-selected by music enthusiasts, drummers and POUND founders Kirsten Potenza and Cristina Peerenboom.</p> <p>GET RIPPED WITH RIPSTIX™</p> <p>What would a drumming workout be without drumsticks? We’ve invented unique, lightly weighted exercise drumsticks that have been specially designed to get you ripped — hence the name: Ripstix™</p> <p>Twice the weight of a standard drumstick (¼ lb each) and slightly shorter in length, Ripstix are designed to maximize your workout by alter the physics of your arm movement to burn more calories</p> <p>IT WORKS.</p> <p>POUND combines easy to follow (and not complex or embarrassing) cardio moves with strength training and drumming. This combo works the entire body, raises the heart rate to a fat-burning zone, and forces each move to be as precise as a basic beat.</p> <p>Each 2-4 minute song is carefully calibrated with interval peaks and extended fat burning sequences, providing you with the best workout in the shortest span of time. After you’re done rocking out to the 45-minute POUNDtrack, you’ll have done 15,000 reps, performed over 30 extended interval peaks, and zipped through over 70 techniques without even realizing it</p> <p>\n\n\nI am offering 2 weeks free</p> <p>please watch my video to get an idea of how much fun we can have getting that beach body!  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEfy9XKiqQc\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEfy9XKiqQc\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEfy9XKiqQc</a></a></p> <p>please visit my website: catgarlo.com </p> <p> facebook: CatGarloFitness and see some reviews.

Some studies have shown that HIIT burns up to nine times more fat than traditional cardiovascular exercise and keeps your metabolism elevated for more than 24 hours afterwards. This means you are going to keep burning calories long after you have finished exercising.</p> <p>Boot Camp Workout. This intense circuit keeps your heart rate up, burns calories, and tones your whole body. With these circuits we will use body weight exercises alternating with calisthenics.</p>",

Over this two-day workshop, we will explore skills and practices that can be applied in a multi-faceted way to​ your work as an educator. This workshop is​ designed for parents, teachers and mentors of children ranging in age from early childhood to high school students. You’ll learn ​how to integrate permaculture ethics and principles into your school, classroom, community, curriculum and teaching designs. The workshop delves into the following ethos that is essential in contemporary education:​ I am curious to learn about how our relationship with nature’s patterns weaves people and places toward global healing.</p> <p>​This workshop is almost entirely hands-on and experiential. Games, movement, and observation will be used to explore the topic of designing regenerative educational systems through the following tools:</p> <p>   Childhood Passions​ ​as Tools for Learning<br/>   The Responsibility of Diversity    <br/>   A Permaculture Classroom Model <br/>   Mentorship as a Basis for Classroom Management<br/>   Place-making for Community Support<br/>   Zone Zero: The Center of the Educational Initiative</p> <p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/1RNiPjT\">Click for more info.</a></p>",

Learn from the best: the Institute of Permaculture for Children (IPEC). Over this two-day workshop, skills and practices will be explored that can be applied in a multi-faceted way to​ your work as an educator. This workshop is​ designed for parents, teachers and mentors of children ranging in age from early childhood to high school students. You’ll learn ​how to integrate permaculture ethics and principles into your school, classroom, community, curriculum and teaching designs. The workshop delves into the following ethos that is essential in contemporary education:​ I am curious to learn about how our relationship with nature’s patterns weaves people and places toward global healing.</p> <p>IPEC's two-day course is almost entirely hands-on and experiential. Games, movement, and observation will be used to explore the topic of designing regenerative educational systems through the following tools:</p> <p>Childhood Passions​ ​as Tools for Learning<br/>The Responsibility of Diversity<br/>A Permaculture Classroom Model<br/>Mentorship as a Basis for Classroom Management<br/>Place-making for Community Support<br/>Zone Zero: The Center of the Educational Initiative</p>",

On Thursday July 9th we will be hosting our first after work Happy Hour Social at The Lexington Hotel in Midtown NYC.</p> <p>Jazz Vocalist Vicki Burns will be performing a duo set with the extremely talented guitar virtuoso Ron Affif!</p> <p>We'll meet at 5pm for a cocktail at the bar for a meet and greet. Vicki &amp; Ron will be playing their jazz set from  6:00pm - 8:00pm. We will be meeting in the Mixing Room Bar off the lobby of the Hotel.</p> <p>The Mixing Room celebrates the Lexington New York City’s jazz age heritage Tuesday through Saturday evenings from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM with live music. These weekly performances include themes such as The Great American Songbook Revisited, Bebop and Beyond, and Modern Jazz Night.</p> <p>Here are links with more info:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/630852930385181/\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/630852930385181/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/events/630852930385181/</a></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lexingtonhotelnyc.com/dine/mixing-room\"><a href=\"http://www.lexingtonhotelnyc.com/dine/mixing-room\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.lexingtonhotelnyc.com/dine/mixing-room</a></a></p> <p>Come on by, bring a friend and let's get Social!</p> <p>See You at The Lex!</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>MORE ABOUT THE HOTEL:</b></p> <p>The Mixing Room seating areas are outfitted in a fusion of modern, classic and 1920s-inspired furnishings. The room’s rich color palette and eclectic textures hint at contemporary design influences among the hotel’s Art Deco legacy. The Lexington New York City’s art collection, curated by Paige Powell and anchored by works of Alba Clemente and Ruben Toledo, flows into the bar area and dresses the walls. An anthology of jazz melodies dance in the air and play tribute to the hotel’s past and present.</p> <p>Presenting seasonal cocktails with fresh juices and garnishes, as well as classic concoctions with a twist, highlights of The Mixing Room’s menu include The Fitzgerald with rum, Maraschino, fresh grapefruit juice, fresh lime and a grapefruit twist garnish; The Gimlet with vodka or gin, fresh lime juice, honey syrup and a splash of orange blossom water; The Sidewinder with Cognac, fresh lemon, Cointreau and a raw sugar rim; and The Mr. Lex Martini with vodka or gin, vermouth and a blue cheese stuffed olive. Patrons can order delectable appetizers with an Asian Flare off of The Mixing Room menu to top off the evening.</p>",

The Attic Rooftop &amp; Lounge is New York City's newest nightlife and after work hotspot.</p> <p>The 5,000 square foot bi-level space is located on the penthouse of the Hilton Garden Hotel, boosting indoor and outdoor space. The space is designed and has taken its inspiration from the golden era of Hollywood. The rooftop celebrates the bold patterns and relaxed environment of Beverly Hills pool lounges and outdoor gardens while the penthouse lounge, with floor to ceiling glass windows, is inspired by the robust architecture of Richard Neutra and the past contemporary Hollywood Hills vernoculor. It's a cozy lounge with a sunken living room feel. The color palette is silver and grey with warm woods. Large bars on each level, plush seating, bi-level DJ booths with state of the art sound system and multiple screens integrated into the design for corporate branding and event branding are some highlights of the space.

Kick the big red ball. Just don't kick your dog. Game. On.</p> <p><i><b>If you don't know, now you know ...</b></i></p> <p>If you've never played the game of kickball as a kid you must have grown up on Mars. But as a quick primer, it's a game with rules similar to baseball -- except instead of using a bat to hit a little ball, you use your feet to kick a ball about 10x the size of a baseball. Kick the ball, run to the base, avoid getting your ball caught mid-air or yourself tagged out. Easy. And <b>no athletic skill is necessary</b>, just the ability to kick! Go out and practice now to get ready. Kick the postman when he delivers your bills. Kick that neighbor who won't turn down his stereo. Just get kicking!</p> <p>If you haven't played the game in 20 years, here are the general rules we will be using <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64476072/Kickball%20Rules.pdf\"><a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64476072/Kickball%20Rules.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64476072/Kickball%20Rules.pdf</a></a>.<a href=\"http://www.neighborhoodsports.us/Rules/KickballRules/tabid/155/Default.aspx\">&lt;/a&gt;</a></p> <p><b><i>A $3.00 organization fee will be collected at this event, your host is in the running for hardest working person on meetup.</i></b></p> <p><i><b>The important stuff ...</b></i></p> <p>• This is a co-ed game so ladies don't be shy to sign up. And it doesn't matter if you have no athletic ability, you just have to be willing to have a little fun.</p> <p>• Dress for physical activity! You'll be kicking and running so wear your sneaks, shorts and a t-shirt.</p> <p>• Rain or similar un-favorable weather cancels the meetup. Not!</p> <p>• Check the meetup site before leaving for last minute updates as well as my mobile phone number.</p> <p>• Please <b>DO NOT RSVP</b> if you do not seriously plan to attend as space is limited. No flakes allowed!

The Attic Rooftop &amp; Lounge is New York City's newest nightlife and after work hotspot.</p> <p>The 5,000 square foot bi-level space is located on the penthouse of the Hilton Garden Hotel, boosting indoor and outdoor space. The space is designed and has taken its inspiration from the golden era of Hollywood. The rooftop celebrates the bold patterns and relaxed environment of Beverly Hills pool lounges and outdoor gardens while the penthouse lounge, with floor to ceiling glass windows, is inspired by the robust architecture of Richard Neutra and the past contemporary Hollywood Hills vernoculor. It's a cozy lounge with a sunken living room feel. The color palette is silver and grey with warm woods. Large bars on each level, plush seating, bi-level DJ booths with state of the art sound system and multiple screens integrated into the design for corporate branding and event branding are some highlights of the space.

We begin our program by 7:00 PM.</p> <p>TOPIC: The kick-off for this discussion will be delivered by Beth K. Lamont, the widow of Corliss Lamont, who was, himself, a staunch advocate of a more Socialized Democracy. He was a Champion of Civil Liberties, and the author of \"<a href=\"http://www.corliss-lamont.org/philos8.htm\">The Philosophy Of Humanism</a>\". The discussion will address the need for Social Justice in this country, and will look at the positions of advocates like Bernie Sanders and other public figures. Various proponents and supporters are invited to join the discussion. All points of view are welcome. Come meet with other Humanists for what will surely be an interesting conversation, and tell about your own perspective, and share with others your own vision for our Democracy.</p> <p>ADMISSION: Free, but annual HSMNY chapter membership ($25.00 singles / $35.00 couples) is encouraged.</p> <p>Note: This HSMNY Chapter Meeting Announcement Notice can be found on the HSMNY Web site at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1CoIT1x\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/1CoIT1x\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/1CoIT1x</a></a>.</p>",

The Attic Rooftop &amp; Lounge is New York City's newest nightlife and after work hotspot.</p> <p>The 5,000 square foot bi-level space is located on the penthouse of the Hilton Garden Hotel, boosting indoor and outdoor space. The space is designed and has taken its inspiration from the golden era of Hollywood. The rooftop celebrates the bold patterns and relaxed environment of Beverly Hills pool lounges and outdoor gardens while the penthouse lounge, with floor to ceiling glass windows, is inspired by the robust architecture of Richard Neutra and the past contemporary Hollywood Hills vernoculor. It's a cozy lounge with a sunken living room feel. The color palette is silver and grey with warm woods. Large bars on each level, plush seating, bi-level DJ booths with state of the art sound system and multiple screens integrated into the design for corporate branding and event branding are some highlights of the space.

We will release any limiting beliefs and practice diaphragmatic breathing. We will work through the 7 chakras and raise your energy, releasing any blockages in your energy field. </p> <p><br/>We will meet at the southern end of Sheep Meadow, by the giant rock.

Kick your neighbor. Kick your brother. Kick the big red ball. Just don't kick your dog. Game. On.</p> <p><i><b>If you don't know, now you know ...</b></i></p> <p>If you've never played the game of kickball as a kid you must have grown up on Mars. But as a quick primer, it's a game with rules similar to baseball -- except instead of using a bat to hit a little ball, you use your feet to kick a ball about 10x the size of a baseball. Kick the ball, run to the base, avoid getting your ball caught mid-air or yourself tagged out. Easy. And <b>no athletic skill is necessary</b>, just the ability to kick! Go out and practice now to get ready. Kick the postman when he delivers your bills. Kick that neighbor who won't turn down his stereo. Just get kicking!</p> <p>If you haven't played the game in 20 years, here are the general rules we will be using <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64476072/Kickball%20Rules.pdf\"><a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64476072/Kickball%20Rules.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64476072/Kickball%20Rules.pdf</a></a>.<a href=\"http://www.neighborhoodsports.us/Rules/KickballRules/tabid/155/Default.aspx\">&lt;/a&gt;</a></p> <p><b><i>A $3.00 organization fee will be collected at this event, your host is in the running for hardest working person on meetup.</i></b></p> <p><i><b>The important stuff ...</b></i></p> <p>• This is a co-ed game so ladies don't be shy to sign up. And it doesn't matter if you have no athletic ability, you just have to be willing to have a little fun.</p> <p>• Dress for physical activity! You'll be kicking and running so wear your sneaks, shorts and a t-shirt.</p> <p>• Rain or similar un-favorable weather cancels the meetup. Not!</p> <p>• Check the meetup site before leaving for last minute updates as well as my mobile phone number.</p> <p>• Please <b>DO NOT RSVP</b> if you do not seriously plan to attend as space is limited. No flakes allowed! If you RSVP and I notice that you have a number of no shows or have a history of last minute cancellations, you will be removed.</p> <p>• <i>Sorry, no guests allowed for this one.</i></p>",

      "description": "<p>Updated March 8th, 2015</p> <p>This is one of three sites/listserves that promotes weekly games that have been going on for many many years. Stall counts are used on occasion, cleats are optional, boundaries are flexible, and all skill levels are welcome!</p> <p>There are two ways to stay in touch outside of Meetup.com:</p> <p>- Follow us on Twitter: <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nycultimate\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.twitter.com/nycultimate</a><br/>- Like us on Facebook: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/nycultimate\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.facebook.com/nycultimate</a></p> <p>SPRING/SUMMER (Mar - Aug)</p> <p>As the city warms up we play four times a week. Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside as a backup.</p> <p>There are four days that we play:</p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br/>- Tuesdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br/>- Thursdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)</p> <p>Damien<br/>[masked]</p> <p>RIVERSIDE DETAILS</p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).</p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS</p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.</p> <p>+++</p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...</p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)</p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather. Our main location is Riverside Park with Morningside as a backup.</p> <p>There are two days that we play:</p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (108th and West End - Big Soccer Field)<br/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (108th and West End - Big Soccer Field)<br/>*Tuesdays/Thursdays at 6pm games don't last long due to decreasing sunlight.</p> <p>FALL (Sep - Oct)</p> <p>There are four days that we play:</p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Morningside Park (110th and Manhattan Ave)<br/>- Sundays at 4pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br/>- Tuesdays at 5:30pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br/>- Thursdays at 5:30pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)</p>",

NO CHEATERS!</p> <p><b>PLEASE ONLY RSVP if you definitely plan on showing up. </b></p> <p><b>Game Time:</b></p> <p><br/>6:00 pm (2-3 hours play while we have daylight)</p> <p><b>Cost: FREE!</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/d/9/0/600_387863952.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/f/b/6/600_387864502.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Disclaimer:</b></p> <p>Participation in activities is strictly voluntary and group members assume all risks in connection with activities; per Meetup.com's Terms of Service Agreements, organizers and hike/trip leaders are released from any and all forms of liability related to events.</p>",

      "description": "<p>So it's time for a do-over. PLEASE REMEMBER TO RSVP ON THE MEETUP GROUP PAGE!</p> <p><br/>There are many issues on the agenda to discuss.</p> <p>The Charleston shooting is still hot on the minds of everyone. Black Christian- church bombings often by self-proclaimed Christians like the Ku Klux Klan- were common during the tumultuous Civil Rights fights of the 1950s and 1960s. Hopefully the massacre at a black church in Charleston by an apparent lone wolf White Supremacist is not the beginning of a trend, but we need to discuss the incident, and what might be motivating someone to do this in this day and age. What motivates people to become White Supremacists (which is their constitutional right) in the first place? And what motivated this lone White Supremacist to commit such a brutal massacre against a peaceful prayer group that had invited him to pray with them? How do we counter the White Supremacist mindset?</p> <p>Also on the agenda is the apparent police militarization of our hospitals triggered by a recent trip to the emergency room at Richmond University Medical Center. Why is there is a need for 20 cops, a mini-police precinct, in a hospital emergency room filled with bed-ridden sick people? Why are our hospitals now turned into prisons? Why are hospital patients treated like prisoners (or worse than prisoners, at least prisoners get a phone call)? Do you know to assert your rights when a hospital attempts to detain you against your will?</p> <p>We are also looking to brainstorm for strategies for engagement with the outside and interact with the communities of Staten Island. Addressing black apathy on the North Shore toward political issues and turning out to vote is obviously of prime concern. Why are African-American Staten Islanders seemingly so apathetic when it comes to getting politically involved to confront issues that affect their communities. But Staten Island is majority white, how do we reach out to communities all across Staten Island, where many white people are simply ignorant as to the problems that plague their own island? This group is about uniting Staten Island against racism, police brutality, economic and social injustice, and asserting rights, liberty, and yes, social justice for ALL. None of the major civil rights battles would have been won without getting the white majority to see the errors of their ways. Getting a white congress and white president to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, getting an all-white Supreme Court to strike down school segregation and bans on interracial marriage. This should not just be a battle to get black voters to turn out in enough numbers to outvote the rest of the island as if Staten Islanders were divided against each other. Obviously that would be a losing strategy because even if every black voter turned out, there is still a white majority. From North Shore to South Shore, we need to learn how to interact with communities of all sorts and try to get people on our side.</p> <p><br/>To quote Chris Rock: \"There have been smart, educated, beautiful, polite black children for hundreds of years. The advantage that my children have is that my children are encountering the nicest white people that America has ever produced. Let’s hope America keeps producing nicer white people.\"</p> <p>How do we get white Staten Islanders to be nicer white people? :P </p> <p>Also, we lost one major battle with regard to the Trans-Pacific Partnership \"trade deal\" that would destroy American jobs (and send them to Vietnam where workers are paid 60 cents an hour), establish draconian intellectual property laws that would affect internet freedom as well as send the costs of medication skyrocketing. The TPP also threatens labor regulations, environmental regulations, and financial regulations. Congress passed Fast Track Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). A smiling President Obama signed it today. This means the president now has total power to negotiate the whole deal in secret, and Congress will not have any opportunity to amend it any way. However all hope is not lost. The TPP itself still needs to pass both Houses of Congress. Thanks to Fast Track, Congress will be presented with the entire shit sandwich that is the TPP, negotiated entirely in secret between Obama and major international corporations, and will simply have an up-or-down vote on it. We need to get Congress to give it a clear DOWN vote! </p> <p>This is not a one-issue group obviously, if anyone has any other ideas feel free to let me know! </p> <p>And yes, Flagship Brewery is open on Thursdays!</p> <p><br/>Otherwise I look forward to seeing you all again! :)</p>",

Michel (Laurent Lucas, WITH A FRIEND LIKE HARRY and CALVAIRE) is a born womanizer and professional hustler with a penchant for wooing friendless, vulnerable widows and divorcees. When he meets introverted single mom Gloria (Lola Dueñas, VOLVER) online and treats her to an electrifying first date, she's left completely smitten.</p> <p>Michel tries to swindle what he can out of the one-night stand, but his latest victim has other plans. Basking in the rush of new love, she frantically pursues him, witnessing the true depths of his depravity and offering herself as an accomplice in his seductive crimes. Having truly met their match in each other, the unhinged lovers embark on a deadly odyssey amplified by wild sex, unbridled jealousy and passionate forays into the dark arts. This smart and gory shocker breathes new life into the lovesick horror genre to serve up a chilling tale of white-hot desperation and terrifying devotion.</p> <p><img src=\"http://d1oi7t5trwfj5d.cloudfront.net/b1/22/485acd584456ac2970a8811abec9/alleluia-poster.jpg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Here's what the critics screamed about ALLELUIA:</b></p> <p><i>\"A gripping and poetic study of toxic co-dependency\"</i><br/>-- Robert Everett-Gordon, GLOBE &amp; MAIL</p> <p><i>\"Sends its audience down a rabbit hole of obsession…enthralling.

What information the financial model can give you and why it is necessary to build it, though much of it is a guess.</p> <p><br/>2. Income Statement Basics: Income statement structure, the meaning of different line items, and an overview of important ratios that measure operational and financial health of the company.</p> <p><br/>3. Modeling your business: We will start with a template and each of you will adopt it to your business. </p> <p>4. Revenues and Costs: We will discuss how to model different revenue streams, and estimate relevant fixed and variable costs.</p> <p><br/>5. Assumptions / Revenue and Cost drivers: The crux of the modeling is an ability to make good assumptions. Anyone can build a mathematical formula and propagate it forward, but the output is only as good as the inputs. We will explore how to make assumptions that are justifiable and achievable, what research needs to be done in order to figure out what those assumptions need to be and what strategic decisions you need to make in order to set stage for how those assumptions, such as growth rates, will evolve. </p> <p>6. Break-even analysis - i.e identifying the point in time at which your business becomes profitable.</p> <p><br/>7.

Jane Neal, a local fixture in the tiny hamlet of Three Pines, just north of the U.S. border, has been found dead in the woods. The locals are certain it's a tragic hunting accident and nothing more, but Gamache smells something foul in these remote woods, and is soon certain that Jane Neal died at the hands of someone much more sinister than a careless bowhunter.</p> <p><i>Still Life</i> introduces not only an engaging series hero in Inspector Gamache, who commands his forces--and this series--with integrity and quiet courage, but also a winning and talented new writer of traditional mysteries in the person of Louise Penny.

      "description": "<p>This run starts at the \"Wild Duck Pond\" area of the Saddle River County Park in Ridgewood. We will start at the beginning of the mile markers which is near the exit, not near the entrance. There's parking close to the beginning of the path. If you cannot park in the lot nearest the beginning of the path, you'll need to reenter the park and park in the next closest lot. The driving area of the park is U-shaped so to get to the parking lot closest to the start of the run, you essentially drive around the \"U\" and approach the exit to the last lot on the right (by the dog park).</p> <p><br/>We will start at the \"Wild Duck Pond Area\" and will turn around at some point. If you'd like to run additional miles, you are certainly more than welcome to do so as the mile markers make it simple to track your distance. Depending on the turnout we sometimes break off into little groups of two or three people, each of which may go at slightly different paces and/or distances. Regardless, if you wish to run at a slower pace, I am more than happy to run with you at your preferred pace. Nobody gets left in the dust. This is a fun run, not a competition.</p> <p>For those who wish to stick around after the run, we may get together at (insert favorite Ridgewood hot spot here) to relax, catch up, and share some laughs. When we do this, we usually get to the restaurant between 7:30 and 7:45. If anyone cares to join us that didn't come to the run, you are certainly welcome.</p> <p>We will run rain or shine, hot or cold. If you RSVP \"Yes\", please do your best to be on time as we'll only wait a couple of minutes past 6:30 PM to get rolling. If you have questions, comments, or doubts, feel free to email me. Looking forward to seeing you on Thursday.</p>",

If you arrive late to the game, you would have to wait until the game in progress is finished to join your team. Inserting people in the middle of the game disrupts the flow of the game, and it's not fair to players that arrived on time.</p> <p>Field Location:The field is located on the corner of West 102nd street and Amsterdam Ave. The entrance gate is located on west101st and Amsterdam ave. </p> <p>Directions: 1 train to 103rd St. Also, B or D trains to 103rd St stop</p> <p>Check the MTA's website for any service changes: <a href=\"http://www.mta.info/\">www.mta.info</a></p> <p><b>Time:</b> Please be there 15 minutes earlier so we can get set up.</p> <p><b>Late arrivals:</b></p> <p>If you arrive late to the game, you would have to wait until the game in progress is finished to join your team.

We will learn an inner technology called the four siddhis that will help us become more effective when others are angry, unreasonable or stubborn. These striking manifestations of wisdom are expressed in Buddhist art, ritual and practice.

In this hour event, The Love Guru will help you clear your blocks and release your fears and take you through fun, funny, wild and a bit wacky exercises to MANIFEST YOUR HUSBAND (OR WIFE)!</p> <p>Come With An Open Mind<br/>Come Open To Trying Something New<br/>Come Ready To Do, Do, Do!</p> <p><br/><b>MORE DETAILS:</b><br/>The Love Guru is a Spiritual Teacher, Intuitive Heart Healer and Love Expert (She's also trained as a Marriage and Family Therapist!) -- but these events aren't your typical self help / lecture style which are quiet and sometimes a bit boring. Sure you'll have mindshifts, you'll clear and heal some blocks that have been causing you to get no where in your love life, but you'll also have fun.</p> <p>This event is interactive. You'll be taking notes, yes. But you'll also be doing too.</p> <p>(Also, please note, if you are offended by a Spiritual Teacher/Healer who sometimes curses, is passionate and intense, and sometimes plays hip hop music during her classes, then this event is not for you. The Love Guru is definitely a new breed of guru!)</p> <p><br/><b>BRING TO THE EVENT:</b><br/>Come with water - this helps release and clear toxins, old energy and thoughts. We're going to be stirring up a lot of old energy here, so come with water to hydrate yourself and help in the healing process</p> <p>Come with a pen and paper too. No smartphones or electronic devices. We need good old fashioned notepads with you at the event. You'll want to take notes to review later and remind yourself of key points and spiritual principles shared with you.</p> <p>There will also be times when you will be journaling about your feelings and thoughts. Be open to receive and participate in the event. You won't be forced to do anything you're not comfortable with, but The Love Guru is holding the space for you at the event to MANIFEST LOVE!</p> <p><br/><b>AFTER THE EVENT:</b><br/>It is suggested that you take it easy. No alcohol or drugs (unless prescribed by your doctor and it's a must). It's key to spend some time alone for the rest of the night and the next few days so you can process all you learned and what you are ready to let go. Drinks lots of water and eat natural if you can. Spending time in nature is key. Try not to sedate yourself with distractions (going on dates, friends) or TV. Take a few days to be with yourself and connect more deeply with your True Self and Spirit -- again, processing all that came through. The Love Guru works on different layers while you are working with her one on one and at her events, so the more you are open to receiving, the more will come through for you.</p> <p><br/><b>DISCLAIMER:</b><br/>With all the information shared, there is also a disclaimer. The Love Guru goes into events with a certain agenda on her mind, this is what is presented here to you. But with that said, Spirit is the one who calls the shots and what was once downloaded on this page as to what will be covered, based on who signs up for the event and what your energy is calling to come through, this may change.</p> <p>Be open to have a unique and transformative experience. Psychic and supernatural things are a natural occurrence in The Love Guru's world and combined with your energy at the event, something exciting always comes through. </p> <p>\n\n\n<b>\"MANIFEST YOUR HUSBAND (OR WIFE)\"<br/>Thursday, July 9, 2015<br/>7-8PM</b></p> <p>(Please check on <a href=\"http://www.loveguru.net/beingsinglesucks\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.loveguru.net/beingsinglesucks</a> to confirm the location)</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>INTIMATE GROUP -- POWERFUL EVENT -- </b></p> <p><b>GET REAL LIFE STEPS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN!</b></p> <p>****************************<br/><b>Get Your Ticket - $250</b></p> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=2X3GRJKPLJCFN\"><a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=2X3GRJKPLJCFN\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=2X3GRJKPLJCFN</a></a></b></p> <p><b>MORE DETAILS at<br/><a href=\"http://www.loveguru.net/beingsinglesucks\">www.loveguru.net/beingsinglesucks</a></b></p> <p>****************************</p> <p>All Tickets Must Be Pre-Paid By 4PM The Day Of The Event.</p> <p>No Money Is Accepted At The Door, So If You Do Not Get Your Ticket In Advance You Can NOT Come.</p> <p><br/><b>TICKET POLICY:</b><br/>All tickets are non-refundable.

She was tired of looking for \"The One\" and wanted them to do it for her. Instead of it being a private website, as intended, it went viral. During that time Blaire blogged about her journey and the insights and guidance she was receiving from The Universe on how to date in an easier, more natural way. Not only did she receive transformation, but those reading her journey went through transformation with their love lives as well (many of them got married!). The book has loads of dating and relationship advice and there's extended Q&amp;A in the back of the book as a bonus. </p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>RAVE REVIEWS FROM PAST EVENTS </b></p> <p>\"Good to see you in the flesh last night. Your teachings are deeply empowering and were a blessing to all who attended\"</p> <p>\"Very inspiring class - thank you! I'm going to attend your Prepare Yourself For Love Workshop next week too!\"</p> <p>\"Your class was fun and enlightening\" \"Wonderful and insightful! The lightbulbs are going off in my head.

      "description": "<p><b>This Thursday </b>the EA-NYC group has been invited to join <a href=\"http://agorafund.org\">Agora Fund</a> for a presentation and hands-on research session.</p> <p>****</p> <p><b>When: Thursday,  7/09 (this week!), 7 - 9 P.M.</b></p> <p><b>Bring: A laptop (if participating in the second half; see below)</b></p> <p><b>The first hour will be a presentation by Eva Vivalt, founder of <a href=\"http://www.aidgrade.org/\">AidGrade</a></b>. Eva is an academic economist, at Stanford in the fall, and previously was a Young Professional at the World Bank. AidGrade gathers data from impact evaluations and conducts meta-analyses of the data. Eva will be sharing some of her most important lessons learned from analyzing the 600 studies in their database and from her work on impact evaluations.</p> <p><b>The second half of this event will be practical research, focused on education.</b> We'll be breaking into small teams of 3-4 each (bring your laptop if you're staying for this portion!). Our goal is to learn how a nonprofit's self-reported claims tend to compare against rigorous impact evaluation results (drawing from AidGrade's database). Are an NGO's claims a reasonable approximation of their actual activities and impact? Are they completely uncorrelated? What are impact evaluations missing, and are there any rules of thumb we can uncover to speed up the research process?  </p> <p>The results of the evening will be used by the Agora research team to help connect donors with high impact nonprofits matching their areas of interest.</p>",

Topics will include basic executables, commonly-used libraries, and DLLs that can be integrated into Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, Access, Powerpoint etc) via VBA.</p> <p><i>Bio</i>: </p> <p><br/>Matt Wong is the founder of Guarnerix, a startup company providing solutions for managing heterogeneous data. Prior to Guarnerix, he spent a decade at JPMorgan as an investment banker in their Securitized Products Group.

We will take extra precautions to keep our bags safe, but please avoid bringing valuables -- and it would be safest to run with your wallet on you.</p> <p>Please be aware that there are limited overhead lights, so it gets a little dark, and during winter months the bathrooms are locked and the water fountains are off. If you have a bike, make sure you have a lock because you'll have to keep your bike outside the track area.</p> <p>If you feel uncomfortable leaving your personal belongings at the track, you can drop them off at Ace Bar (531 East 5th Street between A and B) -- ask for Justin or Charlo and tell them you run with the team.  They will store our belongings for us.  ***Please note that they will not let you in without your ID so please bring that with you to the track.   <a href=\"http://www.acebar.com/about.html\"><a href=\"http://www.acebar.com/about.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.acebar.com/about.html</a></a></p> <p>See you there -- and please contact a Whippet captain if you have any questions!</p>",

Are you hoping to explore Chile and Argentina? Then join REI and Hostelling International USA for a special travel workshop exploring the nuts and bolts of traveling through Argentina and Chile. Known for its rich diversity of landscapes, cosmopolitan cities and extraordinarily dynamic culture, Argentina and Chile have quickly become major hotspots for travelers around the world. From the Pampas to Patagonia, from Santiago to Buenos Aires, there’s a breadth of activities to consider for the week-long traveler to the avid and adventurous backpacker. </p> <p>This travel workshop will cover different itineraries, recommended accommodations, managing with currency, budget travel tips, off-the-beaten path adventures and other essential elements of exploring Argentina and Chile. Paul will dispel myths about both cultures while simultaneously get you excited to move around the region affordably and safely. The presentation will also allow room for discussions and conversations, and Paul is happy to tailor some of the workshop focus based on audience interests. We look forward to seeing you there!</p> <p><br/>==========================================</p> <p>About The Presenter:</p> <p>Paul Kuhne currently works for Hostelling International USA (HI USA) as their Northeast Regional Engagement Manager. Paul has spent more than five years working in the nonprofit world, and the last three years working with HI USA, helping spread the word about hostelling and providing new travelers with the resources they need to go abroad. Apart from his work in the nonprofit world, he is an avid traveler, Spanish-speaker, writing enthusiast and hip-hop fan. Paul got his start traveling in college where he studied abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina, spending five months exploring the region and traveling around the country. </p> <p>During his time, he danced tango in Buenos Aires, walked across a glacier in Patagonia, hiked a mountain in Bariloche and rode bikes around the vineyards of Mendoza. From there, he traveled to other parts of South America too, including Venezuela and Chile, and later on, northern and southern Europe. He’s also backpacked through eastern and southern Africa, explored Hong Kong, and visited Israel, and hopes to make it to New Zealand and Australia soon. He’s exciting to deliver this travel workshop to REI members to share his deep passion for Argentina and Chile with future travelers. He currently lives in Boston, MA.</p>",

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.</p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.</p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.</p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br/>2. Spend more time socializing<br/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br/>5. Stop worrying<br/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br/>8. Become present oriented<br/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br/>11. Be yourself<br/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.</p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.</p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.</p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.</p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!</p> <p> </p> <p>Resources:</p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free. (Note: Although these classic articles are somewhat dated, decades of research on happiness reveal that findings on happiness tend to be extremely stable over time.)</p> <p><a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.335.9655&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change </a><br/>By S Lyubomirsky, KM Sheldon and D Schkade, 2005.  21 pages</p> <p><a href=\"http://internal.psychology.illinois.edu/%7Eediener/Documents/Kesebir-Diener_2008.pdf\">In Pursuit of Happiness: Empirical Answers to Philosophical Questions</a><br/>By P Kesebir and E Diener, 2008. 9 pages.</p> <p><a href=\"http://internal.psychology.illinois.edu/%7Eediener/Documents/Diener-Suh-Lucas-Smith_1999.pdf\">Subjective Well-Being: Three Decades of Progress</a><br/>By E Diener, EM Suh, RE Lucas and HL Smith, 1999. 27 pages</p> <p> </p>",

      "description": "<p>Dixon Place presents... as part of the annual HOT! Fest...<br/>FREE... w/ no drink minimum.. tho getting a drink supports Dixon Place and its artists!</p> <p>ABOUT THIS SHOW<br/>Known for rocking out on Appalachian dulcimer, DK and the Joy Machine brings her new, multi-media show to Dixon Place for this year’s HOT! Fest. With “quirky and smart” songs (from her new album SHY ONE) she addresses all the crucial questions in life: getting the girl’s number on the A train, falling in love with feral cats, being an androgynous grrrrl, and how to love yourself harder–even when that means telling others to fuck off. Joined by special guests, including Tine Kindermann on saw, DK’s eclectic music–from Americana, anti-folk to alt-rock and acoustic punk, blend with video, spoken word and other surprises from the lesbian underground.</p> <p>ABOUT THE ARTIST<br/>DK&amp;theJoyMachine’s new album, SHY ONE, has been described as “…intense, colorful and diverse … a novel of sorts. Dark, light, humorous &amp; humble. ” Her “quirky and smart” songs celebrate all the crucial things in life: unrequited love, falling in love with feral cats, and treating yourself with kindness. Known for her sultry, expressive voice, well crafted songs, and genre-blending, innovative work on mountain dulcimer—plucking, strumming, bowing and “rocking out” on this trad instrument, “DK”’s music is at turns evocative, moving, playful and fun, and always real. Her first studio recording, the EP, “Love Harder,” released in January 25th, 2013, was described by VENTS magazine as “an album with heart, …beauty, and passion. In every chord, note, or string you can feel poetry, sincerity, greatness… a record to closely pay attention to and be delighted by.”<br/>MORE INFO- doors 7pm, show 7:30pm<br/><a href=\"http://dixonplace.org/performances/feral-cats-and-wild-women-love-stories-from-the-lesbian-anti-folk-punk-underground/\" class=\"linkified\">http://dixonplace.org/performances/feral-cats-and-wild-women-love-stories-from-the-lesbian-anti-folk-punk-underground/</a></p>",

Normally, that would break the bank, but you can buy tasting portions of some very old wines (the bartender uses a needle to extract the wine, and then the cork seals itself, preserving the wine).</p> <p>Bar'Lees also stocks over 100 types of whiskeys from Scotland, the U.S., Australia, Canada, and more.

The gifts we were born to share come to fruition if we but dare to explore, expand, AND express our vibrational state. You can tune your Soul-Body to higher dimensions and progress your visionary abilities following the scale of sound and color - starting where you are and who you are at the present moment and then climbing up.</p> <p>The starting point is like looking at a hiking map with a little red circle that says 'you are here' and all the possible trails ahead and then you take off - transcendence path is a process that is anchored in the body. No matter how natural and sacred, there is no vine, shroom, or chemical that will take you to the next level of spiritual consciousness. You can change your state and catch a glimpse of your transcendent vision, yes, right here within your Soul-Body.</p> <p>Sound Mind is about a durable and steady progress into who you were meant to become in this amazing moment of opportunity that we call a human life. It goes fast, so why not …make a sound?</p>",

      "description": "<p>The book for July is <b>I SHALL BE NEAR TO YOU by Erin Lindsay McCabe.</b></p> <p><i>An extraordinary novel about a strong-willed woman who disguises herself as a man in order to fight beside her husband, inspired by the letters of a remarkable female soldier who fought in the Civil War. Rosetta doesn't want her new husband Jeremiah to enlist, but he joins up, hoping to make enough money that they'll be able to afford their own farm someday. Though she's always worked by her father’s side as the son he never had, now that Rosetta is a wife she's told her place is inside with the other women. But Rosetta decides her true place is with Jeremiah, no matter what that means, and to be with him she cuts off her hair, hems an old pair of his pants, and signs up as a Union soldier.</i></p> <p><br/><i> With the army desperate for recruits, Rosetta has no trouble volunteering, although she faces an incredulous husband. She drills with the men, proves she can be as good a soldier as anyone, and deals with the tension as her husband comes to grips with having a fighting wife. Rosetta's strong will clashes with Jeremiah's while their marriage is tested by broken conventions, constant danger, and war, and she fears discovery of her secret even as they fight for their future, and for their lives. Inspired by more than 250 documented accounts of the women who fought in the Civil War while disguised as men, I Shall Be Near To You is the intimate story, in Rosetta’s powerful and gorgeous voice, of the drama of marriage, one woman’s amazing exploits, and the tender love story that can unfold when two partners face life’s challenges side by side.</i></p>",

And it's not too late for you. Crokinole is one of the easiest dexterity games to learn.</p> <p>It's like a combination of shuffleboard, curling, and billiards - played on a small table-top board. You flick small discs with the aim of knocking off your opponent's pieces and placing yours in good scoring (or snookering) positions.</p> <p>It's jolly fun and social. We play every week in a great Greenpoint bistro (Milk and Roses). We have the back of the place reserved specifically for us, every Thursday night from 7pm-11:30pm.</p> <p><br/>Feel free to come anytime. Jump in a game. Watch if you prefer. Drink and food specials for all players ($8 burgers and pasta; $3 beers).</p> <p>We'll have several boards out (depending on the number of RSVPs).</p> <p>Good music too, including live piano for a couple of hours (9-11pm).</p> <p>If you RSVP 'yes,' please make sure you come or change your RSVP to 'no' if your plans change. I bring boards from home, based on the number of people down to play. And as you may know, they're not light. Hence, the importance to me of following through with your RSVP...</p> <p><br/>Thanks and hope to see you there!</p>",

How often do we get an opportunity to be real with each other in New York City?</p> <p>We play 3 communication games (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). Imagine meeting new people in an environment where people felt comfortable to be themselves. That's what we have created.</p> <p>It's a refreshing change from the typical networking or bar conversation.</p> <p>You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening – to your responses.</p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!</p> <p>At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can have the life that you want.</p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. In an hour and some you may even forget for a moment you are in New York City.</p> <p>OneTaste NYC is an organization teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM. The games we play at TurnON are designed to create the visceral sensation of Orgasm/OM in your body, without having to actually do the practice (or remove any clothing!).</p> <p>It's a friendly invitation to play and push your edges in a way that feels good. This allows you to stretch yourself and inspires self-discovery!</p> <p>We start on time so please arrive fifteen minutes early. Near the Lincoln Center.</p> <p>COST TO ATTEND IS $10.</p> <p>For info contact Michal at [masked] or call[masked]-2255. Can’t make this event? see www.turnonny.us for more. Directions to venue:</p> <p>Our address is the Metropolitan Opera Guild, 70 Lincoln Center Plaza, 6th Floor. We are located in the Samuel B. and David Rose Building at Lincoln Center, equivalent to 165 West 65th Street, between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. The Rose Building is adjacent to the Walter Reade Movie Theater and both are next door to the Juilliard School. From the street, take the elevator, escalator, or stairs up one level and proceed through the revolving door of the lobby of the Rose Building. You will need to check in with Security in the lobby and they will have your name on a list. Proceed to the 6th Floor.</p>",

I’m too much!” </p> <p><br/>All this chanting can be boiled down to two words: “I’m Hungry.” </p> <p><br/>Many of us simply have a fundamental hunger to connect with another human being.

It’s going to be a conversation about orgasm that actually works with the woman’s body.  When you have this, this whole notion of frigidity, shame, shyness or lack of sex drive flies out the window.  What it’s replaced with is an entire life time of a journey of discovering of who you are and how your particular orgasm works.</p> <p>This is an intimate conversation among women about our desires.

      "description": "<p>Dear Woman,</p> <p>My name is Eugenia and I’m writing to invite you to our TurnedOn Women’s Panel. We don’t have secrets from you. We would like to share with you what it means, looks and feels like to be a TurnedOn woman. </p> <p>Our topic is simple!</p> <p>Orgasm! </p> <p>Have you ever caught yourself or your female friends chanting some version of, “I work too hard! I eat too much! I diet too much! I drink too much! I shop too much! I give too much! I’m too emotional! I’m too much!” All this chanting can be boiled down to two words: “I’m Hungry.” Many of us simply have a fundamental hunger to connect with another human being. Instead, all we do is reach out for substitutes in our life to fill the void without realizing that we abandoned our desires in order to fit in, look good, and have the approval of our community, family, and friends.</p> <p><br/>In our discussion about orgasm and what it means to be a TurnedOn woman, we will share with you a different way and definition of orgasm. It’s not going to be a conversation about that fleeting moment of climax. It’s going to be a conversation about orgasm that actually works with the woman’s body. When you have this, this whole notion of frigidity, shame, shyness or lack of sex drive flies out the window. What it’s replaced with is an entire life time of a journey of discovering of who you are and how your particular orgasm works.</p> <p>This is an intimate conversation among women about our desires. We open up to talk about how to connect your hunger with you desires, say what you want in real time and have your way with the world in achieving and receiving everything you want in life.</p> <p>Doors for this event close at 8:10</p> <p>COST TO ATTEND IS $10</p> <p>For questions feel free to contact Marissa at [masked] or[masked]</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9QVq0EM6g4\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9QVq0EM6g4</a></p>",

      "description": "<p><i>This Thursday Only is TurnedOn Women's Panel!</i></p> <p>Dear Woman,</p> <p>My name is Eugenia and I’m writing to invite you to our TurnedOn Women’s Panel. </p> <p>We don’t have secrets from you.  We would like to share with you what it means, looks and feels like to be a TurnedOn woman. </p> <p>Our topic is simple!</p> <p>Orgasm! </p> <p>Have you ever caught yourself or your female friends chanting some version of, “I work too hard! I eat too much!  I diet too much! I drink too much! I shop too much! I give too much! I’m too emotional! I’m too much!” </p> <p><br/>All this chanting can be boiled down to two words: “I’m Hungry.” </p> <p><br/>Many of us simply have a fundamental hunger to connect with another human being. Instead, all we do is reach out for substitutes in our life to fill the void without realizing that we abandoned our desires in order to fit in, look good, and have the approval of our community, family, and friends.</p> <p><br/>In our discussion about orgasm and what it means to be a TurnedOn woman, we will share with you a different way and definition of orgasm.  It’s not going to be a conversation about that fleeting moment of climax. It’s going to be a conversation about orgasm that actually works with the woman’s body.  When you have this, this whole notion of frigidity, shame, shyness or lack of sex drive flies out the window.  What it’s replaced with is an entire life time of a journey of discovering of who you are and how your particular orgasm works.</p> <p>This is an intimate conversation among women about our desires. We open up to talk about how to connect your hunger with your desires, say what you want in real time and have your way with the world in achieving and receiving everything you want in life.</p> <p>Doors for this event close at 8:10</p> <p>COST TO ATTEND IS $10</p> <p>For questions feel free to contact Marissa at [masked] or[masked]</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9QVq0EM6g4\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9QVq0EM6g4</a></p>",

The “Prayer for our Nation” conference call is the second Thursday of every month at 8:30 PM eastern (7:30 central).  The Daniel Team is led by Luis Chiang.   You do not need to be a member of the Christian Party to participate in the prayer conference calls or the other monthly conference calls for the Christian Party.   If you would like to become a member of the Daniel Team, please send an email to <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]</a> requesting to join the prayer ministry.  Thank you.</p> <p>For more information about the Christian Party of America, go to <a href=\"http://www.christianpartyonline.com/\">www.ChristianPartyonline.com</a>.  And Please like us on Facebook at: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Christian-Party-of-America/198905400159491\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Christian-Party-of-America/198905400159491\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Christian-Party-of-America/198905400159491</a></a></p> <p><b>Prayer Objectives:</b></p> <p>1.  True repentance, in the hearts of our citizens, which manifests itself in our daily lives.</p> <p>2.  The healing and restoration of families in America.</p> <p>3.  The restoration of Biblical principles employed in the ruling of our nation from the local to the national level.</p> <p>4.  To teach the Church to maintain this righteous life so that once America is restored we will continue to teach the Body (including our children) to maintain godliness in our personal and public lives.</p> <p><b>Prayer Strategies:</b></p> <p>1.  We need to search our hearts and ask the Lord to reveal to us any sins that may be preventing Him from fully answering our prayers. (Joshua 7:10)  Once revealed, we need to confess our sins to Him (and repent of them) and, if appropriate, to those whom we offended.</p> <p>2.  We need to assume the sins of the nation on ourselves; just as Daniel did for the sins of the nation of Israel (Daniel 9).</p> <p>3.  It is absolutely crucial that in all these endeavors that prayer be our primary focus.  We need to rely on prayer (Jesus) as the foundation for everything that we do.  In addition, prayer teams need to be set up that will pray before, during, and after all events, etc. in order to bath in prayer everything that we do.  These prayer teams will be the “heavy lifters” who will be moving heaven and earth for us as we fight to regain our nation.</p> <p>4.  We should follow (among other prayers in the Word), the prayers of repentance and requests for restoration that we find in the Bible, as we pray for our nation.</p> <p><b>Prayer Focus:</b></p> <p>1.  Jesus is the only way and the only power that will enable our nation to turn around (2 Cor 7:14). We need to focus on Him and to trust in Him alone, as we confess and turn from our sins; that He will tear down the strongholds of the enemy in our nation and in our individual lives. “When the enemy comes in; like a flood the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him.” (Isa 59:19). We must not trust in any tactic, procedure, or whatever in order to overcome the devil (who is behind all of the evil that we see around us). “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.” Ephesians 6:11-13</p> <p>2.  We need to ensure that we stay focused.  The enemy (Satan) will try different tactics against us, e.g., to get our focus off of that which is most important and to either divert our attention on that which is least important and/or try to get us to do too much.  He will probably try to bring division amongst us.  My guess is that it would be through misunderstandings, hurt feelings, etc.  We must be aware of this up-front, expecting the attacks and to realize that the attacks are coming from the enemy and not from what we can, e.g., see with our natural eyes.</p> <p><b>Prayer Tactics:</b></p> <p>1.  We need to find appropriate Scriptures to stand upon to bring before the Lord as we pray individually and corporately.  It is crucial that we not follow a hard fast cook book approach; even one that is based on the Bible.  We need to know what the Scriptures say and then to allow the Holy Spirit to use what He’s taught us to do or to pray those things that He brings to mind or puts into our hearts to do.  For example, don’t have the “Hail Mary” prayer approach, e.g., I always have to pray this way or to pray these prayers in this exact order.</p> <p>2.  The Church needs to be actively involved in politics and other social endeavors such as education, health care, the legal system, etc. (if even just knowing what is going on). In politics, the Body should then intelligently and with Christ-like love contact their representatives making their viewpoints known.  These godly leaders need to then rally the Body perhaps at local auditoriums, stadiums, etc. in order show the Church the truth about how our nation began and how the Church was actively involved in all facets of social life for the first few hundred years of our pre- and post-national existence.  The Body needs to learn that we must stand on what God’s Word says and to fight for what’s ours (just as the Israelites entered the Promised Land, fought huge giants, and won). </p> <p>Finally, remember:</p> <p>2 Chron 16:9 “For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him…”</p> <p><b>PREPARATION FOR PRAYER-STUDY MATERIALS</b></p> <p><b>Repentance from Idolatry</b></p> <p>All the sins described below are the symptoms of a bigger sickness, which is denying God as our creator and not glorifying him and acknowledging him as the supreme ruler of the universe. Rom 1:29 states “All Unrighteousness” stems out from the root of idolatry (Rom1:23). So, fornication is not a sickness, it is one of the symptoms of idolatry, covetousness is not a sickness, it is another symptom of idolatry, etc.</p> <p>It is very important to focus our prayer efforts on this first cause of sin, which is ignoring God, suppressing the truth, and replacing the Creator by the created. God and truth are self-evident, but we choose to rebel against it. What we need is to repent from that.</p> <p>Studying the nature of repentance would help tremendously in our efforts to pray and intercede for people because repentance is the key to come back to God and be healed.</p> <p>Rom 1:18  For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</p> <p>Rom 1:19  Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed <i>it</i> unto them.</p> <p>Rom 1:20  For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <i>even</i> his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</p> <p>Rom 1:21  Because that, when they knew God, they glorified <i>him</i> not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</p> <p>Rom 1:22  Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</p> <p>Rom 1:23  And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.</p> <p>Rom 1:24  Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</p> <p>Rom 1:25  Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</p> <p>Rom 1:26  For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</p> <p>Rom 1:27  And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.</p> <p>Rom 1:28  And even as they did not like to retain God in <i>their</i> knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</p> <p>Rom 1:29  Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</p> <p>Rom 1:30  Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</p> <p>Rom 1:31  Without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</p> <p>Rom 1:32  Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</p> <p>Here’s an example of what causes repentance:</p> <p>Let’s pray that America focus on the much that we have, so our hearts is filled with thanksgiving for his goodness towards us, and our hearts lead us to repentance.</p> <p>Rom_2:4  Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</p> <p>Let’s pray that the end result of America’s tribulations, the recession, the aging and health deterioration of Americans, the financial distress, etc. work for our good, changing our hearts and drawing closer to God.</p> <p>2Co_7:10  For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</p> <p>Let’s pray that America realize that God wants every American to be saved and not face judgment. Let’s pray that our pastors emphasize the human responsibility in determining our final destiny</p> <p>2Pe_3:9  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</p> <p>Other observations on the word Repentance</p> <p>The word repentance is used in connection with God, as well as with man. When it is used in connection with God, it is usually positive. God never repents to do good for his people. God repents himself from exercising judgment and punishment on his people.</p> <p>Let’s pray that God will change his mind executing the punishment that we deserve.</p> <p>Num_23:19  God <i>is</i> not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do <i>it?</i> or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?</p> <p>1Sa_15:29  And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he <i>is</i> not a man, that he should repent.</p> <p>Psa_110:4  The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou <i>art</i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.</p> <p>Psa_135:14  For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.</p> <p>Jer_18:8  If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.</p> <p>Satan is the God of this world. He endows his faithful servants with power to promote sin from the top down. In that sense, it is very important to know that sin is not based on grass root strategies; it is a highly organized well-funded push strategy.</p> <p>Blindness comes from Satan.</p> <p>Let’s pray in the Name of Jesus and bind Satan’s power, rebuke his authority, and order him to take away his hands off America. Let’s pray that the spiritual veil be torn and people be able to see what’s evident.</p> <p>2Co_4:4  In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.</p> <p><b>Joh 12:40</b>  He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with <i>their</i> eyes, nor understand with <i>their</i> heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</p> <p>The realization of our sinful nature comes when we get in contact with God the Holy Spirit, and his different manifestations. In that sense, we are also empowered to expose sin because the Holy Spirit dwells in us and we can testify of him through our actions.</p> <p>Let’s pray that God produces growth in us, and the works of faith that glorify Him “in us” serve as testimony that he lives. Let’s pray that the Holy Spirit be poured over America, so people be able to experience his conviction and turn away from idolatry.</p> <p><b>Joh 16:8</b>  And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</p> <p>Isa 6:5  Then said I, Woe <i>is</i> me! for I am undone; because I <i>am</i> a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.</p> <p>Luk 5:8  When Simon Peter saw <i>it,</i> he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.</p> <p>Let’s pray that we Christians devote our time reading the Word of God, so he continues the process of sanctification and purification. Let’s pray for zeal for his word, and that God appoints servants with the task of preserving the word of truth so the undiluted message is extended to the next generation.</p> <p>Joh 17:17  Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</p> <p>The realization of our sinful nature comes when we get in contact with God the Holy Spirit, and his different manifestations. In that sense, we are also empowered to expose sin because the Holy Spirit dwells in us and we can testify of him through our actions.</p> <p>Let’s pray that God produces growth in us, and the works of faith that glorify Him “in us” serve as testimony that he lives.

Let’s pray for zeal for his word, and that God appoints servants with the task of preserving the word of truth so the undiluted message is extended to the next generation.</p> <p>Joh 17:17  Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</p> <p><b>Excerpts from the Book of Daniel (Chapter 9):</b></p> <p> “…3 So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes.</p> <p>4 I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed:</p> <p>“Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments, 5 we have sinned and done wrong. We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have turned away from your commands and laws. 6 We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes and our ancestors, and to all the people of the land.</p> <p>7 “Lord, you are righteous, but this day we are covered with shame—the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, both near and far, in all the countries where you have scattered us because of our unfaithfulness to you. 8 We and our kings, our princes and our ancestors are covered with shame, LORD, because we have sinned against you. 9 The Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him; 10 we have not obeyed the LORD our God or kept the laws he gave us through his servants the prophets. 11 All Israel has transgressed your law and turned away, refusing to obey you.</p> <p>“Therefore the curses and sworn judgments written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out on us, because we have sinned against you. 12 You have fulfilled the words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing on us great disaster. Under the whole heaven nothing has ever been done like what has been done to Jerusalem. 13 Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come on us, yet we have not sought the favor of the LORD our God by turning from our sins and giving attention to your truth. 14 The LORD did not hesitate to bring the disaster on us, for the LORD our God is righteous in everything he does; yet we have not obeyed him.</p> <p>15 “Now, Lord our God, who brought your people out of Egypt with a mighty hand and who made for yourself a name that endures to this day, we have sinned, we have done wrong. 16 Lord, in keeping with all your righteous acts, turn away your anger and your wrath from Jerusalem, your city, your holy hill. Our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors have made Jerusalem (America) and your people an object of scorn to all those around us.</p> <p>17 “Now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your servant. For your sake, Lord, look with favor on your desolate sanctuary. 18 Give ear, our God, and hear; open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your Name. We do not make requests of you because we are righteous, but because of your great mercy. 19 Lord, listen! Lord, forgive! Lord, hear and act! For your sake, my God, do not delay, because your city and your people bear your Name. ”</p> <p><b>Excerpts from the Book of Ezra (Chapter 9):</b></p> <p>After these things had been done, the leaders came to me and said, “The people of Israel, including the priests and the Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices, like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians and Amorites. 2 They have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them. And the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness.”</p> <p>3 When I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled. 4 Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice.</p> <p>5 Then, at the evening sacrifice, I rose from my self-abasement, with my tunic and cloak torn, and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the LORD my God 6 and prayed:</p> <p>“I am too ashamed and disgraced, my God, to lift up my face to you, because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens. 7 From the days of our ancestors until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today…</p> <p>10 “But now, our God, what can we say after this? For we have forsaken the commands 11 you gave through your servants the prophets when you said: ‘The land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples. By their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other. 12 Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.’</p> <p>13 “What has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt, and yet, our God, you have punished us less than our sins deserved and have given us a remnant like this. 14 Shall we then break your commands again and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us, leaving us no remnant or survivor? 15 LORD, the God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence.”</p> <p>5.  Pray that the Lord will rise up godly pastors (or Church leaders) who will agree to work together to preach and teach on preparing the Church, e.g., to first of all pray and fast for our nation in small and large gatherings (at work during lunch hour, at home, in parks, at church, at social gatherings, etc.) around our nation; asking the Lord to have mercy on America (as we, as Christians confess our sins of idolatry, ambivalence, etc. to Him.  Also, these leaders should teach of the need for the Church to be actively involved in the world (to be the salt and the light of the world).  But, everything - absolutely everything should be focused on love; the Father’s agape love being shown to the world.  “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.  By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.” (John 13:[masked])</p> <p>As an example of a godly leader raising the awareness of God’s people to gather together in repentance, is Ezra:</p> <p><b>Excerpts from the Book of Ezra (Chapter 10):</b></p> <p>“While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites—men, women and children—gathered around him. They too wept bitterly. 2 Then Shekaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel. 3 Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law. 4 Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage and do it.”</p> <p>5 So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath. 6 Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.</p> <p>7 A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem. 8 Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.</p> <p>9 Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain. 10 Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel’s guilt. 11 Now honor[a] the LORD, the God of your ancestors, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives.”</p> <p>12 The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: “You are right! We must do as you say. 13 But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing. 14 Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us.” 15 Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this.</p> <p>16 So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases, 17 and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women.”</p>",

Some workouts include...</p> <p><br/><b>30 minute continuous run.</b> Sprint up the 0.4 mile incline, touch the graffiti wall at the top, turn around and jog back to the bottom and then repeat.</p> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/81450322\" class=\"embedded\">http://vimeo.com/81450322</a></p> <p><b>Timed interval sprints</b>. 45 seconds as hard as you can up. 1 minute and 45 seconds recovery jog back to the start.

Sprint to the first, do a bunch of situps. Sprint to the next, do some lunges. Sprint a bit further and do some squats. Sprint to the top and do some pushups. Jog back to the start and repeat.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/d/6/8/600_372083912.jpeg\" /></p> <p>This event is officially hosted by <a href=\"http://www.therisenyc.com\">The Rise, NYC.</a> They host morning workouts every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings.

Andra founded SPARE (<a href=\"http://sparenyc.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://sparenyc.org</a>) when her son turned two months old and built a large part of the business with a baby on her hip.</p> <p><br/>When she's not prowling the city on a mission to fight hunger, she can be found reading in fuzzy toe socks, ripping down the mountain in her skis, cuddling babies, and dancing around aimlessly. Andra lives in the South Bronx with her dog, cat, baby boy, and fiancee.</p> <p>There will be a time for Q&amp;A/networking afterwards so please email us any questions you may want her to address.</p> <p>Feel free to forward this to your friends that you think may be interested!

We will meet at the Arch of Washington Square Park 11:45AM and We'll walk to one of the lawn to have our yoga practice. It's open-level, so whether you're beginner, intermediate or more advanced, you can always modify your poses accordingly. </p> <p>What To Bring:</p> <p>Yoga mats, yoga props if needed, bottle of water, and your friends. I have a few yoga mats I can bring just in case someone needs it. Personally, I prefer the grass. </p> <p>What NOT To Bring:</p> <p>A full stomach. It's advised that we should practice yoga Asanas on an empty stomach. But if you feel you need to have something, let it be light, like a juice or smoothie.</p> <p>Any questions, or if you can't find us, contact me at[masked]-8318.</p> <p>Look forward to meeting and sharing the yoga practice with all of you.</p> <p>Your NYC Yoga Meetup Organizer,</p> <p>Wai Mark (known as Mark to friends)</p> <p>How to find us:<br/>We will meet at the Arch at 11:45AM</p>",

Refreshments at 4:30 pm, Show is taped from 5:00 - 6:00 pm</p> <p><b>Location</b>:  MNN El Barrio Firehouse Studio  175 E 104th Street, New York, NY</p> <p><b>Directions</b>: The studio is located on E. 104th Street between Lexington Ave and 3rd Ave.  Take the 6 Train to 103rd St Station and walk 1 block north.</p> <p><b>Stay Informed</b>:  Join our Meetup <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Open-Mic-On-Education/\"><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Open-Mic-On-Education/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Open-Mic-On-Education/</a></a></p> <p><b>Format</b>: Arrive at least 15 minutes before taping; you will be greeted and seated.  When you are introduced, come up to the mic and deliver a 1-2 minute 'elevator pitch' on your topic.  Then, stay at the mic for a conversational interview with our panel, and field some questions from the audience.  (Note that all questions are friendly and positive; the show is not a \"got-you\" kind of environment.)</p> <p><b>Prep</b>:  Please send via email or bring with you a short bio (one or two highlights is all that's needed) and any media (images, audio or video) that you'd like us to incorporate either into the Live show or for use as B-roll during editing of your segment.  Media may be emailed to [masked].  Alternatively, you may bring the media to the studio on a thumb drive, CD, or DVD, which will be returned to you after we make a copy.</p> <p>Again, thank you for planning to join us.  We hope you will become a regular presence at our a show and a contributing member of our community.</p> <p><b>Alan Rudt<br/>(917)[masked]<br/>[masked]</b></p>",

This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.</p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue.

      "description": "<p><b>Panna Rittikrai's</b> <b>Vengeance of an Assassin</b> will be getting it's North American festival premiere as part of the <b>NY Asian Film Festival</b>.</p> <p>Here are the details:</p> <p>There will never be another Panna Rittikrai. Vengeance of an Assassin is the final, brutal battlesong from the master of mayhem who discovered Tony Jaa and put Thai action cinema on the map. A no-holds-barred all-you-can-eat action fiesta, delivering everything from badass games of soccer to high-impact gun-fu, Vengeance of an Assassin is also the heartwarming story of two buff orphans who believe in filial piety and tearing thugs apart like warm bread. When the older brother (Thai stunt king Dan Chupong) leaves home in search of the truth behind their parents’ deaths, a trail of secrets, carnage, and more carnage follows him wherever he goes. When he’s forced to team up with his little brother (21-year-old Nantawooti Boonrapsup, all grown up since 2010’s Power Kids), it becomes an ass-kicking family affair. The master of single-take destruction, Rittikrai delivers Buster Keaton–style train brawls, flying sledgehammers, copious gun fights, and one glorious Freudian double impalement. In the scorching, sweat-drenched dreamlife of Panna Rittikrai, family and honor are everything, and justice can only be achieved through superior skill and righteous physical destruction.</p> <p><br/>THAI WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES | FORMAT: DIGITAL PROJECTION | 99 MINUTES</p> <p><br/><b>We will be attending the 6pm show.

      "description": "<p>Our City Party Tour is one the most popular of all our events. We turn NYC into one massive party. Everyone gets a pair of special headphones that stream 2 different genres of music to dance to. As we party, our resident tour guide Dave Cervini will be talking into the microphone that streams directly to your headset with interesting facts. In addition to leading the tour, he'll also lead the whole group to flash mob, dance, and shout out to all the unsuspecting onlookers around.</p> <p>The party starts at The Playwright Irish Pub for drinks before we make our way to Coney Island by subway. Once we reach the beach, the party is on! We’ll be in and out of luna park where we’ll end up at Coney Island’s only OUTDOOR BEACH FRONT Bar to party the night away under the stars and firework show.</p> <p>Tickets can ONLY BE PURCHASED ONLINE. <a href=\"https://quietevents.com/events/coney-island-fireworks-party-tour/\"><b>Follow this link to get yours ASAP as they are almost sold out.</b></a></p> <p>Age Restriction 21+</p> <p>What you need<br/>Metro Card, Valid ID, Credit Card (Just for security return of headphones)</p> <p>How it works<br/>Arrive for registration and happy hour drinks. A valid Photo ID &amp; Credit Card will be needed. In the event you do not return the headphone, you will be charged an additional $50. With the headphones on, we’ll be traveling in the streets and subway. You can adjust the volume and choose between two master mixes with a flip of a switch. Each headset has a color LED that shows what you are listening to, so you can dance along with those listening to the same music as you. If you need to leave at any point, just hand your headphones into the organizer and you’ll receive your registration paper. We end at a bar in which the headphones are returned and you’re more than welcome to party till dawn.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Our City Party Tour is one the most popular of all our events. We turn NYC into one massive party. Everyone gets a pair of special headphones that stream 2 different genres of music to dance to. As we party, our resident tour guide Dave Cervini will be talking into the microphone that streams directly to your headset with interesting facts. In addition to leading the tour, he'll also lead the whole group to flash mob, dance, and shout out to all the unsuspecting onlookers around.</p> <p>The party starts at The Playwright Irish Pub for drinks before we make our way to Coney Island by subway. Once we reach the beach, the party is on! We’ll be in and out of luna park where we’ll end up at Coney Island’s only OUTDOOR BEACH FRONT Bar to party the night away under the stars and firework show.</p> <p>Tickets can ONLY BE PURCHASED ONLINE. <a href=\"https://quietevents.com/events/coney-island-fireworks-party-tour/\"><b>Follow this link to get yours ASAP as they are almost sold out.</b></a></p> <p><b>Age Restriction 21+</b></p> <p>What you need<br/>Metro Card, Valid ID, Credit Card (Just for security return of headphones)</p> <p>How it works<br/>Arrive for registration and happy hour drinks. A valid Photo ID &amp; Credit Card will be needed. In the event you do not return the headphone, you will be charged an additional $50. With the headphones on, we’ll be traveling in the streets and subway. You can adjust the volume and choose between two master mixes with a flip of a switch. Each headset has a color LED that shows what you are listening to, so you can dance along with those listening to the same music as you. If you need to leave at any point, just hand your headphones into the organizer and you’ll receive your registration paper. We end at a bar in which the headphones are returned and you’re more than welcome to party till dawn.</p>",

It is once again time for us to ... Dodge. The. Ball.</p> <p><i><b>If you don't know, now you know ...</b></i></p> <p>If you've never played the game of dodgeball as a kid you must have grown up on Mars. But as a quick primer, it's a game in which players on two teams throw large balls at each other while avoiding being hit themselves. That's it. And <b>no athletic skill is necessary</b>!</p> <p>If you haven't played the game in 20 years, here are the general rules we will be using with a few modifications: <a href=\"http://www.wwcc.edu/CMS/fileadmin/PDF/Athletics/Intramurals/Dodgeball_rules.pdf\">Dodgeball Rules</a></p> <p><b>A $3.00 organization fee will be collected at this event, your host is in the running for hardest working person on meetup.</b></p> <p><i><b>The important stuff ...</b></i></p> <p>• This is a co-ed game so ladies don't be shy to sign up. And it doesn't matter if you have no athletic ability, you just have to be willing to have a little fun.</p> <p>• Dress for physical activity! You'll be dodging and running so wear your sneaks, shorts and a t-shirt.</p> <p>• Rain or similar un-favorable weather cancels the meetup. Not!</p> <p>• Check the meetup site before leaving for last minute updates as well as my mobile phone number.</p> <p>• Please <b>DO NOT RSVP</b> if you do not seriously plan to attend as space is limited. No flakes allowed! If you RSVP and I notice that you have a number of no shows or have a history of last minute cancellations, you will be removed.</p> <p>• <i>Sorry, no guests allowed for this one.</i></p>",

At that time, Ono advertised her “one woman show,” titled <i>Museum of Modern [F]art</i>. However, when visitors arrived at the Museum there was little evidence of her work. According to a sign outside the entrance, Ono had released flies on the Museum grounds, and the public was invited to track them as they dispersed across the city. Now, over 40 years later, <i>Yoko Ono: One Woman Show, 1960–1971</i> surveys the decisive decade that led up to Ono’s unauthorized exhibition at MoMA, bringing together approximately 125 of her early objects, works on paper, installations, performances, audio recordings, and films, alongside rarely seen archival materials. A number of works invite interaction, including <i>Painting to Be Stepped On</i> (1960/1961) and Ono’s groundbreaking performance, <i>Bag Piece</i> (1964). The exhibition draws upon the 2008 acquisition of the Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection Gift, which added approximately 100 of Ono’s artworks and related ephemera to the Museum’s holdings.  <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1544\">keep reading</a></p>",

      "description": "<p>Our City Party Tour is one the most popular of all our events. We turn NYC into one massive party. Everyone gets a pair of special headphones that stream 2 different genres of music to dance to. As we party, our resident tour guide Dave Cervini will be talking into the microphone that streams directly to your headset with interesting facts. In addition to leading the tour, he'll also lead the whole group to flash mob, dance, and shout out to all the unsuspecting onlookers around.</p> <p>The party starts at The Playwright Irish Pub for drinks before we make our way to Coney Island by subway. Once we reach the beach, the party is on! We’ll be in and out of luna park where we’ll end up at Coney Island’s only OUTDOOR BEACH FRONT Bar to party the night away under the stars and firework show.</p> <p>Tickets can ONLY BE PURCHASED ONLINE. Follow<b> <a href=\"https://quietevents.com/events/coney-island-fireworks-party-tour/\">this link to get yours ASAP as they are almost sold out</a>.</b></p> <p><b>Age Restriction 21+</b></p> <p>What you need <br/>Metro Card, Valid ID, Credit Card (Just for security return of headphones)</p> <p>How it works <br/>Arrive for registration and happy hour drinks. A valid Photo ID &amp; Credit Card will be needed. In the event you do not return the headphone, you will be charged an additional $50. With the headphones on, we’ll be traveling in the streets and subway. You can adjust the volume and choose between two master mixes with a flip of a switch. Each headset has a color LED that shows what you are listening to, so you can dance along with those listening to the same music as you. If you need to leave at any point, just hand your headphones into the organizer and you’ll receive your registration paper. We end at a bar in which the headphones are returned and you’re more than welcome to party till dawn.</p>",

Participants can mingle at the mega meet up on friday night before hunkering down for the hackathon. Awards will be given to outstanding projects as judged by a panel of seasoned veterans in the media and entertainment industry.</p> <p>The theme: Mythos and Moxie. While technology evolves at an accelerated rate, the fundamental tenets of story (Greek: \"mythos\") remain the same. Story transcends technology and strikes the human heart. It allows us to glimpse universal truths as well as leads us to self discovery. </p> <p>In the 2015 VR Hackathon, we encourage participants to probe VR with an eye on storytelling. We also support media creators with moxie - courage. Try things that have yet to be tried. In every project that fails, something is gained or learned.</p> <p>Awards will be given to outstanding VR as judged by a panel of seasoned professionals in media, entertainment and immersive technology.</p>",

      "description": "<p>You are invited to a film screening and discussion on Friday, July 10th as part of Responsible Endowments Coalition's (REC) Summer Film Series--an initiative to promote political education and community discussion around pressing and relevant issues.</p> <p>Co-sponsored by 350NYC, New York Society for Ethical Culture, and Bronx Climate Justice North, this event will feature “Disruption,\" a film by Kelly Nyks and Jared P. Scott. The movie explores the organizing work that led up to the People’s Climate March, the power of protest movements, and the issue of climate change through a social justice lens.</p> <p>The program will start at 6:30pm on the 4th Floor of the New York Society for Ethical Culture (2 W 64th Street, New York, NY 10023). After the movie, we will have presentations by student leaders working on university fossil fuel divestment campaigns as well as community activists working on the New York City pension divestment campaign. We will discuss takeaways from the movie, their implications on fossil fuel divestment campaigns, and next steps for intergenerational, cross-campaign collaboration.</p> <p>We hope to create an intimate, all-ages space that can provide networking opportunities for students, alumni, and community members in New York City. As movers, shakers, and doers with a shared vision of a sustainable and just world, we must come together to cultivate critical thought and proactively support each other’s efforts.</p> <p>Food and drinks will be provided. We highly encourage attendees to make a 5 dollar donation, but no one will be turned away for lack of funds. Please RSVP to our Facebook event and share the event with your friends!</p> <p>If you are unable to attend, you can watch out for future film screenings and new episodes in our ongoing political education video project.</p> <p>Thank you and we look forward to seeing you all there!<br/>Much love &amp; power,<br/>Nina Macapinlac<br/><a href=\"http://www.endowmentethics.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.endowmentethics.org/</a></p>",

The movie explores the organizing work that led up to the People’s Climate March, the power of protest movements, and the issue of climate change through a social justice lens. </p> <p>After the movie, we will have presentations by student leaders working on university fossil fuel divestment campaigns as well as community activists working on the New York City pension divestment campaign. We will discuss takeaways from the movie, their implications on fossil fuel divestment campaigns, and next steps for intergenerational, cross-campaign collaboration. </p> <p>We hope to create an intimate, all-ages space that can provide networking opportunities for students, alumni, and community members in New York City. As movers, shakers, and doers with a shared vision of a sustainable and just world, we must come together to cultivate critical thought and proactively support each other’s efforts.</p> <p>\n\n\nEntry to our 100-year-old building and meeting rooms is available for most wheelchair users with prior arrangements.

And don't take the RSVP too seriously - people are coming now who don't RSVP. The word is getting out....</p> <p>Everyone is invited! Dharma Drink is all about building community amongst the Buddhist and like minded crowd in New York City. Greg the founder of Dharma Drink: \"I was inspired to start Dharma Drink by hanging out with all of the great students of all of the different lamas in Kathmandu - Kagyu, Nyingma, Sakya, Gelugpa - totally Rimey (also Zen, Thai, Theravadan, yoga travelers, and the curious - just about everyone!).  We all became great friends and learned from each other.\" We're there every Friday night - see you there.</p> <p><br/>Motivation:  To make the Rubin Museum Lounge on Friday night the Buddhist and like minded hang-out spot in New York.</p> <p>Who:  ALL ARE INVITED.  Feel free to spread the word.  The more,             the merrier.</p> <p>Time:  7-?pm<br/>Date:  Every Friday - like clockwork<br/>Place:  Rubin Museum Lounge, 17th Street and 7th Avenue<br/>How to find us:  Look for a table with the small sign \"Dharma Drink\"                          + Lounge staff  will know where we are.</p> <p>Please see the following Meetups too!</p> <p>Buddhist Events New York     and</p> <p>Zen / Chan Buddhist Activities</p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.dharmadrink.com\">www.dharmadrink.com</a></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p> </p>",
      "why": "Because Buddhists and like minded people are great to hang-out with.",

      "description": "<p>We are reaching out to invite you to a film screening and discussion on Friday, July 10th as part of REC’s Summer Film Series--an initiative to promote political education and community discussion around pressing and relevant issues.</p> <p>Co-sponsored by 350NYC, New York Society for Ethical Culture, and Bronx Climate Justice North, this event will feature “Disruption,\" a film by Kelly Nyks and Jared P. Scott. The movie explores the organizing work that led up to the People’s Climate March, the power of protest movements, and the issue of climate change through a social justice lens.</p> <p>The program will start at 6:30pm on the 4th Floor of the New York Society for Ethical Culture (2 W 64th Street, New York, NY 10023). After the movie, we will have presentations by student leaders working on university fossil fuel divestment campaigns as well as community activists working on the New York City pension divestment campaign. We will discuss takeaways from the movie, their implications on fossil fuel divestment campaigns, and next steps for intergenerational, cross-campaign collaboration.</p> <p>We hope to create an intimate, all-ages space that can provide networking opportunities for students, alumni, and community members in New York City. As movers, shakers, and doers with a shared vision of a sustainable and just world, we must come together to cultivate critical thought and proactively support each other’s efforts.</p> <p>Food and drinks will be provided. We highly encourage attendees to make a 5 dollar donation, but no one will be turned away for lack of funds. Please RSVP to our Facebook event and share the event with your friends!</p> <p>If you are unable to attend, you can watch out for future film screenings and new episodes in our ongoing political education video project.</p> <p>Thank you and we look forward to seeing you all there!</p> <p>Much love &amp; power,<br/>Nina Macapinlac<br/><a href=\"http://www.endowmentethics.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.endowmentethics.org/</a><br/>-=-=-<br/>Responsible Endowments Coalition · United States</p>",

At that time, Ono advertised her “one woman show,” titled Museum of Modern [F]art. However, when visitors arrived at the Museum there was little evidence of her work. According to a sign outside the entrance, Ono had released flies on the Museum grounds, and the public was invited to track them as they dispersed across the city. Now, over 40 years later, Yoko Ono: One Woman Show, 1960–1971 surveys the decisive decade that led up to Ono’s unauthorized exhibition at MoMA, bringing together approximately 125 of her early objects, works on paper, installations, performances, audio recordings, and films, alongside rarely seen archival materials. A number of works invite interaction, including Painting to Be Stepped On (1960/1961) and Ono’s groundbreaking performance, Bag Piece (1964). The exhibition draws upon the 2008 acquisition of the Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection Gift, which added approximately 100 of Ono’s artworks and related ephemera to the Museum’s holdings.</p> <p>Join us for an evening of art and let's grab a drink afterwards :)</p> <p>See you there!</p>",

This is full- out, non-stop writing. Then we share- only if you want to- and do it again. We usually do this 2 times a meeting. It's a great way to get some words on the page. No prior reading or experience required to attend. You can leave early as we usually do this every half hour. Gotham Writer's Workshop charges $25 for this. Cost of this meetup? Free.</p> <p>Jessica</p> <p>&lt;a&gt;[masked]&lt;/a&gt;</p>",

My paintings describe these moments, the details of which are imparted in layers of paint. Most recently I've been thinking of the word Impermanence and what or how that idea can be embedded into my paintings. How are memories preserved and how do these recollections sometimes form confusing or false memories? After the actual experience of particularly very painful moments, our very existence relies often on changing and molding the memory into a more palatable or manageable one, something we can cope with better, understand and compartmentalize. I consider these recollections as layers of information, each level imparting bits of knowledge crucial to our consciousness, our ability to cope and even as a means of understanding our own mortality. This information and the concept of Impermanence comes to the surface and either sticks or fades away to different levels of opacity. Many times in remembering, I have personally buried the ugly and preserved the beautiful as a way of coping. I believe that I have created the same process in my art. When I am painting, the progression of remembering a specific moment over and over again from actually experiencing the event or sense from some unexplainable source helps structure the paintings. Some areas will be recognizable, while others will fade away into abstract thoughts of textures, forms, and colors. Other information I recall while I work has a deeper and unexplainable place that it comes from, call it intuition or instinct, these are all moments that I see as my truth unfolding onto a canvas. The surfaces of my paintings are very important to me. Color is also another significant element and is very specific to the actual memory. The process of scraping away layers of the oil paint and building them back up again is something that has added another level of information to consider in relationship to the act of painting and the concept of working from memories. Scarring or incising into the canvas, cutting, mending, adding found objects of antique thread and fabrics all contain a special meaning and relate to the preservation of my personal memories. ***</p> <p>Michelle Ghisson lives and works in Erie, PA. She was initially trained as a painter, earning her BFA, MA and her MFA from Edinboro University of Pennsylvania. Ghissons work is included in the permanent collection at Ednboro University of PA. She is currently working in her studio where she is using familial artifacts that she embeds into her work by layering items of antique threads and fabrics with oil paint that she mixes to a thick impasto and trowels on with various tool she makes herself. Recently Ghisson has begun to scar the canvas and mend with antique threads from her various family member. Her work is said to be, Breathtaking Trans-formative and Meaningful.</p>",

We want these meetings to be a place where you can talk about things that you enjoy. If you're interested in the infamous Kansai dialect, one of our members from that part of the country can teach you what it's all about. </p> <p>I heard from our member, some JAPANESE in other meetup always try to speak ENGLISH, then there are few chance to speak JAPANESE. So we try to speak JAPANESE as possible as we can for those who study JAPANESE seriously.</p> <p>Our purpose of this meetup is to teach Japanese and of course be fun,so fun, ultra fun !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </p> <p>See you soon!!</p> <p>ーーーーーーー PLEASE MAKE RSVP !!!! ーー ーーーーー      </p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/a/d/6/600_398216022.jpeg\" /></p> <p>【Please check our FACEBOOK page.

      "description": "<p>Join other single professionals for an early evening happy hour, topped off with about* 7-10 rounds of \"mini-dates.\" You'll meet each member of the opposite sex for 5-7 minutes each (depending on the size of the event - EXPECT TO MEET 7 TO 12 MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITE SEX*), turn in your dating card and then we'll send you the contact info of your mutual matches 48 hours later. On average, 80% of those who attend end up with at least one or two mutual matches.</p> <p>Get the full details below.</p> <p><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http://www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.</a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup. Therefore the number of RSVPs reflected here are NOT the total number of men or women registered.</i></p> <p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</b></p> <p><b>PAYMENT POLICY:<br/>$27- PAY IN ADVANCE ONLY - WE DO NOT ACCEPT PAYMENT AT DOOR</b></p> <p><b>REGISTER AND PAY HERE:</b> <a href=\"https://2015atwysspeeddatingnyc.eventbrite.com\"><a href=\"https://2015atwysspeeddatingnyc.eventbrite.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://2015atwysspeeddatingnyc.eventbrite.com</a></a></p> <p><b>(SEE MORE FAQ's BELOW)</b></p> <p><b>ABSOLUTELY NO REFUNDS FOR LAST MINUTE/DAY OF CANCELLATIONS</b></p> <p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</b></p> <p><b>FAST FACTS - PLEASE READ:</b></p> <p>*We can not accept payment at the door for these events. All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.</p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.</p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.</p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples/24 people. (See reason below)</p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*</p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.</p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.</p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.</p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.</p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.</p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:</b></p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?</p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.</p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.  Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.</p> <p><br/><b>FAQ'S</b></p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?</b></p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.</p> <p><b>What should I wear?</b></p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.</p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?</b></p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.</p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?</b></p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.</p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?</b></p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http://andthatswhyyouresingle.com/\">main events website</a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.</p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?</b></p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.</p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?</b></p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.</p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?</b></p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.</i></p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.</b></i></p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups. Please note that many people opt NOT to RSVP through Meetup for privacy reasons.</i></b></p>",

On average, 80% of those who attend end up with at least one or two mutual matches.</p> <p>Get the full details below.</p> <p><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http://www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.</a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup. Therefore the number of RSVPs reflected here are NOT the total number of men or women registered.</i></p> <p><br/><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</b></p> <p><b>PAYMENT POLICY:<br/>$27 - PAY IN ADVANCE ONLY - WE DO NOT ACCEPT PAYMENT AT DOOR</b></p> <p><b>REGISTER AND PAY HERE:</b> <a href=\"https://2015atwysspeeddatingnyc.eventbrite.com\"><a href=\"https://2015atwysspeeddatingnyc.eventbrite.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://2015atwysspeeddatingnyc.eventbrite.com</a></a></p> <p><b>(SEE MORE FAQ's BELOW)</b></p> <p><b>ABSOLUTELY NO REFUNDS FOR LAST MINUTE/DAY OF CANCELLATIONS<br/></b></p> <p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</b></p> <p><b>FAST FACTS - PLEASE READ:</b></p> <p>*We can not accept payment at the door for these events. All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.</p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.</p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.</p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples/24 people. (See reason below)</p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*</p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.</p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.</p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.</p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.</p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.</p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:</b></p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?</p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.</p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.  Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.</p> <p><br/><b>FAQ'S</b></p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?</b></p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.</p> <p><b>What should I wear?</b></p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.</p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?</b></p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.</p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?</b></p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.</p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?</b></p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http://andthatswhyyouresingle.com/\">main events website</a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.</p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?</b></p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.</p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?</b></p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.</p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?</b></p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.</i></p> <p>\n\n\n<i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.</b></i></p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups. Please note that many people opt NOT to RSVP through Meetup for privacy reasons.</i></b></p>",

      "description": "<p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>Our little group has grown to 935 members! Thanks to everyone! I'm excited to announce our next meetup, and I think it will be the best one yet. We'll be hanging out at Threes Brewing on Friday, July 10th starting at 7PM. This is an actual working brewery and bar, and although less than a year old, they're already making some of the best beer in NYC. They always have a bunch of their own beer on tap, and they fill their remaining lines with awesome craft beer. There might even be a surprise or two for us!</p> <p>Threes has been nice enough to offer group members an extended happy hour: we'll get $1 off every drink from 7-8PM. There's also a backyard if the weather is nice.</p> <p>A first for us, there will be great food too, so feel free to have dinner! Threes has been doing a 'rotating kitchen residency' since they opened, where food is cooked by some of the best restaurants in the city. So far they've had The Farm on Adderley, Insa Korean BBQ, Mimi's Hummus, Roberta's Pizza, The Sussman Brothers, Ruccola, Mile End, The Meat Hook, and Delaney BBQ. For us, Dover and Battersby, two great restaurntas in the Cobble Hill area, will be providing the food.</p> <p><br/>A quick note, this bar gets crowded, so it's best to arrive on the early side. Plus, more time to enjoy our discount!</p> <p><br/>Let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Hope to see all 935 of you there!</p> <p>\n\n\nEric</p>",

We are fortunate to live in a city where there is no shortage of cultural events during these warmer months. From the River to River Festival to Shakespeare in the Park to Electronic Daisy Carnival, there is something for everyone. One of our favorite seasonal events is Art After Dark at the internationally renowned art museum and one of the most significant architectural icons of the 20th century, the Guggenheim Museum. For those that have never been, imagine enjoying a cocktail then walking through the Guggenheim with hip-hop grooves playing in the background by DJ mOma. Sounds awesome, right? </p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/9/3/2/600_438947410.jpeg\" /></p> <p>So together with the Guggenheim, we are inviting our Startup Weekend community to not only skip the lines for After After Dark but also join us for happy hour inside their restaurant, The Wright. Get your exclusive discounted Guggenheim Membership and enjoy pre-event cocktails at the Wright with us. And once the doors open at 9PM, we can make our way directly into the museum for Art After Dark. </p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/9/6/4/600_438947460.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Take advantage of $10 savings and join us as our special guest for this after-hours private viewing of current exhibitions, including Storylines: Contemporary Art from the Guggenheim Collection and Doris Salcedo.

The Upper West Side has many architecturally distinctive and magnificent apartment buildings. We’ll discuss the architectural style and social history of some of these apartment buildings, built from 1880 to 1932. We’ll discuss apartment buildings that have had a scandalous past; others that have had a spiritual beginning. We’ll look at apartment houses built for the wealthy, tenements built for the poor, studio buildings built for artists, and buildings that were not originally built as apartment houses.</p> <p><b>This is a walking tour. We'll be walking about 2 1/2 miles. There will be a number of stops at points of interest. If you don't like a lot of stopping, then this type of walk is not good for you.</b></p> <p>Although the Ansonia is still decorated with magnificent ornamentation, it originally had even more ornamentation. During 1942, the Ansonia’s copper cornices were removed and melted down for the war effort. <i>(Photo Library of Congress [Detroit Publishing Company </i>circa 1905<i>])</i></p> <p><b><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/8/1/600_435316257.jpeg\" /></b></p> <p>Workmen removing a cartouche from the roof of the Ansonia Hotel. <i>(Source Lorraine B.

However, we are going to take up the banner this year. Join us starting with the second Friday.</p> <p><br/>Someone will be at the location around 7:30. The fast will open at around 8:32 pm. As usual, we'll have a communal prayer followed by food. We request a $5-10 donation towards the cost of hosting the iftaars. All excess funds collected will be donated to charity. Typically, community members choose to sponsor part or all of the iftaars. If you are interested, please contact any of the organizers via email.</p> <p>Please note that we do have limited space, so please RSVP only if you plan to attend. We do not charge a deposit for attendance, so it's really important, especially for iftaars that require pre-planning, that if you change your mind or something comes up, that you change your attendance on the site, to allow for others to take your place.</p>",

This event Friday night is for men and women at Nirvana.</p> <p>At present we need both men and women aged 33 to 43 although there's a little flexibility in the age range.

This promises to be a lot of fun, so you're highly encouraged to come down. To get your spot, you must:</p> <p>(a) RSVP on the MeetUp site</p> <p>(b) please also e-mail me directly at</p> <p>&lt;a&gt;[masked]&lt;/a&gt; to say you want to come and kindly give your age and first name.</p> <p>As this is a speed-dating event, and the balance of men and women is very important, I will need to correspond with you briefly by e-mail to confirm your attendance.  Please note that you are only confirmed once you get a reply from me (i.e. from &lt;a&gt;[masked]&lt;/a&gt;).  But if you're looking for more details about this event, please visit the New York EasyDates website (you also can signup there anytime in case I don't respond back with promo code MEETUP20).

Someone will be at the location around 7:30. </p> <p>The fast will open at around 8:30 pm. As usual, we'll have a communal prayer followed by food. We request a $5-10 donation towards the cost of hosting the iftaars. All excess funds collected will be donated to charity. Typically, community members choose to sponsor part or all of the iftaars. If you are interested, please contact any of the organizers via email. </p> <p><br/>Please note that we do have limited space, so please RSVP by Wednesday at Noon if you plan to attend so that we can order an appropriate amount of food. We do not charge a deposit for attendance, so it's really important, especially for iftaars that require pre-planning, that if you change your mind or something comes up, that you change your attendance on the site, to allow for others to take your place.</p>",

It brings the candle which never gets burn and shines in your life always!<br/>Through the Dance i learned how to love unconditionally and have compassion towards all living beings. How to live in my heart and in my spirit!</p> <p>Dance is more than we think it is. It is simply a meditation where you move from your head to your body and spirit and leave everything behind, let go who we think we are, and embracing your true self! You wanna climb on the mountain?<br/>Climb, while you dance.<br/>You wanna Fight with your obstacles?<br/>Fight with a dance.<br/>Dance at the edge of the abyss.<br/>Dance your sadness,<br/>Dance your pain,<br/>Dance your cry,<br/>Dance your fear!<br/>Allow yourself to feel curious to feel sadness to feel pain to feel everything that comes to you. Allow yourself to be loud, to scream, to laugh... Allow all of ur qualities good or bad.... Embrace them, and let go the things you need to let go,<br/>Let yourself feel free! And Just Dance.......Let your spirit Dance.<br/>Feel the lightness, weightiness when you Dance.<br/>Express yourself fully, Leave All the stories you created about yourself behind...<br/>Now go deep down to your soul....<br/>And tell your true story by your spiri</p>",

      "description": "<p>    Hi all, this is comment I put on a discussion of Greece.   I'll ad more to what may be the digital currency implications. </p> <p> ----------------- comment  </p> <p> I think Greece will go. I think they should go.  Some economist have it that in the short term Greece will have it bad, but in the long term it will become better. Most hear, how bad it be, but they don't say it becomes better. It's because you hit rock bottom, only place is to go is up.  If you keep the debt, you languish on the lower tear -- not all the way to the bottom, but much lower than the middle.   People who filed bankruptcy, have more money after freeing up from debt payments.     </p> <p>  But, for EU it will look real bad, there are I think 3 or 4 other EU nations that have debt problems.  If their government change and votes to renegotiate their debt, it becomes a domino effect to unravel everything.   EU bonds will suffer before that happens and after if Greece leaves, but they wonder who will be next.  Euro will drop in value.  To keep it from falling, ECB will have to raise interest rates. If they do that, it will slow down what economic grow they had. In fact it will worsen the poorer EU nations economic condition because it will slow down their economy even worse.  Then for USA, because euro is worth less, they can't sell as much to Europe.  Therefore what little economic recovery USA had will go down the drain.  Europe is their 2nd best trade partner. The question will be then, will the USA open their balance sheet of US treasury bonds to print more money so they can lower the value of their currency so they can trade with EU competitively.  If that happens, Japan will have to do same. So on and so on -- nations around the globe will do the same.  The domino effects will keep on going, where it stops, will someone know, except for God, almighty.           </p> <p>  So although Greece GDP may be small, this tiny rock can turn into a boulder quickly and who is going to stop it?</p> <p>------------------- End of comment -------------</p> <p>                  Ok,  this currency balancing and unbalancing may have no end, once the Greece bomb hits.  The moving and maneuvering  of currency of different country will have no end.  For some will start looking for stabling factors.  That is the key to business -- steady and stable.  In this equation the problem is the many parts will keep changing their currency. What you need is a commonality where most will use, so that the abundant use of one currency or what most currency is backed by will not keep changing.  In my opinion, they will need to back up their currency to a commonality that all can or most can agree on.  Usually business people sticks to what is stable.   Interesting enough, that's where gold came in handy back then.  It was not that gold was used for money, but most nations accepted it and agreed on it.   </p> <p>                  So this will give an opening for digital currency, or for that matter anything that may be stable, if this really does become \"Currency Apocalypse\".   They may grab for bitcoins.  So far, it has been steady at 200 -300 most of the year.    </p> <p>                 On a side track there is the oil effect with the USA.  Saudis can't sell oil to China, because China and Russia will only trade in currency that is not US dollars.  This loses business for Saudis since they agreed with USA to trade only in dollars.   That is important because if the Saudis do decide to trade in other currencies, which I believe they'll do because USA oil producers are competing with them,  the USA dollar may drop because of lose of demand.    But by how much?  Do you know, according to Forbes,  the US fed have already bought trillions of US bonds and it is in their balance sheet, for economic recovery.  How will they sell off these bonds without higher interest rates to make them more attractive?  The world won't want US dollars as much, if they can buy oil with other currencies.  You add China's AIIB, BRICS, incentives to use  non-US currency to do global transaction, the US dollar demand may plummet even more. </p> <p>There are so many factors in today's currencies that many may not be able to predict what will happen.  Most should agree, it is an unprecedented times we are living in. </p>",

      "description": "<p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/0/4/4/600_121956932.jpeg\" /></p> <p>This summer, we would like to try to host some late night photowalks and execute some long exposures.  Weather permitting, we will meet on the side of the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory.  Nearest subways are York Street (F), Clark Street (2,3) and High Street (A,C).</p> <p>We will begin by capturing some long exposures of the cityscape from Brooklyn Bridge Park for about an hour.  Then we will cross the Brooklyn Bridge and make a pit stop at City Hall.  We'll head towards South Street Seaport for some long exposures at the pier for about 20-30 minutes.  Then we will continue our walk along South Street; maybe stop by Wall Street for some architecture, and our last stop will be at the National Museum of the American Indian -- by the Bowling Green subway station.</p> <p>***********************************</p> <p>Items to bring: </p> <p> <br/>* Camera -- along with charged battery and empty memory card </p> <p> <br/><b>* Tripod -- PLEASE READ THIS; IMPORTANT!!!! --  We've done long exposures in the past and so far we had no issues. Just bringing up the possibilities so that everyone is aware -- Tripods ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE USED on the bridge.  If you have a monopod, or a mini tripod, you could probably use those.  Keep in mind that the bridge may still be quite crowded with tourists, joggers and cyclists, so stay on the correct path of the bridge. Also, you may be stopped by police or security for using a tripod &amp; be asked for a permit.  Just move along.    So, you have been warned.</b> </p> <p> <br/>* Remote -- this is OPTIONAL.  If you want to shoot longer than 30 seconds aka bulb mode, a remote is a good idea. </p> <p> <br/>* Bring snacks &amp; water to stay hydrated.</p> <p>***********************************</p> <p>* Be on time! This event starts at 9pm sharp!! So give yourself plenty of time to travel. Check for service changes or delays. I will not wait for latecomers and I will not answer calls, emails and/or messages after 9pm.</p> <p>* Dress appropriately for the weather and wear comfortable shoes.</p> <p>* Food and restrooms are located in the Brooklyn Bridge Park area if you want to arrive earlier to eat and drink.  After that, you gonna have to hold it... :P</p> <p><b>* DO NOT WANDER OFF IN THE DARK BY YOURSELF WITH YOUR EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT!!!  YOU'LL JUST BE ASKING SOMEONE TO HURT YOU AND STEAL FROM YOU.  ALWAYS WALK WITH SOMEONE OR A SMALL GROUP!!!!</b></p> <p>Details of this event may be added or changed at any time, so please check in periodically on this page.</p> <p>If you have any questions, text me before the day of the event.

      "description": "<p>Whether you are visiting our beautiful city, coming from a lesson, or just have the day off...come on out and hit with us! We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.</p> <p><br/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?</b></p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...</p> <p><br/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be  prepaid just to keep the group alive.</p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.</p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.</p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.</p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.</p> <p><a

Ridgewood Ave. and Oak St.  Ridgewood Coffee Company is right up the street from where we usually start when we start at the Duck Pond.  There are benches outside if you feel like sitting down and there's coffee inside if you're sleepy.  The route is flexible depending on who shows up.   The route will be mostly on sidewalks.</p> <p>Please bring dimes and/or quarters to park at the meters in Ridgewood.  You can park a little further away from Ridgewood Coffee Company to avoid the meters.</p> <p>We are going to run this 5 mile route courtesy of Gary:</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/5/c/4/600_416666052.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Thanks Gary.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Not Suitable for beginners or slow hikers. Let’s have some fun and celebrate leader’s 53rnd birthday by doing leader‘s favorite activity this Sat. by going hiking. The hike will be 10 miles long depending on temperature and the leader’s energy level. This hike will be a typical Tuxedo hike with the usual assortment of hills, lakes, valleys, woods roads, etc. This hike won’t be run at a fast pace, but won’t be slow either. It will be at a moderate pace, and we will stop as needed. It could be a demanding hike for some. We will stop a reasonable number of times. If you are looking for a high intensity workout this is the wrong hike. Leader determines the pace, mileage number of stops, and duration of stops. If you want to run, do not come. Bring at least 3 quarts of water your lunch and wear hiking boots. If all goes well we will take the RD to the BD, the BD to the K, the K to the WB, the WB to the T, the T to the RD, and the RD to the parking lot. Rain cancels. No swimming and no dogs. Trans. 1C Tuxedo Orange CO. Bus Riders are always welcome. There is no need to let me know you are coming by bus. , but if you have any questions about the hike feel free to call or e-mail me. Bus riders take the 8:30 Short Line bus from PABT NY which Arr. 9:19.Buy a one way bus ticket. The short line ticket office is on the second floor of the North Building of the PABT. The bus usually leaves from gate 813. Drivers meet in in the commuter parking lot just passed the RR tracks on East Village road. . L: Joe Nigro[masked] (7:30-9:30 PM) [masked]</p>",

      "description": "<p>Now you can take a live Insanity class outdoors, at Clove Lakes Park by Certified Insanity Fitness Instructor, Marie-Elena Aruta. Bring a guest your first visit and your first class is 1/2 off.<br/>This revolutionary cardio-based total-body conditioning program is based on the principles of MAX interval training. INSANITY pushes the participants to new training heights, resulting in more calories burned, faster results and more efficient metabolism. This interval training is the pinnacle of cardio training. You don't have to be in extreme shape - levels of each exercise are provided.<br/>Insanity's not your traditional interval workout. It replaces traditional moderate-intensity exercise with maximum-intensity exercise, and trades short intervals of intensity for short periods of rest. The secret? Long periods of explosive intensity. You’ll do cardio and plyometric drills with intervals of strength, power, resistance, and core training. With Insanity, you can burn up to 1,000 calories in an hour. Participants experience faster increases in cardiovascular fitness and burn carbohydrates and fat more efficiently.</p> <p>Class Description:<br/>PLYOMETRICS for insane legs and gluts, UPPER BODY RESISTANCE for sculpted arms, shoulders, chest, and back. PURE CARDIO for crazy fat burn and CARDIO ABS with intensive core work so you can get awesome abs. 50 minutes: All Levels Welcome!<br/>☆☆☆$10.00 for a limited time only☆☆☆</p>",

      "description": "<p>We do our summer runs in the morning, because it works better for the school, and it's also cooler in the AMs. Plus, you get to start your day off right! :)</p> <p>Welcome!</p> <p><br/>If you love to play basketball, but height is not your advantage, come out and play with people who aren't excessively tall! In the tradition of Spud Webb, anyone under 5'8\", male or female, is welcome to join us on the court. We'll get some teams together and play some competitive, but relaxed bball-- and without any giant hands in our faces! :-p</p> <p>We rent out the gym from 10:00am to 1:00pm. Please arrive at least 5-10 minutes early as the sooner everyone arrives, the sooner we can begin playing. Note that all games stop at 12:45pm as we have to be out of the gym by 1:00pm. (If you get there late, please only ring the bell once. It is very loud! And it takes us a few minutes to get downstairs.) The gym is on the 10th fl. &amp; has adjoining bathrooms, lockers, and water fountains.</p> <p>We'll hit up McSwiggans (393 2nd Avenue @ 23rd St) later! Don't forget:</p> <p>* You must be no more than 5'8\" to play!</p> <p>* You must RSVP on the site in order to attend!</p> <p>* You will be asked to sign a waiver for 2014 as we're not a litigious group. If you have any problems with the prepay, just shoot one of the organizers an email.</p> <p>Here are the basic rules we follow for games: 1. Play by ones and twos to 11 - win by one point.</p> <p>2. Make it - take it.</p> <p>3. Backcourt if the ball hits the rim or backboard. Air balls are fair game to put right back up.</p> <p>4. Jump balls/disputed calls will be determined by a three pointer since the laws of basketball physics are very clear that \"the ball never lies.\"</p> <p>5. Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds. 6. Subs will enter the game no later than 6 points in (once one of the teams reaches 6 points). The sub will start the following game. Teams will regulate themselves but let's make sure everyone plays.</p> <p>See you on the court! B-)</p> <p>***NOTE***</p> <p>In an effort for us to reduce overcrowding and to maintain a more accurate estimate of how many people to expect, please sign up online if you intend to play. There is a waiting list if all spots have been taken. We ask that you please just do not show up unannounced as you will kindly be asked to turned away. Also feel free to bring your own basketball for shoot-around. And don't forget to clip your nails prior to game day. We tried playing with Edward Scissorhands once - it didn't turn out so well.</p>",

To survive involved an innate understanding that the Earth is an intelligent, living being and complex system - of which humans are only a small part.  Over millennia, we have lost this understanding and isolated ourselves from the lessons of the Earth.  To regain this lost knowledge we must once again “touch the Wild Edges” and become comfortable with uncertainty and Chaos while living in order.</p> <p><br/>Join us for a journey of Self-Discovery using ancient Irish Fomorian stories to learn:</p> <p>~Celtic Shamanism through a Celtic/Druidic view of the World </p> <p>~Techniques on how to remain balanced and whole</p> <p>~How to ‘Dance with the Dark’ w/out being overwhelmed or seduced by it</p> <p>~How to retain an interconnectedness and interdependence with all living things</p> <p>~And much more </p> <p><br/>Jim Wood is a graduate of the Foundation for Shamanic Studies' training programs in numerous Shamanism and Shamanic Healing courses as well as a graduate of Sandra Ingerman's Shamanic Teacher Training. He has studied Celtic Shamanism extensively with Tom Cowan and co-facilitates Shamanic Workshops and Gatherings with Tom. He is a Trained Shamanic Practitioner and Shamanic Counselor and an Ordained Druid in the Fellowship of Druids of the Later Age (FoDLA). He is also a student and dabbler in Herbalism and Alchemy.</p> <p><br/>Jim has a private Shamanic healing practice in New York’s Hudson Valley consisting of all aspects of Shamanic Healing including Soul Retrieval, Extraction, Depossession, Power Animal Retrieval and Psycho-pomp work and is the founder of the FoDLA Grove of the Greenwood.  Jim also teaches Shamanic Journeying, Celtic Shamanism and Soul Retrieval workshops and facilitates several Shamanic Drumming Circles.  He can be reached via</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.CelticWisdom.com\">www.CelticWisdom.com</a></p> <p>\n\n\nRSVP here: <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&amp;SESSION=Z6eLFDOa8mU7UUUT23jsQJIJKJC1DkDCpd7k7GSzKDTqdzIZ2Oi4wdwIv94&amp;dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8de6030e9239419d79c3f52f70a3ed57ec\"><a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&amp;SESSION=Z6eLFDOa8mU7UUUT23jsQJIJKJC1DkDCpd7k7GSzKDTqdzIZ2Oi4wdwIv94&amp;dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8de6030e9239419d79c3f52f70a3ed57ec\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&amp;SESSION=Z6eLFDOa8mU7UUUT23jsQJIJKJC1DkDCpd7k7GSzKDTqdzIZ2Oi4wdwIv94&amp;dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8de6030e9239419d79c3f52f70a3ed57ec</a></a></p> <p><br/>More Info contact Cristina Maria via email address:</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]</a> or phone: &lt;a&gt;[masked]&lt;/a&gt;</p>",

The Audubon Terrace area was once the home of painter and naturalist John James Audubon and now is occupied by Manhattan’s only active cemetery (Trinity Church Cemetery). You will be surprised to learn of some of the people buried here. We'll also visit the magnificent Church of the Intercession and Hispanic Society of America, one of New York’s most unique free museums with an extraordinary collection of art and artifacts from Spain, Portugal and Latin America.  Further uptown we’ll also visit the delightful Morris Jumel Mansion, Manhattan’s oldest house built in 1765 which once served as General George Washington’s headquarters in 1776 and where in 1790 as President he dined with members of his cabinet:  Thomas Jefferson, John Adams and Alexander Hamilton.  You will scarcely believe that you are in Manhattan while strolling these quiet streets that surround the mansion.  Rounding out the tour will be a stop at the Malcolm X Memorial and for baseball fans we will traverse the site where the Yankees began as the New York Highlanders.  Optional brunch/ lunch after the tour at Coogan’s Restaurant on Broadway.</p> <p><i>Note:  In addition the Jumel Mansion has a modest admission admission charge: of $3 - $5 dollars</i></p> <p><br/>Meeting Place: Small triangle park (Ilka Tanya Pagan Park), located on the Westside of Broadway near the 157th Street.  The #1 subway gets you right there. <i>Note you can also take the A train to 168th Street either walk, ride Broadway bus or take the #1 downtown one stop.</i></p>",

      "description": "<p>Whether you are visiting our beautiful city, coming from a lesson, or just have the day off...come on out and hit with us! We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.</p> <p><br/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?</b></p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...</p> <p><br/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be  prepaid just to keep the group alive.</p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.</p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.</p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.</p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.</p> <p><a

After all, I grew up in rural Vermont and already loved the outdoors.  I learned through the practice of Shinrin-Yoku and I'd love to show you what it's all about.  If you aren't familiar, please check out <a href=\"http://aplus.com/a/a-walk-in-the-woods-for-health-and-healing?so=PiKbkZ8thcm8L47SnMRv6d&amp;ref=ns\">this recent article</a> on the practice and its benefits.  The author also speaks of the Association where I got my training.</p> <p>The walk will be in a beautiful part of the park called the Loch: a forested area with towering oaks with a stream and cascading waterfall.  I'll invite you to partake in a series of sensory activities along the way and we'll all share in that experience together.  Returning Nature Connectors welcome!  Every walk is different and unique.</p> <p>There is a $10 suggested donation that, if you are pleased and willing, you can give me at the end of the walk.  </p> <p>There is a limit of 12 people on this one so when you sign up you're in!  Please be on time as I power down my device at the top of the meetup.  I can't accommodate folks who want to join in midway through as it's best if we are all present from the top.  Here is my cell [masked]) if you're lost or running late- or message me here if you have any questions.</p> <p>I'll see you all soon!  Until then try to spend some quality time (2-3 hours) with nature every week.  It can be a challenge here in the city but you can do it- Heck, you probably already are:)  </p> <p>DUNCAN</p>",

Here is the basic mileage and trip outline:</p> <p>Day 1:</p> <p>Port Authority Shortline Bus #781 8:45 AM arriving at Bear Mountain 10:15</p> <p>S-BM trail head to Big Hill Shelter: 12.25 miles</p> <p>Day 2:</p> <p>Big Hill Shelter to Trail End: 11.15 miles</p> <p>Suffern Train Station is .4 miles from Trail End, and the bus stop is on the way to the train.</p> <p>Suffern train leaves for Penn Station every hour on the 8s (exception is 4:32). Bus leaves at 2:38, 4:00, 5:00 for Port Authority.</p> <p>****I am NOT a wilderness expert or an official guide. You need to be self sufficient to join this hike. There will be no sweep group and we will move at our own paces. I'm the kind of hiker that likes to get to the destination and then hang/relax as opposed to stopping constantly along the way. Feel free to do the mileage as you like and I'll see you at camp if we're not close together on the trail.</p> <p>Who: Intermediate backpackers. We'll be doing 11+ miles a day so be fit and ready to put in some mileage. Backpacking is 3X harder than day hiking.</p> <p>Gear (this is NOT an all encompassing list):<br/>Tent (or other appropriate shelter - the Lean to could be full), hiking boots, backpack, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, appropriate clothing for day and night, rain/wind gear, headlamp, food dish and utensil (1 breakfast, 2 lunches and 1 dinner), snacks, stove/fuel/pot, water filters/chemical treatment, insect repellent, sunscreen, 1st aid kit, water bladders/nalgene bottles, start with 3L+ of water, bear bag and rope.</p> <p>You MUST also bring both PAPER Harriman Maps 118/119. Do not solely rely on the Avenza APP for this.</p> <p>***I will post more info if I think of anything else important. This is my first time organizing an event, so bear with me :)</p> <p>***If the weather forecast the day or two before promises downpours, record heat or some other craziness, I will cancel.</p>",

I will post cancellations here by 9am on the day.</p> <p><br/>To find us, enter the park via the entrance opposite the Ethical Culture School (The Ethical Culture School is on the west side of Central Park West) at 63rd and Central Park West.  The \"Backup Fencing Spot\" is on your right, just inside the entrance to the park.  Soccer kids have been grabbing our \"Where We Fence\" location pretty steadily, but to find it, follow the paved path in a large arc to your left, (It starts off heading SE and curves around to NW).  The \"Where We Fence\" location is on the hard packed dirt under the trees. </p> <p><br/>We have a very limited amount of equipment to lend.

The title of the cycle refers to the muscle that raises and lowers the male reproductive system according to external stimuli such as temperature or fear. Taken in sequential order, the films correlate to the height of the gonads during the embryonic process of sexual differentiation, with CREMASTER 1 representing the most “ascended” state, and CREMASTER 5 the most “descended.”</p> <p>As the cycle evolved over eight years (1994–2002), this biological model was joined by other paradigms such as history, autobiography and mythology that have added to Barney’s fantastical narrative constructs. The resulting cosmology is both beautiful and complex, with densely layered and interconnected symbols and images.</p> <p>The films are screened here in chronological order of their production to reveal the development of Barney’s relationship to the material and of his creative process.</p> <p><b>Schedule</b><br/>10:30 am, CREMASTER 4 (1994), 41 min.<br/>11:15 am, CREMASTER 1 (1995), 42 min.<br/>12:15 pm, CREMASTER 5 (1997), 55 min.<br/>2:45 pm, CREMASTER 2 (1999), 80 min.<br/>4:30 pm, CREMASTER 3 (2002), 178 min.</p> <p>Free with museum admission.</p> <p>For detailed info on the series follow these links<br/><a href=\"http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/calendar-and-events/2015/06/06/the-cremaster-cycle/4787\"><a href=\"http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/calendar-and-events/2015/06/06/the-cremaster-cycle/4787\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/calendar-and-events/2015/06/06/the-cremaster-cycle/4787</a></a><br/><a href=\"http://www.cremaster.net/\"><a href=\"http://www.cremaster.net/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.cremaster.net/</a></a></p> <p>For admission hours and location follow this link<a href=\"http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/visit\"> <a href=\"http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/visit\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/visit</a></a></p>",

We perform high-intensity body-weight exercises to build strength, flexibility and stamina. We also use equipment such as jump ropes, kettlebells and agility ladders.

As such, we provide effective modifications for all activities based on individual need and ability. The challenging, unique workouts are never stale. We will help you get LEAN AND MEAN in 2015!</p> <p>Pay whatever you want. Most members pay about $10 per workout. </p>",

That’s how our worrying can cause physical symptoms as if we were in a threatening environment, but also how guided imagery can cause physical symptoms of relaxation as if we were lounging beachside in Bali.</p> <p>Learn how to harness power of your mind and imagination to give your mind a rest. When the mind is experiencing relaxation, pleasure, or stillness - even for just 10 minutes - the body responds accordingly. </p> <p>At this Meetup, we'll connect and talk about the topic via informal group discussion, then experience a full Guided Imagery, followed by Q&amp;A, connecting with other like-minded women, warm tea, and light refreshments (aka chocolate.)</p> <p><i>What to expect:</i></p> <p><i>All of Enodia Center’s sessions, Studio Series, and community events are designed to be realistic for every woman. You don’t have to alter your beliefs, lifestyle, or wardrobe to experience all the benefits of our Studio Series. Therefore, this is a totally \"come as you are\" Meetup. The only request we have is that you remove your shoes, so comfy socks are always a plus!  </i></p> <p><i>As always, don't hesitate to contact me at [masked] with any questions. Looking forward to connecting with you!</i></p> <p><br/><i><br/></i></p> <p><i>**Please note, all payments must be received at least 2 days prior to the event, otherwise your space will be released to another Meetup member.

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.</p> <p>We'll play 3 simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with goals. There will be 6 teams on the field and we will play three games, 30 minutes/game. Every 30 minutes we will have a short break and teams will switch to play against different team. Please check your email or our meetup message board on friday night or before 12.00pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.</p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:</b></p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.</p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.</p> <p>If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.</p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.</p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.</p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer/s!!!</p> <p><b>Location:</b></p> <p>Riverside Park at West 107 &amp; 108 Street</p> <p>Take the 1 RED Line Train to Cathedral Pkwy an walk two blocks down, to 108th Street and Riverside Dr.</p> <p>The field is down the lower level near the river. You can easly access the field from 108th Street. Remember, the field is not visable from the street level, you have to walk down the stairs from Riverside Dr &amp; 108th Street. and you will see the newly renovated fanced-in soccer field next to the river.</p> <p>Call me if you can’t find the field - [masked] Manny S.</p> <p><br/><b>What to bring with you:</b></p> <p>A pair of sneakers, indoor or turf shoes, shin guards (recommended) and lots of water. There is a water fountain next to the park if you need extra water.</p> <p><b>Fee:</b></p> <p>You will be asked to pay $9.25 when you RSVP. This $9.25 is used to pay for, facilities permits, meetup fees, Amazon fees, goals, cones, soccer balls etc.</p> <p><b>Refunds &amp; Weather Policy:</b></p> <p>Refunds will be issued if the RSVP is changed by Wednesday before 12.00PM or if the game is cancelled.

I have never really tired of returning to them.</p> <p>Join us for a discussion of how Einstein arrived at his theory from first principles.  We will talk about the relativity of simultaneity, how velocities add in a relativistic framework, introduce Minkowski space and derive the Lorentz transformation between different inertial frames of reference.  There will be some math involved, but not too heavy....vector and matrix multiplication is about all that we will need.</p> <p>This is really a 2 parter, so we will go as far as time (in our meet-up frame of reference!) allows and then pick up next time.</p> <p>\n\n\nSome good sources....</p> <p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_special_relativity\"><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_special_relativity\" class=\"linkified\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_special_relativity</a></a></p> <p><br/>Susskind's lectures ( which I think is a great starting point)...the first of which is here...</p> <p><a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=toGH5BdgRZ4\"><a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=toGH5BdgRZ4\" class=\"linkified\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=toGH5BdgRZ4</a></a> </p> <p><br/>For the more adventurous...or, for those with more time on their hands</p> <p><a href=\"http://cosmo.nyu.edu/hogg/sr/sr.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://cosmo.nyu.edu/hogg/sr/sr.pdf</a></p>",
