We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6.

For the time that the event runs, I will be available to discuss a pre-chosen topic with you one on one and with whomever is in the group that evening.<\/p> <p>This month we're going to have two. The first is on meditation and is held on the 9th. This is the second event the next night on the 10th. These events are very informal and consist of participants sitting together, having the space to share experiences and ask questions, and of course drinking tea, graciously provided by the Emporium.<\/p> <p>This event is not a formal presentation, but I will be bringing many of my tools and work from the Andes to the event. You can pet a baby llama, see an alter piece, hold tools made by shamans in the jungle, take a look at photos, hold the leaves from a sacred plant and touch the feathers of the condor. I will also be talking about the things I've learned in the temples and sacred sites in Peru and Bolivia, including Coricancha, Saqsayhuaman, Machu Pichu, Ollantaytambo, Wiracocha, Tiahuanaco, Puma Punko, the Sacred Valley and the valley of Tinanjani. I will also be sharing my personal experiences with the healing of the Andean teachings, Coca leaf work, and Wachuma.<\/p> <p>I met my second teacher in the Andean tradition for this work and he has authorized me to speak to you on these topics. His name is Jhaimy and you can contact him here if you wish to verify this information: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/jhaimy.alvarezacosta?fref=ts\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/jhaimy.alvarezacosta?fref=ts<\/a><\/p> <p>I will share with you everything I can (because I love you!). My other qualifications in medicine ways don't matter, but if you're curious ask and I'll answer.<\/p> <p>This event is being offered without charge in the interest of building a healthy community, but if you'd like to support my work and the shop, donations of $5 are happily accepted and are split between the two hosts.<\/p>",

This style of antenna is highly directional and can shoot signal for hundreds of feet! If you want to connect two points far away from each other without spending an arm and a leg, this is the way to do it! These antennas will be specifically tuned for 2.4GHz. Similar antenna designs have been calculated to increase gain by 11dbi.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Our Instructor<\/b><\/p> <p>Drew from Zhrodague is a 300-foot tall fire-breathing sysadmin, living at the top of the South Side Slopes. He is an amateur radio enthusiast who has built his own antennas for use in the 40 meter and 160 meter bands. Drew has\u00a0contributed to O'Reilly books such as \"Google Map Hacks\" and has also taught other classes on building omnidirectional antennas for the 2.4 GHz band at Hack Pittsburgh.\u00a0He\u2019s worked with dorkbot, PittMesh, and with a few other local groups. When not toppling buildings, Drew works on many projects, including HAM radio, mesh networking, GIS systems, and recycled embedded computing projects.<\/p>",

We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5.

This meetup, done with the flair of quantum physics as a guide, will dive deep into the text and process its soul-inspiring concepts, encouraging all participants to walk their pathway toward Truth. (Note: this is a heavily spiritual group with a strong emphasis on the presence of God in all of our lives ... we will use science as support for the concepts in the course, but the focus is primarily spiritual.)<\/p>",

And thanks to concepts discussed in earlier levels, it also means that YOU are the director and scriptwriter and the actor\/actress and the key grip (we'll explain that one later) of this movie.

Two houses. One stage. Similar to PICT\u2019s 2011 production of <i>\"House and Garden\" <\/i>(also by Alan Aykbourn),<i> <b>\"How the Other Half Loves<\/b><\/i>\" is a classic farce by the genius of English theatre. With all the complexities and confusions that every great comedy offers, we have a mixture of saints and sinners in a series of nefarious relationships. Experience humor at its finest as two dinner parties on different nights occur simultaneously, while all along the audience knows the secret that is causing the commotion.<\/p> <p>Pittsburgh audiences have also seen many other plays by Alan Aykbourn, such as <i>\"Time of My Life\"<\/i> (Pittsburgh Public Theater, 2010) and <i>\"RolePlay\" <\/i>(Pittsburgh Public Theater, 2005)<\/p> <p><br\/>Check out these nice articles and great reviews of <i><b>\"How the Other Half Loves\"<\/b><\/i> which are conveniently embedded within this link along with cast info, photos, video insights about the play, ticket availability, etc. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.picttheatre.org\/play\/half-loves\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.picttheatre.org\/play\/half-loves\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.picttheatre.org\/play\/half-loves\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>Meetup Discount Tickets<\/b><\/p> <p>To purchase discount tickets for the Friday June 12 performance with the online MEETUP30 discount code, please visit <a href=\"https:\/\/picttheatre.secure.force.com\/ticket\/#details_a0SU[masked]ZogMAE\"><a href=\"https:\/\/picttheatre.secure.force.com\/ticket\/#details_a0SU[masked]ZogMAE\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/picttheatre.secure.force.com\/ticket\/#details_a0SU[masked]ZogMAE<\/a><\/a> where you can also select your own seat.<\/p> <p>Please note that the Meetup discount is $36 for advanced tickets ($30 + $6 handling) which is a nice savings as compared to the normal $54 price ($48\u00a0+ $6 handling).<\/p> <p>As always, it is also fine if you wish to attend the play (and get the discount) with family\/friends instead.<\/p> <p><b>Other Discount Options<\/b> -- The Saturday evening\u00a08 PM June 13 performance has a similar discount\u00a0that is\u00a0offered through the Goldstar discount ticketing company where people can get\u00a050% off advance tickets plus $6.25 handling fee (per ticket) which equates to about\u00a0$33 per ticket.

There is a small fee per person ($5) to attend Games Day, to cover the cost of the rental hall. This fee is waived for all first-time attendees. The fee will be collected when you arrive, and will grant access to all the games contributed by our members, for use that day. We will be holding off taking any new yearly payments, but those that did pay will be honored.<\/p> <p>Speaking of games, there are always a multitude of board, card, role-playing, and miniature games being played on any given Game Day, but a few events are near constants.\u00a0<br\/>Our Multi-Player Magic League runs each Game Day, starting around 11am. It\u2019s a league that runs Jan-Oct. There is a second league starting at 4:30PM with modified rules and decks, please read the forum post for more information.\u00a0<br\/>Several RPG campaigns are also run each Game Day, including our \"One-Shot Saturdays\", stand-alone adventures run by various GMs each month.\u00a0<br\/>There are several miniature games that regularly appear at each Game Day. These vary each month, but some examples are X-Wing, Lord of the Rings, Firestorm Armada, Dystopian Wars, Axis and Allies: War at Sea &amp; Angels 20, BattleTech, AT-43, Infinity, and others.\u00a0<br\/>Don\u2019t forget our extensive board game contingent. You can always find players for a board game, whether you bring your own or try out one of the many titles our BGers own and bring each month to our Games Library.<\/p> <p>We ask that everyone attending our Game Days brings something along as a snack and\/or drink, for the community to share in. The facility has a full kitchen, so items that need refrigerated are OK. Most people bring some soda, chips, cookies, veggie tray, etc. This helps everyone have a good time without worrying about snacks or drinks.<\/p> <p>See you at Games Day!<\/p> <p><br\/>Location Information::\u00a0<br\/>Springdale United Presbyterian Church\u00a0<br\/>859 Pittsburgh Street\u00a0<br\/>Springdale, PA 15144<\/p>",

Recently, our friends at North Country Brewing Co. in Slippery Rock reopened the Harmony Inn. They have asked Big Rail Brew to produce some of our own (and some house favorites) beer to go on tap at the Inn.\"<\/p> <p>For this event, BRB will join a live acoustic musician on the Harmony Inn's outside patio to offer up free samples of their brews and to chat with us about their operation. The full bar and full food menu will be available inside. Also inside starting at 4pm will be another live band, so you may want to plan on sticking around for a while.<\/p> <p>Since this event is so far in the future, I'm holding off on opening RSVPs until two weeks prior to the date, which puts us at 2:00 pm on Sunday, May 31. But mark your calendars now...you won't want to miss out on this awesome summertime event!<\/p>",

In this relaxed position and state of mind the transcendent sonic experience begins with the pure tones and overtones of quartz crystal singing bowls, creating a magnificent matrix of vibration to \u201crecalibrate\u201d the human energy system into a powerful place of resonance. Every cell of you and all the water within you begins to vibrate and eventually comes into harmony with everything around you- other people, a sense of place, a feeling of One-ness induced, restored, and supported by sound. Add to this the blissfulness of a flute, singing a song of truth and lightness so bright and clear you will be elevated into a new way of seeing and being. We often begin with the Spirit Drums and end with group free-form toning. It's quite magnificent! I hope you'll join us in the music....<\/p> <p>Just relax, enjoy the sound bath,\u00a0and receive.<\/p> <p>Sliding scale $10- $20<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>",

All levels of play are welcome, and we are novice-friendly. Some people who come have never even held a ukulele, and if you contact Sandy ahead of time, she will bring an extra ukulele for you to try. Try it -- it's fun!<\/p> <p>Music is usually selected from \"The Daily Ukulele... 365 Songs for Better Living,\" by Liz and Jim Beloff. This book is readily available at music stores, book stores, and Amazon.com. Sometimes members bring other music to play (bring 15 copies to share). We play at a large conference table, so bring a table-top music stand if you have one.<\/p> <p>Snacks and libations to share are welcome.<\/p> <p>For more information, contact Sandy at [masked]<\/p> <p>Directions to the Church: Take I279 North to Wexford exit. Turn right at the end of the exit. Right at the light onto Brandt School Road. Right onto West Ingomar Road to 2359. Note - watch for the large sign for the Church and then you will follow a narrow roadway back through the trees to the Church.<\/p> <p>Depending on where you start, there may be a better route to the Church.

If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.<\/p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6.

They have two teenaged daughters. They have built a life together. Forty-three year old Gabby is the last person to have an affair. She can't relate to the way her friends desperately try to cling to the beauty and allure of their younger years\u2026And yet, she too knows her youth is quickly slipping away. She could never imagine how good it would feel to have a handsome younger man show interest in her--until the night it happens. Matt makes Gabby feel sparkling, fascinating,<i>alive<\/i>--something she hasn't felt in years. What begins as a long-distance friendship soon develops into an emotional affair as Gabby discovers her limits and boundaries are not where she expects them to be. Intoxicated, Gabby has no choice but to step ever deeper into the allure of attraction and attention, never foreseeing the life-changing consequences that lie ahead. If she makes one wrong move she could lose everything--and find out what really matters most.\u00a0<br\/>A heartfelt and complex story,\u00a0<i>Tempting Fate<\/i>\u00a0will have readers gripped until they reach the very last page, and thinking about the characters long after they put the book down.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nHope to see you there!<\/p>",

We'll start by focusing on the five basic variables to consider when building a first-aid kit: group size, trip length and distance, potential injuries and illnesses, specific medical conditions and your own medical knowledge and skills. Plus, we'll discuss the benefits of assemble-it-yourself first-aid kits vs. pre-assembled kits. You'll also participate in a hands-on, small-group discussion of the contents needed for a first-aid kit based on three different outing scenarios. You'll assess the needs of each kit based on the first three basic variables outlined earlier in the clinic. Afterwards, the whole group will come together to discuss what first-aid materials would be needed for each scenario. Our experts will also briefly explain the purpose for each item in the kit. They also discuss where it should be placed, so it can be quickly located during stressful emergency situations. Please note: This is not a first-aid certification class. Proper first-aid training is very important for knowing what to do in emergency situations. You should only attempt first aid when you feel comfortable giving it.<\/p> <p>Thank you for your interest in our free \"First Aid Kit Clinic.\" L.L.Bean has a new <b>centralized reservation system<\/b>.

Any lady who can reasonably whack the ball is welcome to come. Two of us (Connie and Darlene) were out there today and it was so refreshing to be able to make mistakes and learn right on the golf course. We don't keep score and we go at a reasonably slow pace. This is the perfect meetup to learn the game and get involved with golf. We would love to have more ladies join us, and if you have time, we do lunch after the game.<\/p>",

The novel is set in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Braddock,_Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania\">Braddock, Pennsylvania<\/a>, a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Steel\">steel<\/a> town just east of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania\">Pittsburgh<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania<\/a> along the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Monongahela_River\">Monongahela River<\/a>. It was first published in 1941 by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Little,_Brown_and_Company\">Little, Brown and Company<\/a>. Based upon Bell's own family of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rusyns\">Rusyn<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Slovaks\">Slovak<\/a> immigrants, the story follows three generations of a family, starting with their migration in 1881 from <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Austria-Hungary\">Austria-Hungary<\/a> to the United States, and finishing with <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_War_II\">World War II<\/a>. The novel focuses on the steelworkers' attempt to unionize from 1889, the first <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Homestead_strike\">Homestead strike<\/a> through the big Homestead Steel Strike of 1892, the Great Steel Strike of 1919 right after <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_War_I\">World War I<\/a>, and the events of the 1930s (&lt;a&gt;Labor Organizing&lt;\/a&gt;). A common connection of struggle, poverty, and entire need of the characters of forces out of their control come together to tell a story of a tragic depiction of a truly troubled group of people. Shared with unbearable financial adversity, the Slovaks nicknamed \"Hunkies\" were also exposed to discrimination by other \"Americans.\" The novel's title refers to the central role of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Steel_mill\">steel mill<\/a> in the family's life and in the history of the Pittsburgh region.<\/p> <p>Long out of print, the novel was rediscovered in the 1970s by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/David_P._Demarest\">David P. Demarest<\/a>, a professor of English at <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carnegie_Mellon_University\">Carnegie Mellon University<\/a>, who convinced director <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frederick_A._Hetzel\">Frederick A. Hetzel<\/a> at the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/University_of_Pittsburgh_Press\">University of Pittsburgh Press<\/a> to reissue it in 1976. The book quickly became a regional bestseller. By the 1980s, however, it found an even larger readership on American college campuses. <i>Out of This Furnace<\/i> is regularly used as required reading in universities to introduce students to the history of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Immigration\">immigration<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Industrialization\">industrialization<\/a>, and the rise of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trade_union\">trade unionism<\/a>, as well as to the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Genre\">genre<\/a> of the American <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Working_class\">working class<\/a> novel.<\/p>",

Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6.

I created this game during my junior year at IUP. The best way to describe the game is that it's a mix between Soccer and Ultimate Frisbee but we use a ball that's about 45\" in diameter. We played it every week for 2 years on the practice soccer field. There is no physical contact with other players permitted but you can use the ball however you want. Any part of your body can touch the ball and there's no height limit on the goals. Also, NO CLEATS OR SPIKES ALLOWED!<\/p> <p><br\/>To see a video of this game in action from 3 years ago, check it out here:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=deBQzfRsBg0\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=deBQzfRsBg0\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=deBQzfRsBg0<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>We will be playing this game at Flagstaff Hill across from Phipps Conservatory.<\/p> <p>Here are some more details &amp; rules.<\/p> <p>Field size we need is about 60 - 70 yards based on how many players we get (best games are at least 7 vs 7)<\/p> <p>There are 3 lines that matter in the game...the goal line on each side and the line at the center of the field. There are no out of bounds lines on the sides of the field.<\/p> <p>Players can dribble, roll, kick, throw or carry the ball for 3 steps<\/p> <p>The goals are as wide as a field goal post in football and there is no height limit on the goal. The game relies heavily on defense. There are also no regulations for goalies or a goalie box. This means your goalie can play mid field if he wants or you can even have 3 goalies...they can even piggyback on each other to be \"taller\" if they want. You just lose those additional players in the field<\/p> <p>Both teams start the game and after each goal at mid-field. The team that wins the coin toss or just got scored on start with the ball. As soon as anything crosses mid-field (the ball OR one of your players that's getting a running start) the other team is allowed to cross the line and start playing defense.<\/p> <p>As mentioned above, there is no physical contact with other players but you can use the ball however you want. If you're in the process of taking your 3 steps you can plow people over with the ball. If someone is charging you, you can kick the ball at them, you can hit people with the ball...I just prefer you don't aim for the head.<\/p> <p>If you do actually blatantly contact someone you get a warning and a 2 minute penalty. Second offense in the same game gets you ejected from the game. This only happened once in 2 years of playing as the ball does a good enough job of not getting players TOO close to each other...<\/p> <p>The ball is built like an exercise ball but it's VERY heavy. I would strongly advise players not try to punch the ball while it's in the air, hit it with one arm or kick it with your feet as it could easily result in an injury or twisting of the body. On that note, it's easiest to \"kick\" the ball with your knees or thigh, hit it with two hands punching close together or hit with the forearms while hands are clenched at the fists.<\/p> <p>We sometimes have players get into a \"scrum\" around the ball and it doesn't move for a while. If that happens and the ball doesn't move for 3 - 5 seconds we'll have a jump ball from where the \"scrum\" took place.<\/p> <p>Games are normally played until 11 and we switch sides of the field when one team scores 6. We usually take a little half-time break at that point too.<\/p> <p>We have had many girls play the sport and they loved it. They were mostly lacrosse, rugby and soccer players though. A few of them even had trouble picking the ball up but they still loved the game. Some of them were actually our most die-hard players.<\/p> <p>We normally start every game kicking and throwing the ball in a circle to get everyone warmed up for how big and heavy the ball actually is<\/p> <p>The game is actually the most fun in the rain because of our most important rule...<\/p> <p>NO CLEATS OR SPIKES OF ANY KIND! All players must wear tennis shoes or some other kind of non-grip shoe so they don't have any advantage in the dirt or grass. That's the way we've always played and I feel that makes everyone very even when it comes to maneuverability on the field. You can only imagine what some rain, puddles and slick grass add to a game where no one has traction. Good times.<\/p> <p>Join us on Thursday, June 18th at 6:30 pm at Flagstaff Hill in Oakland for the first game of Big Ball. \u00a0Just show up to the park to play and bring some friends. \u00a0Don't forget the number one rule...No SPIKES!<\/p>",

For those that want to grab some food before, mention it in the chat. Here is the info about the movie: Bigfoot has come to the town of Ellwood City, PA and is causing BIG problems. Now it\u2019s up to three town locals to take him down.<\/p> <p>Funded by a Kickstarter campaign and filmed in Ellwood City, LA Filmmaker and hometown hero Jared Show assembled a colorful cast of characters from all over the region to bring his vision to life! The movie features some of Pittsburgh\u2019s most famous and best loved celebrities like Curt Wootton (Pittsburgh Dad), Joanie Dodds (America\u2019s Next Top Model), Jim Krenn (stand-up comic, formerly of the WDVE morning show), Mike Wysocki (WDVE), and even veteran news anchor Darieth Chisolm (formerly of WPXI) among others.<\/p> <p>This comedy\/horror flick that doesn\u2019t take the Bigfoot legend all too seriously. Mullets, guns and beer are in full supply as the movie skewers the Pittsburgh \u2018Yinzer\u2019 stereotype right alongside the Bigfoot myth. This is a send-up that will delight anyone who has ever said or heard the phrase, \u201cHey, yinz goin\u2019 dahntahn to pump an Iron \u2018n at?\u201d<\/p>",

Hypochondriac. Lover of Japanese Fighting Fish (and of Charlie Lawton, her\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0reporter boyfriend). Jumper-to-conclusions. And when all these identities collide -- as they do most days -- the results are always unpredictable.<\/p> <p>Sammy's role as an advisor to Vice President Robert Gary (RG for short) has led her down some exciting professional paths, like when she accompanies RG on a trip to India to help open pharmaceutical supply lines, and some troubling ones -- like when the president secretly asks her to plumb those lines to acquire as yet unapproved drugs for his own personal use. Her job interferes with her love life, too, after Charlie is transferred to New York for a huge story just when she's expecting a proposal, and they find that distance combines poorly with Sammy's dedication to her work and her overactive imagination. And then there's the surprising -- though ego-pleasing -- series of passes thrown Sammy's way, culminating in a highly embarrassing photo of a Hollywood hotshot's hand where it doesnt belong, published in the pages of\u00a0Us Weekly\u00a0. . .<\/p> <p>As the dual crises in Sammy's personal and professional lives come to a head, and her ideals are put to the ultimate test, readers will be flipping pages madly, wondering what might come next. Because in Sammy's house, anything is possible.<\/p>",

Emphasizing high standards of contemporary musicianship in a family atmosphere, this series has been called \"the best outdoor music series in Western PA.\"<\/p> <p>This year's 13 free concerts will delight music lovers of all ages with music ranging from jazz to rock to bluegrass, with a taste of folk, new age and country. We're proud of the variety in our programs and try to please the most sophisticated ear. If the music makes you feel like dancing on the lawn, all the better! Dine at one of our fine restaurants or pack a dinner if you wish ... then stretch out on your blanket or lawn chair and enjoy the tunes. Best of all the price is right: FREE! And so is our parking! We want you to have a great evening in our downtown cultural district!<\/p> <p><i>\"Bands such as Fleet Foxes, Shovels and Rope, and Mumford &amp; Sons are at the vanguard of a revival of a musical form running back through Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The Last Bison, from the backwaters of Great Dismal Swamp in Chesapeake, Virginia (VA just happens to be the title of their latest recording), are ready to join that pastoral movement to the musical mainstream.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The very nature of their instruments (acoustic guitar, mandolin, banjo, violin, cello, pump organ), the essence of their lyrics, and the force of their performances, are all imbued with this pastoral sensibility. A good number of their songs start softly and slowly, and build on their acoustic nature into a swell of organic functions, and often, into a crescendo of choral voices singing simple messages layered upon ever more complex levels of melody.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Ben Hardesty, the main piece and singer-songwriter extraordinaire, brings his expressive voice to join with sounds produced by his father, Dan, sister, Annah Housworth, brother-in-law, Amos Housworth, and good friends and neighbors Andrew Benfante and Teresa Totherou. The string section of Teresa (violin, not fiddle) and Amos (cello, upright bass) are particularly evocative of the pastoral ideal. Nestled amongst our lawn and towering trees should be the perfect setting for this eclectic, creative, and transcendent group.\"<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Pre-show music by Emay<\/i><\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>I am unable to commit to hosting and \u00a0attending every Friday, but I'm confident the group can utilize the comment section in order to organize the event.

As long as at least one branch of government kept it's primary goal as liberty, it could stop encroachments on the freedom of the people by the other two branches.<\/p> <p>But what would happen if all three branches of the federal government changed their agendas from freedom to power and coercion? The vast majority of American citizens are unaware that the framers, who understood that a law is only as good as it's enforced, implemented a check and balance for such a situation as well. <b>Fortunately, our system of government gives the power to the County Sheriff to either ignore or enforce Federal law. Neither the President of the United States, the U.S. Congress nor the U.S. Supreme Court can tell the County Sheriff what to do in his or her own county.<\/b><\/p> <p>The County Sheriff is elected by the people, not employed by any branch of the government. Because he\/she takes an oath to uphold the Constitution\u00a0for the United States, his\/her loyalty is towards protecting freedom. He\/she decides which laws are Constitutional and will be enforced and which laws violate his\/her constituents' rights and will be ignored. For the choices he\/she makes, he\/she will answer directly to the residents of his county, not the federal government. Ultimately, the County Sheriff is the check to balance any overreaching authority of the federal government, and is thus the last line of protection against any and all intrusive actions and legislation.<\/p> <p>The Sheriff Project is designed to educate resident volunteers\u00a0as to what they may rightly expect from their County Sheriff and how to determine if their Sheriff is fulfilling his\/her oath to the U.S. Constitution. If the Sheriff is not, the residents, as the Sheriff Project, develop an action plan to either cultivate a relationship with their Sheriff or remove him\/her from office. They stand with their Sheriff and do everything possible to aid him\/her in defending their freedoms and promoting peace, security and constitutional law within the boundaries of their county.<\/p> <p>For more information, see:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/sheriffmack.com\/index.php\/sheriffs\/19-sheriffs\/20-local-sheriffs-are-the-last-defense\">Local Sheriffs Are The Last Defense<\/a><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/sheriffmack.com\/index.php\/sheriffs\/19-sheriffs\/13-the-sheriff-more-power-than-the-president\">The Sheriff - More Power than the President<\/a><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

Over ten memorable weeks known as Freedom Summer, more than 700 student volunteers joined with organizers and local African Americans in an historic effort to shatter the foundations of white supremacy in Mississippi, the nation\u2019s most segregated state. The summer was marked by sustained and deadly violence, including the notorious murders of three civil rights workers, countless beatings, the burning of thirty-five churches, and the bombing of seventy homes and community centers. In the face of this violence, these organizers, volunteers, and Mississippians worked together to canvass for voter registration, create Freedom Schools, and establish an alternative challenge to the State Democratic Party \u2014 the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. Borne of Freedom Summer, and in response to the challenges of registering voters directly within hostile Mississippi, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party registered its own voters outside of the discriminatory system, ultimately sending a delegation of 68 members to attend the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City to confront and unseat the all-white delegation.<\/p>",

Charlie Garcia, aka \"Mr. Candela\"!!<\/p> <p>Charlie Garcia was born and raised in the Bronx, New York where he was exposed to dance at the age of 8 when enrolled into the Bronx Dance Theater. After trying his hand at basketball, chess and many other sports, Charlie began dancing again at the age of 14 at Unified Dance Company. At Unified, not only did he fall in love with dancing, but also with Latin music, most importantly Salsa.

This phrase found on United States currency means \u201cfrom many, one.\u201d But this phrase also aptly describes the parish life in Braddock as well as the resilience of the surrounding communities.<\/p> <p>While the growth of industry and the rise of population in Braddock in the nineteenth century led to the creation of the many ethnic parishes, the loss of industry and economic hardship during the latter half of the twentieth century took a heavy toll. With such huge declines in the once thriving Braddock population, The Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh had a study of this very difficult situation which determined that six parishes -- St. Brendan (Irish), St. Isidore (Lithuanian), St. Joseph (German), St. Mary of Mount Carmel (Italian), St. Michael (Slovak), and St. Thomas (Irish) -- be merged to form a new parish and thus, Good Shepherd Parish was created in 1985.<\/p> <p>The worship site of the Good Shepherd Parish is the former Saint Michael Catholic Church which was completed in 1930 after the original St. Michael Church in Braddock [masked]) had to be replaced. Of historical note is that St. Michael was the first Slovak parish in the diocese.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/b\/d\/600_438195549.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>In case anyone might be interested, please feel to join the Pittsburgh Mass Mob friends as we rediscover another one of Pittsburgh's hidden jewels, another neighborhood church. Join us as we attend Mass and offer our support and right hand of fellowship to this community who have been through so many changes.<\/p> <p>Please note that there will be a tour of the church immediately following Mass (which is usually less than an hour long)<\/p> <p>As a reminder, it is important to recognize that while everyone may have different religious beliefs, we should also try to be respectful and welcoming, and realize that we can sometimes have a tendency to overlook historical things in our own region.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As always, it is also fine if you wish to attend on your own with family\/friends instead.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Pittsburgh Mass Mob is a group that enjoys going to different churches which have historical significance in terms of architecture, rich ethnic\/cultural tradition, etc.\u00a0 Of note is that their are similar Mass Mob groups all across the country where visitors are struck by what they experience with comments such as <i>\u201cIt\u2019s like walking back in history.\u201d<\/i>\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Also Noteworthy -- with this visit to Braddock<\/b><\/p> <p>1) Braddock is the setting for the famous novel \"Out of This Furnace\" by Thomas Bell -- and the local theatre company Unseam'd Shakespeare is presenting a new stage adaptation of \u00a0\"Out of This Furnace\" during June 4-21. Other Meetup events have been scheduled to check out this remarkable play which brings to life three generations of immigrant families living and working in the steel mills of Braddock,\u00a0shedding light on labor issues and the rise of unions which are important aspects of both our region's and country's history (and also based upon Thomas Bell's own family of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rusyns\">Rusyn<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Slovaks\">Slovak<\/a> immigrants).\u00a0 For more details\u00a0about the play \"Out of\u00a0This Furnace\"\u00a0and the Meetup discount code, please visit \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Art-lovers\/events\/220427692\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Art-lovers\/events\/220427692\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Art-lovers\/events\/220427692\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>And if you wanted to see the \"Out of This Furnace\" play on Sunday, June 21 at 2 PM -- there would certainly be plenty of time to go to church (which is located very close to the Edgar Thomson Steel Plant), have lunch, and then see the play.\u00a0<\/p> <p>2) Interestingly in 2013, there was a big movie \"Out of the Furnace\" filmed in Braddock starring Christian Bale, Casey Affleck, Woody Harrelson, Forest Whitaker, Willem Dafoe, Zoe Saldana and Sam Shepard <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Out_of_the_Furnace\"><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Out_of_the_Furnace\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Out_of_the_Furnace<\/a><\/a> but this film is a different story which is NOT based on the Thomas Bell novel \"Out of This Furnace\" or the play.<\/p> <p><br\/>3) However, during the last 10 years, Braddock has undergone revitalization, in part sparked by the arts, entrepreneurship, and strong community leadership.\u00a0A new theatre, new restaurants, green energy businesses, housing initiatives, and other recent developments (such as Brew Gentlemen Microbrewery <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brewgentlemen.com\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.brewgentlemen.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.brewgentlemen.com<\/a><\/a> which recently celebrated its one year anniversary) are making a difference in\u00a0Braddock.

        "description": "<p>E Pluribus Unum. This phrase found on United States currency means \u201cfrom many, one.\u201d This phrase aptly describes the parish life in Braddock and the surrounding communities.<\/p> <p>While the growth of industry and the rise of population in Braddock in the nineteenth century led to the creation of the many ethnic parishes, the loss industry and the decline of population in the area after World War II and the remainder of the twentieth century led to their suppression. In 1982, the Edgar Thompson Works of U. S. Steel closed, causing a major loss of income and people to the area. Beginning in 1983, the diocese conducted a study of the situation in Braddock. The study determined that all six (later seven) parishes in Braddock should be merged to form a new parish. This happened in 1985 and Good Shepherd parish was created.<\/p> <p>The worship site of the Good Shepherd Parish is the former Saint Michael the Archangel Lithuanian Catholic Church. This beautiful church was completed in 1930. Please join your Pittsburgh Mass Mob friends as we rediscover another one of Pittsburgh's hidden jewels, another neighborhood church. Join us as we attend Mass and offer our support and right hand of fellowship to this body of believers who have been through so many changes. God is gracious and has held together his flock here in the Good Shepherd Parish in Braddock, Pennsylvania!<\/p> <p>A tour will follow the Mass at this lovely House of God.<\/p>",

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.<\/p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.<\/p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br\/>\u00a0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Jason,<\/p>",

Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br\/>\u00a0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Jason,<\/p>",

Folks begin arriving around 6PM, and we begin playing each table as soon as we have three or four players plus a set.\u00a0 (We usually have 3-5 tables.)\u00a0 We rotate among the tables... at the end of each game, East walks around to see if another table is close to the end of their game, so that two players can swap places.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>If you have never played, or if you have not played for a very long time, we highly recommend that you take a Mah Jong 101 beginner class before playing with us - beginner classes are offered every few months.\u00a0 Mah jong is a wonderful game, but it's hard to learn by just watching others play!<\/p> <p><br\/>Please order your 2015 card from the National Mah Jongg League, here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationalmahjonggleague.org\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationalmahjonggleague.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.nationalmahjonggleague.org\/<\/a><\/a> Amazon.com also carries the cards. Note that you want the NMJL card, and no other! (There are some colorful alternatives out there.. but we play NMJL card and rules.)<\/p> <p>Experienced players -- please bring your cards and please bring a set if you have one.<\/p> <p>Please do not bring any outside food or beverages into Panera! Instead, please plan to buy *something* from Panera, even if it's just a beverage or a cookie, to support their willingness to host us.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>If you're into music, and even if you're not, here's a great opportunity to share any music you're interested in, have a cup of coffee or tea, and engage in conversation. We'll meet at Coffee Tree Roasters in Shadyside to chat, drink coffee, and listen to music. Bring your favorite music on your phone or thumb drive to share -- you can even bring an instrument to play if you'd like. And you can just come for the coffee and company \u2013 you absolutely aren't required to bring music (I will bring my laptop to look things up on YouTube as well).<\/p> <p>Bring any music -- if you have music of your own creation, if you're passionate about a particular musician or band, or if you just like something and feel like sharing. It could be a recent find or something that influenced your childhood and got you though your teenage years. It could be something you love or it could even be something you hate -- just tell us why. Music is as much a story as anything -- it could be a story of you, or the story of the artist who created the music, or the story could be embedded in the song itself waiting for us to listen. Feel free to bring a story to share along with the music -- or not, if you prefer.<\/p> <p>We're totally open to any kind of music so, please, bring anything you'd like to share be it classical, ethnic, heavy metal, or whatever -- even classical ethnic heavy metal (I bet it exists). We'll be meeting at Coffee Tree Roasters from 7pm (to probably 9pm though the room's booked until 10pm).<\/p> <p>This event is also posted on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetin.org\">meetin.org<\/a>.<\/p>",

For thousands of years, innovators used five simple patterns in their inventions, often without realizing it. These patterns are now embedded into the products and services you see around you. Think of them as the DNA of a product or service. An innovation method called Systematic Inventive Thinking (SIT) allows you to extract that DNA and apply it to anything you want to innovate \u2013 on demand.<\/p> <p>The five patterns have been formed into structured techniques that regulate thinking and manage the ideation process. The method works by taking a product or service and breaking it into components. Using one of the techniques \u2013 subtraction, task unification, multiplication, division or attribute dependency \u2013\u00a0 innovators can manipulate the components to create new-to-the-world ideas. The method literally forces you to create combinations and configurations that you were not likely to come up with on your own.<\/p> <p>Systematic Inventive Thinking is used successfully around the world in virtually every sector, public and private. Companies such as GE, P&amp;G, J&amp;J, and Kraft have applied the method to create new products, processes, services, and business models.<\/p> <p>Registration will open soon!\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pdma.org\/index.php?mo=cm&amp;op=ld&amp;fid=283\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pdma.org\/index.php?mo=cm&amp;op=ld&amp;fid=283\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.pdma.org\/index.php?mo=cm&amp;op=ld&amp;fid=283<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Presenter Biography<\/b><\/p> <p>Drew Boyd is co-author of Inside the Box: A Proven System of Creativity for Breakthrough Results. He is a recognized authority, thought leader, educator, and practitioner in the fields of innovation, persuasion, and social media.

Most of us have a home Internet connection to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) such as Verizon or Comcast. To communicate with each other, all our network traffic must go through these ISPs \u2014 even if the person to whom we are sending an e-mail lives across the street. This centralized way of networking presents many security and privacy problems.<\/p> <p>A mesh network cuts out that centralized middleman. Instead of traffic having to go to a big server hundreds of miles away, a mesh network\u2019s traffic is routed by the shortest and fastest possible path.<\/p> <p>META MESH is building a network of wireless routers to make this model of networking a reality in the Pittsburgh area. That network is aptly named PittMesh. We don\u2019t use expensive equipment to make this happen- in fact we\u2019ve designed our network so that anyone can join it with consumer-grade, off-the-shelf Wi-Fi hardware available at any electronics store. When you join the PittMesh Network, you not only gain access to all the resources and anonymity that an \u201coff-the-grid\u201d network affords, but you expand the network, allowing others to connect and expand the network even further.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nsee<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.metamesh.org\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.metamesh.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.metamesh.org\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pittmesh.net\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.pittmesh.net\/<\/a>\u00a0<\/p>",

Once she sets her hook and starts reeling you in, struggle becomes counterproductive. The narrative line is too taut, the angler at the other end too skillful.\u201d \u2014 Richard Russo Between 1854 and 1929, so-called orphan trains ran regularly from the cities of the East Coast to the farmlands of the Midwest, carrying thousands of abandoned children whose fates would be determined by pure luck. Would they be adopted by a kind and loving family, or would they face a childhood and adolescence of hard labor and servitude? As a young Irish immigrant, Vivian Daly was one such child, sent by rail from New York City to an uncertain future a world away. Returning east later in life, Vivian leads a quiet, peaceful existence on the coast of Maine, the memories of her upbringing rendered a hazy blur. But in her attic, hidden in trunks, are vestiges of a turbulent past. Seventeen-year-old Molly Ayer knows that a community-service position helping an elderly widow clean out her attic is the only thing keeping her out of juvenile hall. But as Molly helps Vivian sort through her keepsakes and possessions, she discovers that she and Vivian aren\u2019t as different as they appear. A Penobscot Indian who has spent her youth in and out of foster homes, Molly is also an outsider being raised by strangers, and she, too, has unanswered questions about the past. Moving between contemporary Maine and Depression-era Minnesota, Orphan Train is a powerful tale of upheaval and resilience, second chances, and unexpected friendship.<\/p>",

(Note: this is a heavily spiritual group with a strong emphasis on the presence of God in all of our lives ... we will use science as support for the concepts in the course, but the focus is primarily spiritual.)<\/p>",

The novel is set in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Braddock,_Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania\">Braddock, Pennsylvania<\/a>, a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Steel\">steel<\/a> town just east of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania\">Pittsburgh<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania<\/a> along the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Monongahela_River\">Monongahela River<\/a>. It was first published in 1941 by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Little,_Brown_and_Company\">Little, Brown and Company<\/a>. Based upon Bell's own family of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rusyns\">Rusyn<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Slovaks\">Slovak<\/a> immigrants, the story follows three generations of a family, starting with their migration in 1881 from <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Austria-Hungary\">Austria-Hungary<\/a> to the United States, and finishing with <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_War_II\">World War II<\/a>. The novel focuses on the steelworkers' attempt to unionize from 1889, the first <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Homestead_strike\">Homestead strike<\/a> through the big Homestead Steel Strike of 1892, the Great Steel Strike of 1919 right after <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_War_I\">World War I<\/a>, and the events of the 1930s (&lt;a&gt;Labor Organizing&lt;\/a&gt;). A common connection of struggle, poverty, and entire need of the characters of forces out of their control come together to tell a story of a tragic depiction of a truly troubled group of people. Shared with unbearable financial adversity, the Slovaks nicknamed \"Hunkies\" were also exposed to discrimination by other \"Americans.\" The novel's title refers to the central role of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Steel_mill\">steel mill<\/a> in the family's life and in the history of the Pittsburgh region.<\/p> <p>Long out of print, the novel was rediscovered in the 1970s by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/David_P._Demarest\">David P. Demarest<\/a>, a professor of English at <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carnegie_Mellon_University\">Carnegie Mellon University<\/a>, who convinced director <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frederick_A._Hetzel\">Frederick A. Hetzel<\/a> at the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/University_of_Pittsburgh_Press\">University of Pittsburgh Press<\/a> to reissue it in 1976. The book quickly became a regional bestseller. By the 1980s, however, it found an even larger readership on American college campuses. <i>Out of This Furnace<\/i> is regularly used as required reading in universities to introduce students to the history of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Immigration\">immigration<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Industrialization\">industrialization<\/a>, and the rise of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trade_union\">trade unionism<\/a>, as well as to the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Genre\">genre<\/a> of the American <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Working_class\">working class<\/a> novel.<\/p>",

His lonely daughter must fight for her land and protect her brother against the scheming of their malignant cousin. This story of land-lust, mystery and folklore is a classic tale, set against the rugged North Atlantic coastline of Ireland in the 1920s. Witness the mastery of one of Ireland\u2019s foremost storytellers and playwrights as he weaves the tale of this Conlee family feud together with the mythical story of a beautiful Celtic princess, Sharon, who meets an untimely end. Similar to the plays of Synge or McDonagh, this is a show for all the family to enjoy.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/8\/8\/3\/600_438566755.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Performance Schedule<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/8\/8\/9\/600_438566761.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>For more information about PICT Classic Theatre and this production, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.picttheatre.org\">www.picttheatre.org<\/a><\/p> <p>For more information about Claddagh Irish Pub, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.claddaghirishpubs.com\/pittsburgh\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.claddaghirishpubs.com\/pittsburgh\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.claddaghirishpubs.com\/pittsburgh\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>",

Confused, angry, and lost, she rents a house on Nantucket for two summer months. When she and her children arrive at Isle Stay, she discovers that Trevor Black, 30, recently widowed, and his son Dylan, 5, have also rented the house. Neither one is willing to give up their much-needed vacations, so Wendy and Trevor devise a plan to share the house for the summer. Preparing meals in their one kitchen, Wendy and Trevor become friends, and chemistry builds throughout the seabreezy summer. But the house is full of their children, and neither is sure they\u2019re ready to move on after recent heartbreaks. Over the last sun-soaked weekend of the summer, as chaos reigns and emotions run as high as the temperatures, Wendy must decide where her heart truly lies.<\/p> <p>Please join us, the book club meetings are such fun! If you don't have time to read the book - just come for the lunch and fun.<\/p>",

Director Z\u00e9z\u00e9 Gamboa's beautifully crafted film the Hero is emblematic of this national effort. Indeed, its extraordinary level of accomplishment heralds a new era of Angolan cinema.<br\/>(Shari Frilot, Sundance Film Festival 2005)<\/p> <p>Synopsis (Courtesy California Newsreel)<\/p> <p>The Hero (O Her\u00f3i) is the story of Angola, a nation torn apart by forty years of uninterrupted war, and now trying imperfectly but courageously to piece itself back together. It is also the story of a city, Luanda, like so many in the Third World, trying to absorb the millions of people displaced by civil strife and global economic change.<\/p>",

Blue Dust will have their famous brisket sandwiches as well as vegetarian options and standard BBQ fare.<\/p> <p>The new Eco-Opera, <i>A New Kind of Fallout<\/i>,\u00a0is inspired by Rachel Carson\u2014a pioneering woman scientist whose work was instrumental in founding the Green Movement in America.\u00a0Two women artists\u00a0were\u00a0invited to write the opera\u2014acclaimed local playwright Tammy Ryan the libretto, and Gilda Lyons the music. The results are thrilling, and Opera Theater of Pittsburgh would like\u00a0to share sections of the work as it is created with audiences in a series of workshops. <i>A New Kind of Fallout<\/i>\u00a0is the first in a series of commissions called\u00a0'Music that Matters,' envisaged as a series of new operas which will address critical issues we confront in our society today\u2014hot button topics such as global warming, race relations, violence, etc. Opera is often viewed as something of a museum art form; this project aims to\u00a0bring that notion up to date by creating new works that are relevant, provocative, and important to people today.<\/p> <p>Free public workshops of\u00a0the new\u00a0Eco-Opera, <i>A New Kind of Fallout<\/i>, have been scheduled\u00a0in venues that matter in terms of preservation of our eco-systems, including the Phipps Conservatory, the Pittsburgh Botanic Garden, Rachel Carson's alma mater Chatham University,\u00a0Carrie Blast Furnace, and\u00a0others. Each workshop will present new scenes from the opera\u2014hot off the press\u2014and explore the issues it raises in discussions with the artists.<\/p> <p>These workshops will lead up to the mainstage world premiere production, which takes place as part of Opera Theater\u00a0SummerFest 2015 in July at the Twentieth Century Club\u2014one of the 'don't miss' cultural events of the year!<\/p> <p>Performance starts at 6:00 pm.<br\/>Free if you bring your own chair or blanket!

If not, we're meeting at the Center for the Arts (see below). If you're confused text me at[masked]-0072.<\/b><\/p> <p><i><b>Weather Update:<\/b>\u00a0If it's rainy and the concert looks like it won't happen, let's meet at 10:00AM in front of or in the lobby of the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts, the yellowish building at the corner of 5th and Shady Ave adjacent to Mellon Park. We can explore the gallery ($5 admission) or we can check out the free yART sale which promises to happen tomorrow rain or shine.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Here's more about the yART sale:<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Pittsburgh Center for the Arts holds an annual \"yART\" sale \u2013 a creative spin on the traditional yard sale \u2013 on the lawn, every summer. Adjacent to Mellon Park, PCA's tree-lined campus is at the corner of Fifth and Shady in Shadyside. Admission is free; and hours are 10:00 \u2013 4:00, rain or shine.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The annual outdoor event features approximately 80 local artists. They are cleaning out their studios to bring affordable art, equipment and art supplies. Expect to find ceramic pieces, photographs, jewelry, art books, fabric, unframed prints, glass pieces, and collectibles.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>It's a great opportunity for folks to get outside, meet local artists, and find a few art bargains. yART Sale prices range from 50 cents to 200 dollars, with most items at bargain-basement prices.<\/i><\/p> <p>I haven't made it over to Bach, Beethoven, and Brunch in Mellon Park the last couple of years. It's a wonderful event but I always end up saying \"maybe next week\" and somehow the summer always passes too quickly. This time, I figured I'd post so I'd have to show up!<\/p> <p>Bring your breakfast or brunch and we'll have a picnic outside listening to great music. Folks from the Bagel Factory will be there if you'd like to buy coffee\/breakfast there. I'll meet you near the front of the stage at 10am. I'll email my phone number out the day before the event. The concert starts at 10:30am. Feel free to bring blankets and chairs and so on.<\/p> <p>From <a href=\"http:\/\/pittsburghpa.gov\/citiparks\/bach-beethoven-brunch\">Pittsburgh Parks<\/a>:<\/p> <p>This longtime favorite series entertains music lovers on the lawn at Mellon Park. Satisfy your appetite for classical music by treating yourself to a special Sunday morning composed of Bach, Beethoven and Brunch. Join us for this delightful buffet of classical melodies.<\/p> <p>Don't miss the \"Best Brunch\" competition! The Pittsburgh Center for the Arts hosts a \"Best Brunch\" competition each week and will award prizes! Citiparks staff members judge the brunches based on presentation, effort and food selection - with the \"Best Brunch\" winner announced during intermission.<\/p> <p>The group performing this week is the Quinta Voce Wind Quintet.

This story, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and inspiring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the Pyramids. Along the way he meets a Gypsy woman, a man who calls himself king, and an alchemist, all of whom point Santiago in the direction of his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles along the way. But what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasure found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.\"<\/p>",

Initially she believed she would only be able to stabilize her neck through surgery to prevent further damage. Journey Forward changed Claire's life.

Journey Forward strives to give their clients the best opportunity at regaining sensation and function below the level of injury while increasing their overall quality of life. The closest Journey Forward is in Massachusetts.<\/p> <p>We desperately need a Journey Forward in Pittsburgh. Not only do others deserve a chance at recovery, but they deserve a chance to feel hope, healthiness and encouragement, and to see their loved ones at eye level again. We all deserve a chance to increase our quality of life, and Claire has seen Journey Forward increase every single person's quality of life at their center, even the staff lives.

        "description": "<p>Thanks to another suggestion from one of our members, we are reading Nick Harkaway's Angelmaker. Here's what the Guardian had to say about it: \"Nick Harkaway is a hyphen-novelist. A tragical-comical-historical-pastoral novelist, if you like; or \u2013 more precisely in the case of this second book \u2013 a fantasy-gangster-espionage-romance novelist. The Gone-Away World, Harkaway's well-received debut, was a slightly overfilled post-apocalyptic pick-and-mix of genres. Just as blithe in its disregard of verisimilitude and generic constraint, Angelmaker flits between old-fashioned villains in London's East End and covert action in 1940s south Asia, arranging its whistlestop plot around the modern-day discovery of a weapon of mass destruction in the unlikely form of a skepful of clockwork bees. It's an ambitious, crowded, restless caper, cleverly told and utterly immune to precis.\" This is a lengthy novel. Please join us even if you don't finish the book :) Hope to see you there!<\/p>",

Folks begin arriving around 5PM, and play begins table by table as soon as we have three or four players plus a set.\u00a0 (We usually have 3-5 tables.)\u00a0 By 6:15 or so, most players have arrived. We rotate among the tables... at the end of each game, East walks around to see if another table is close to the end of their game, so that two players can swap places.\u00a0\u00a0 At the other end of the evening... play must end by 9PM when Panera closes.\u00a0 Tables begin wrapping up play any time after 8:15 or so.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you have never played, or if you have not played for a very long time, we highly recommend that you take a Mah Jong 101 beginner class before playing with us - beginner classes are offered every few months.\u00a0 Mah jong is a wonderful game, but it's hard to learn by just watching others play!<\/p> <p><br\/>Please order your 2015 card from the National Mah Jongg League, here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationalmahjonggleague.org\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationalmahjonggleague.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.nationalmahjonggleague.org\/<\/a><\/a> Amazon.com also carries the cards.

Grace is the God-given gift of divine support to help us rise above our human frailties and limitations. It is the equivalent of receiving from our great Creator a booster shot of \u201ccan-do\u201d energy that mercifully frees us from our own self-created limitations and delivers us from the dramas and mysteries we\u2019ve created or face, an d returns us to the path of healing and spiritual progress.<\/p> <p>Grace is a holy force that pulls us out of internal and external chaos; breaks us out of soul stagnation, illuminates our blind spots; gives us the power and strength to overcome pain, struggle, and dark nights of the soul; and keeps us moving toward our true nature as Spirit walking in God\u2019s holy light.<\/p> <p>When grace embodies our lives, it becomes easier to connect with our Spirit, calm and advance our soul, quiet the ego, and flow in life as a Divine Being and child of light, as opposed to living as a confused and lost soul who struggles in the world.<\/p> <p>We are going to share our stories, have an enlightening exercise and create more anchors for our spiritual development.<\/p> <p>Look forward to seeing you there!<\/p> <p>Love and Blessings,<\/p> <p>Joe<\/p>",

Send emails to:<\/p> <p>[masked]<\/p> <p>You can also leave a post on this event page.<\/p> <p>Remember: Story Night @ Riley's is an event for told stories. You might also want to check out some of the stories featured on our previous storytelling nights, many of which can be accessed here:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/directory.libsyn.com\/shows\/view\/id\/lawrencecconnolly\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/directory.libsyn.com\/shows\/view\/id\/lawrencecconnolly<\/a><\/p> <p>You can also read a recap of one of our recent session here:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/lawrencecconnolly.com\/2015\/04\/30\/springtime-stories-rileys\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/lawrencecconnolly.com\/2015\/04\/30\/springtime-stories-rileys\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Your story should run between five and ten minutes. It should have a clear beginning, middle, and end. It should also have the kind of hook and payoff that typify stories featured on Moth Radio. If you have a performance idea that doesn't fit these guidelines, please let us know in advance. Whatever you talk about, we ask that you to keep in mind that Riley's attracts a general audience, so the recommended language and content is TV-PG. Please spread the word and be sure to bring along friends and fans. It will definitely help to have a cheering section.<\/p> <p>We'll gather at 7:00 (Riley's has excellent food and a terrific bar). Stories begin at 8:00, end at 9:30. Come out and help us grow this exciting venue for spoken-word performance.<\/p>",

You don't have to have any intention of playing on a future Masters or Grandmasters team. Just show up and have fun not chasing around 18 year olds for a change.

Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6.

So much for that. But the spirit of Fight Club remains, the idea of trying to bring out the best in each other through the evolution of consciousness. As Brad Pitt said about the movie, \"Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it.\" And not fear the pain! In this meetup\u00a0we discuss ways that concepts introduced during the Incito Veritas series can be applied to our daily lives. We will learn and grow as we process our experiences. Bottom line: Knowing and Not Doing is Not Knowing, or as it says in James 2:26, \"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead.\"<\/p>",

With two daughters about to start another year at their elite Upper East Side private school and her own career hitting a wall, the effort of trying to stay afloat in that privileged world of six-story town houses and European jaunts has become increasingly difficult, especially as Manhattan descends into an economic freefall.<\/p> <p>As Lisa looks over at her sleeping husband, Sam, she can't help but feel that their fifteen-year marriage is in a funk that she isn't able to place. She tries to shake it off and tells herself that the strain must be due to their mounting financial pressures. But later that morning, as her family eats breakfast in the next room, Lisa finds herself checking Sam's voicemail and hears a whispered phone call from a woman he is to meet that night. Is he having an affair?<\/p> <p>When Lisa shares her suspicions with her best friend, Deirdre, at their weekly breakfast, Deirdre claims it can't be true. But how can Lisa fully trust her opinion when Deirdre is still single and mired in an obsessive affair with a glamorous photographer even as it hovers on the edge of danger?<\/p> <p>When Deirdre's former college flame, Jack, comes to town and the two couples meet to cele-brate his fortieth birthday, the stage is set for an explosive series of discoveries with devastating consequences. <\/i><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Please Bring a Chick Lit\/Women's Fiction book (that is out in paperback)!<\/b><\/p> <p>Not sure what to bring?<\/p> <p>Here is the definition of Chick Lit: Chick lit is genre fiction within women's fiction which addresses issues of modern women often humorously and lightheartedly*<\/p> <p>Here is the definition of Women's Fiction: a modern novel about a woman on the brink of life change and personal growth.

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.<\/p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.<\/p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br\/>\u00a0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Jason,<\/p>",

The sound of a place evolves with its inhabitants, and each creature finds its sonic niche within the environment so that its voice may be heard. Lynn Emberg Purse will discuss \u201cA Year in Penn\u2019s Woods,\u201d her attempt as a composer to combine music, nature and technology into a series of compositions that reflect the sonic and visual diversity of western Pennsylvania\u2019s eco-systems through the seasons. She will share her experiences in collecting sounds and visuals in the field, as well as her ongoing efforts in integrating those resources into what she terms \u201ceco-fusion music\u201d \u2014 music that reflects and integrates the natural beauty around us.<\/p> <p>Lynn Emberg Purse has been filming and recording the sights and sounds of various habitats, particularly in the Pittsburgh area, as source material for a set of musical\/multimedia compositions intended to reveal the immense natural beauty of the area and inspire the protection of those eco-systems. Deeply influenced by R. Murray Schafer\u2019s concept of soundscape and subsequent research by Bernie Krause on measuring the ecological health of a system by its acoustic signature, she has incorporated those concepts into her work as a composer. She is an avid gardener and cites the long hours spent outdoors as a deep influence on her compositional process; she blogs about music and gardening at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/composerinthegarden.com\/\">composerinthegarden.com<\/a>.<\/p> <p><b>Meeting Schedule:\u00a0<\/b><br\/>5:30 \u2013 6 p.m. Networking and refreshments\u00a0<br\/>6 \u2013 6:30 p.m. Presentation\u00a0<br\/>6:30 \u2013 7:30 p.m. Discussion<\/p> <p><b>Directions and Parking:\u00a0<\/b><br\/>This meeting will take place in the Center for Sustainable Landscapes (CSL) Classroom which is located on the facility\u2019s first floor.

We flow from one position to the next and focus on alignment, posture, breath, increased flexibility, strength, and balance. Class is held in the Keith Seminar Center upstairs at Dormont Library.

The classes are usually 50\/50 men and women. Lots of couples - couples, friends, sisters - attend. The class is donation-based. $5 donation is suggested.<\/p> <p>All classes are from 7:00 \u2013 8:00 pm.<\/p> <p><br\/>Beginners are welcome.<\/p> <p>$5 donation suggested.<\/p> <p>Loaner mats available.<\/p> <p>Visit: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dormontyoga\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dormontyoga\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dormontyoga<\/a><\/a> for more info.

        "description": "<p>This meetup is for people who want to learn to initiate a conversation with anyone at any time. For this meetup, you'll be asked to initiate and maintain conversations with people you don't already know (AKA people who are not associated with our meetup group). Very few people can do this without being a little bit nervous. It's time to get over this fear. Being able to initiate a conversation with someone that you don't already know is a useful skill to have, and it allows you to be more comfortable than most people are in social situations.

Why not dedicate your weekend to making some new friends?<\/p>",

That is why I have always done this hike twice every year. Our Summer hike will have different trails and the hike will be a bit longer. Depending on the weather, there might be also an option to swim at Sand Springs Lake. We might even traverse the boulder field. This hikes should be about 15-16 miles long. Other than the longer mileage, this should be considered a moderate hike - there is just one big hill.<\/p> <p><b>Gear:<\/b> Please bring two-three quarts of water, lunch, snacks. Wear sturdy hiking shoes, \u00a0Bring sunscreen, rain gear, extra pair of socks, and anything else you deem necessary for a safe hike.<\/p> <p><b>Directions:<\/b> Meet at 9.30 am at the park office.

        "description": "<p>This month our meetup falls right after the 4th of July! So declare your independence from normal entertainment and get down to Biddle's Escape to play in a backgammon tournament!<\/p> <p>Social hour and registration will run from 6-7, this would be a great time to get a bite to eat to support our awehome hosts.<\/p> <p>Tournament play begins at 7 and lasts until we're done. (about 9 probably)<\/p> <p>The plan is to run two tournaments: a \"novice\" event only for players who describe themselves as beginners, and an \"everyone else\" tournament, for intermediates and experts.<\/p> <p>Beginners will play 3-point matches, advanced will be 5. They need to be short matches so it doesn't take too long.<\/p> <p><br\/>Entry fees will be $5 for novices, with an optional additional $5 side pool, and $10 for everyone else, with an optional $10 side pool. Depending on the number of players, we'll pay 1st and 2nd in each tournament, or just 1st. (I'm thinking minimum of 6 to pay two places)<\/p> <p>And of course, you don't have to play in the tournament at all! You can just show up and play friendly games with other non-combatants.<\/p> <p><br\/>I got some good advice from Bill Davis, who runs the Chicago club and the American Backgammon Tour, about a tournament format where everyone is guaranteed two matches, but will not go too late in the eventing. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Backgammon-Meetup\/pages\/Tournament_Formats\/\">See\u00a0this article\u00a0for more details<\/a> - it's the \"Two-Match-Minimum\" format.

        "description": "<p>Pleasant Vally Park has some pretty easy trails with some decent inclines and views. The longest trail is 3-4 miles and the time spent can vary. The weather forecast for Monday July 6th is showers during the day and partly cloudy at night (for now), so, hopefully, the rain will be out of the area by then. We can always pick a place to stop and back track, finish a whole trail, or blaze our own trails like I did once! We will plan to be back at the parking lot by sunset. Then, we could grab a bite or do something else fun in Murrysville if we feel like it. If any more info is needed or if you'd like to contact me for anything, you can call or text me on my cellphone at[masked]-7462. I'll be coming straight from work after 5:30, and I can check my messages during the day. I look forward to meeting everyone for the 1st Meetup of the revamped HaHoiWC! Thanks!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nUpdate:\u00a0 Depending on the weather, this event could be moved to Tuesday with only a 40% chance of rain instead of the 50% chance on Monday.\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nUpdate:\u00a0 This event is OFFICIALLY MOVED TO TUESDAY due to a much better weather forecast.\u00a0 Monday is scheduled for scattered storms all day.\u00a0 Please plan accordingly.\u00a0 Thanks.<\/p>",

Like other eager politicians-in-training, he went to every political fundraiser under the sun\u2026 but was dismayed to find the music at these events underwhelming, lackluster, loud and un-neighborly. Drawing inspiration from music from all over the world \u2013 crossing genres of classical, jazz and old-fashioned pop \u2013 and hoping to appeal to conservatives and liberals alike, he founded the \u201clittle orchestra\u201d Pink Martini in 1994 to provide more beautiful and inclusive musical soundtracks for political fundraisers for causes such as civil rights, affordable housing, the environment, libraries, public broadcasting, education and parks.<\/p> <p>Check out some videos of concert performances<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9vf4X6WKPtk\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9vf4X6WKPtk<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O0JREwyJK2M\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O0JREwyJK2M<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=feElk3EhNps\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=feElk3EhNps<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>For more Pink Martini videos, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/pinkmartini.com\/video\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/pinkmartini.com\/video\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/pinkmartini.com\/video\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Pink Martini Official Website <a href=\"http:\/\/pinkmartini.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/pinkmartini.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/pinkmartini.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>For more information about Pink Martini, please visit <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pink_Martini\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pink_Martini\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pink_Martini<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>Meetup Ticket Offer<\/b><\/p> <p>The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust has come up with another offer which will include great seats to the concert as well as a pre-show gathering with a free drink at the nearby Backstage Bar (655 Penn Avenue) where we'll also have the option of enjoying live jazz outside at Katz Plaza (corner of 7th and Penn) before walking over to the concert two blocks away at the Byham Theater.<\/p> <p><br\/>Also if you prefer, the free drink coupon could also be used after the concert or any other time at the Backstage Bar\/Cabaret Theater.\u00a0 We realize that not everyone can arrive downtown early on a Friday night, so this is why we're planning both pre-show and after concert options for the group.<\/p> <p><br\/>Please note that availability is limited.

We'll meet at Coffee Tree Roasters in Shadyside to chat, drink coffee, and listen to music. Bring your favorite music on your phone or thumb drive to share -- you can even bring an instrument to play if you'd like. And you can just come for the coffee and company \u2013 you absolutely aren't required to bring music (I will bring my laptop to look things up on YouTube as well).<\/p> <p>Bring any music -- if you have music of your own creation, if you're passionate about a particular musician or band, or if you just like something and feel like sharing. It could be a recent find or something that influenced your childhood and got you though your teenage years. It could be something you love or it could even be something you hate -- just tell us why. Music is as much a story as anything -- it could be a story of you, or the story of the artist who created the music, or the story could be embedded in the song itself waiting for us to listen. Feel free to bring a story to share along with the music -- or not, if you prefer.<\/p> <p>We're totally open to any kind of music so, please, bring anything you'd like to share be it classical, ethnic, heavy metal, or whatever -- even classical ethnic heavy metal (I bet it exists).

Together we deliver the future of healthcare by caring for the community who represent our individual well being for the sake of the generations to come.<\/p> <p>Description<\/p> <p>Three Rivers Free Clinic for the People or TRFCP, is a community based service concerning individuals unable to afford or have easy access to holistic healthcare. Developed to support our elders who represent our roots and traditions, warriors who represent and defend our nation, \"tree\" women who represent the diversity of women who struggle through sexual, physical, mental and emotional abuse, and children in need, who represent our future and inspiration.<\/p> <p>The vision of TRFCP is supported by Herbalist's without Borders, The Union Project and Ola's Herb Shop who have collaborated with the understanding that the importance to provide this kind of space to support all members of the community is paramount. All people reflect our individual selves, therefore our societal health. In addition, access to holistic health interventions are not always accessible and available to everyone, yet are traditionally and scientifically proven to be highly effective forms of healing from which many can benefit.<\/p> <p>The clinic will be available once a month and individuals will sign-up or have scheduled visits (particularly groups coming from a facility or organization).<\/p> <p>Current days are every first Wednesday of the month, hours 1-7p.<\/p> <p>Expect to be supported by volunteer practitioner(s) of holistic health who may provide botanical therapy, meditation, Reiki, intuitive counseling, yoga, massage therapy, reflexology and much more depending on the needs of the people and the practitioners who have volunteered their services for that day.<\/p> <p>It is our hope that all forms of donations, through service, volunteer work or financial bases from interested members of the community, will sustain this vision because it is forseen to create a paradigm shift in community healthcare and delivery for the sake of us all.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>",

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.<\/p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.<\/p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6.
