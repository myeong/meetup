you will learn real tactics and strategies for using the internet to grow your small business.<\/p> \n<p><strong>When it comes to marketing on the interwebs, your website has one of two purposes:<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>1) As a Lead Generation tool (that you can follow up with on the phone or by email etc)<\/p> \n<p>2) As an ecommerce site, to sell your products directly from your site.<\/p> \n<p><strong>What goal you have depends on what type of business you are running, but whichever it is, this group is for you if:<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>- You don\u2019t have the slightest clue what you are doing when it comes to internet marketing, BUT you are open to learning.<\/p> \n<p>- You don\u2019t yet have a website, but would like one, and would like to know how to get one made.<\/p> \n<p>- You do have a website, but can\u2019t get any traffic to it.<\/p> \n<p>- You are getting traffic, but you can\u2019t get any leads or sales (you have no conversions) - You would like to meet other people who are making money online (and are willing to share what they are doing)<\/p> \n<p>- You have heard of the whole \u2018social media trend\u2019 and how marketing your business on sites like Facebook can be very powerful but you don\u2019t know how to do it.<\/p> \n<p>- You are successfully generating leads and making sales online, and would love to share your strategies with others who are also getting great results, so you can all benefit.<\/p> \n<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>1) \u201cWho created this group?\u201d<\/p> \n<p>We did \u2013 Richardson Archil and Eu Ching ANG.<\/p> \n<p>Richardson Archil is a Go-getting, Kick ass Writer, Self-speaker, Poet &amp; Comedian. Totally motivated &amp; dedicated to achieving his goals!<\/p> \n<p>Eu Ching is a Work-at-Home Mom - I assist my husband in the management of his medical clinic as well as running a successful internet marketing home business. I have 3 kids, 2 dogs, 2 turtles, countless fish, a visiting stray cat and run 3 blogs - MomsWisdom.net (parenting), TheEntrepreneurMom.com (Find your Inner Mogul) &amp; BetterFamilyHealth.org (Get off your Tush &amp; Exercise! My hubby's medical blog).<\/p> \n<p>2) \u201cWhy have you created this group?\u201d<\/p> \n<p><strong>There are 3 reasons for forming this group:<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>- Some of the best ideas have come from a mastermind (a small group that shares ideas). There are a lot of internet marketers in Boston who would love to meet others who \u2018speak their language\u2019, but up until now, have never had.<\/p> \n<p>- We love teaching. At each meet up, we will teach a new internet marketing strategy (eg Facebook pay per click, writing an automated email follow-up etc) I also plan to record each one of these sessions and share them with my own list and with members of the group who missed out.<\/p> \n<p>- We would like to offer people quality information that actually works. Anything you learn in this group is proven to work<\/p> \n<p>\u2013 We only share what has worked for us. This is unlike some groups out there, where there\u2019s usually someone up on stage who\u2019s never made money online in his life, talking as if he has (usually to sell their \u2018make money online\u2019 course)<\/p> \n<p>3) How many people usually show up?<\/p> \n<p>To be honest, this is still a small group \u2013 so not too many. But that\u2018s usually good because it means you will get a lot more 1-on-1 attention if you need it, and we can keep things very informal. Eg. You can bring along your laptop and get individual attention, or show the group what you are working on.<\/p> \n<p>4) How long do the Meetups usually go for?<\/p> \n<p>Generally around 2 hours. We can meet around 7pm and likely finish 9ish. But you are welcome to leave early or stay later, it\u2019s entirely up to you.<\/p> \n<p>5) Does it cost anything to attend?<\/p> \n<p>Nope. The meetups are free and we intend to keep it that way.<\/p> \n<p>6) What if I don\u2019t know anything about internet marketing \u2013 Am I still welcome to come?<\/p> \n<p>Absolutely. Most people who attend are just starting out so don\u2019t feel like you have to be some internet marketing geek like us to be a member.<\/p> \n<p>7) Do I need to participate, or can I just watch?<\/p> \n<p>It\u2019s up to you. If you just want to watch the presentations, that\u2019s fine, of course. But if you have questions\/comments and would like to join the conversation, that\u2019s also encouraged.<\/p> \n<p>8) How do I know when the next meetup is being held \u2013 Where are those details?<\/p> \n<p>Just bookmark this site right now. As long as you check back every few days, you will see where and when the next meetup is.<\/p> \n<p>Also you can join as a member, it\u2019s free! Then you will get an email as soon as we announce the times and locations of the next meetup.<\/p> \n<p><strong>We only have one rule:<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>Please don\u2019t use these meetings to pitch your business. You are welcome to tell others what you do of course, but there is a huge difference between self-promotion and being so aggressive about it that it scares off our new members ;D<\/p> \n<p>That\u2019s about it. If you are still reading, then you are obviously interested in learning about this stuff. So why not come along to our next meetup? Who knows? You could get one idea that increases your bottom line by 20% this year, or you could meet someone you end up doing a JV with.<\/p> \n<p>But you will only know if you show up.<\/p> \n<p>See you there, <\/p> \n<p>Richardson &amp; Eu Ching<\/p>\n<p>PS <a href=\"https:\/\/toptierhomebusiness.leadpages.co\/boston-meetup\/\"><strong>Get Meetup updates and Online businessbuilding and marketing tips here!<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":187106567,"name":"Richardson "},"members":60,"name":"Boston Entrepreneur Online Marketing Business Network","id":18790776,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Entrepreneur-Online-Marketing-Business-Network","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Boston MindStormers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Canton","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438453499000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"weight-loss-support","name":"Weight Loss Support","id":15538},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"healthy-weight-loss","name":"Healthy Weight Loss","id":58776}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/South-Shore-Weight-Loss-Wellness-Group-A-Happy-Healthy-You\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>I am a registered dietitian who has set up this group in the hopes of establishing a climate of trust and support for those struggling with or interested in weight loss; it is a forum for open and honest discussions to take place as to result in ownership in your health and longevity.

We hope to have a lively discussion about the model's content, application in practice, to deepen our understanding of the system, and to see in what ways the ideas of socionics can help us to see ourselves and others more clearly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Anyone with an interest in psychology, spirituality, or typology is welcome to join. Beginners are welcomed. The only requirement is an open mind.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The most interesting part of Socionics is dedicated to the intertype relations research. Each personality type, according to Socionics, has a specific core relationship to each other personality type. The theory suggests that some personality types are more and the others are less psychologically compatible based on their personality differences. Socionics dating grows in popularity day by day as more people learn about this intertype relationship theory and gain valuable insights in their private and working relationships. This group is for people to learn and discuss Socionics for the purpose of self-typing and self-discovery, to find the right partner whether it is for a short or long term relationship, to improve their current social, familial, and romantic relationships, and most definitely to connect to other people who are interested in examining their lives and relationships through the Socionical lens.<\/p>\n<p>With this group, you'll be able to find out your Socionics type and learn more about your strengths, values and attitudes towards the world around you, and how you interact with those of different types.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To find out more about Socionics, check out our&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/worldsocionics.blogspot.co.uk\/2014\/07\/an-introduction-to-socionics-part-1.html\">Introduction to Socionics<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We also have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/108330762848816\">Facebook group<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to join our wider community at&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/worldsocionicssociety\">World Socionics Society<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Finally PLEASE support our meetup group by pledging a pound or two per month at our&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/WorldSocionics\">Patreon page.<\/a><\/p>\n<br>","lon":-71.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/b\/a\/highres_440506778.jpeg","photo_id":440506778,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/b\/a\/600_440506778.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/b\/a\/thumb_440506778.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13538250,"name":"Jack Oliver Aaron"},"members":15,"name":"Boston Socionics Society","id":18795123,"state":"MA","urlname":"BostonSocionics","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Socionists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Marlborough","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438550073000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"biblestudy","name":"Bible Study","id":2353},{"urlkey":"christianmin","name":"Christian Ministry","id":6623},{"urlkey":"christiansocial","name":"Christian Social","id":10187},{"urlkey":"praise-and-worship","name":"Praise and Worship","id":15722},{"urlkey":"prayer","name":"Prayer","id":16040},{"urlkey":"christian","name":"Christian","id":17963},{"urlkey":"god","name":"God","id":20588},{"urlkey":"jesus-christ","name":"Jesus Christ","id":20589},{"urlkey":"bible-studies","name":"Bible Studies","id":27271},{"urlkey":"christian-women","name":"Christian Women","id":31382},{"urlkey":"bible","name":"Bible","id":40388},{"urlkey":"small-group-bible-study","name":"Small Group Bible Study","id":49351},{"urlkey":"bible-study-in-a-relaxed-atmosphere","name":"Bible Study in a Relaxed Atmosphere","id":56651},{"urlkey":"prayer-bible-studies","name":"Prayer & Bible Studies","id":68687}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Marlborough-Womens-Bible-Study-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>My goal is to bring women together that are interested in reading the bible, interested in sharing their thoughts, feelings and responses on the women &amp; men of the bible and their stories.

A potion of Group Members will be dismissed (if I deem them counterproductive to the \"group as a whole),\" or \"I cannot teach or give them the spiritual guidance required to reach a Spiritual Enlightenment.\"<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, those who require individual treatment\/therapy will be evaluated to determine if I can assist, help, and\/or guide them, until such time as their Individual Therapy has elevated them back into the \"Main Group.\" In some cases I may refer a Group Member to a different Spiritual Healer or Medical Doctor.

It should be a smell-the-details revolving tour of these towns, an honest attempt to find vitality in old New England stiffness. I can totally see us grabbing some bar pizza in Randolph before heading off to a movie in a nearby theater. Or just hanging out in a members\u2019 place watching films, listening to music, cooking, or just talking about nothing at all. Or maybe going on that hiking trail no one else knows about, or having potlucks, or\u2026<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll go to Brookline, Newton and Quincy, sure, but the main focus is for 30-somethings living in the towns to have some fun without the foregone (forlorn?) conclusion of driving to Boston.

I even managed to see Double Indemnity at the Patriot Place Showcase Theater! That\u2019s right, the home of Tom \u201cBallgazi\u201d Brady! I\u2019d like to discover your down-home finds too.

The NESFA clubhouse is located at 504 Medford Street in Somerville. <br> NESFA hosts a variety of events at the clubhouse in the course of a month. All events at the clubhouse are free to anyone. You don't have to be a member and you do not have to join. All you have to do is open the door and walk in. Game Days, Game Nights, Media Days, Book Discussion Group, the Annual Picnic, the Halloween party, the Bah Humbug game day, and the general Wednesday night gathering are all free to attend. Details for each will be posted in each event listing. <br> Boskone runs in February, and it's one of the longest running SF conventions out there. Many famous authors attend each year, along with editors and publishers. There are discussion panels, nightly events, an art show, filkers, a dealer's room, and I personally run the game room. <br> NESFA is also the parent organization of NEGC (New England Gaming Convention). Two have run thus far. Both were 1-day gaming cons. <br> NESFA Press is the publishing wing of NESFA. NESFAns handle all aspects of the work, from the negotiations to the editing. <br> You'll see NESFA set up at the Boston Book Festival as well. <br> info@nesfa.org is the general email address for nesfa.

So, I started this meetup with a hope, that this will work as a platform for all the folks who have interest in starting a business in USA.<\/p>\n<p>This group is for every one who have keen interest in starting something in US. Let's meetup regularly share our thoughts and start taking steps to do something than just dreaming, wishing and hoping.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\"<i>The biggest risk is not taking any risk... In a world that changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks<\/i>.\" -- <b>Mark Zuckerberg&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u201c<i>You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.<\/i>\u201d &nbsp;--&nbsp;<b>Jim Rohn&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span>As per the above quotes, I believe, without taking calculated risk and by spending time with ordinary people, we will destined to become only average no matter what. Let's raise ourselves, above average and let's join hands do something..&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>\"<i>The only person in the whole world, who is stopping you from achieving your cherished goal is no one, but..you..<\/i>!\"<\/p>\n<p><b>How this meetup works:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>This meetup is for everyone who is aspiring to be entrepreneurs and those who are already having their own businesses, we hope this meetup will be a way to collaborate, share knowledge and take help of each others to be successful in the their endeavors.<span>Below are the some of the core points that this meetup will be focusing on:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>1) Asking Questions and Clarifying your doubts:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\"<i>One of the biggest defects in life is the&nbsp;inability&nbsp;to ask for help&nbsp;<\/i>\" -- <b>Robert Kiyosaki<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\"<i>Asking for help when you need it does not show weakness, it shows tremendous strength&nbsp;<\/i>\"<\/p>\n<p>No one in the world knows all the answers, and everyone has some questions popping up in their mind every time.&nbsp;<span>Especially for the people who have desire to start something, may be coming up with some questions regarding how to start, where to get investments etc. I hope this meetup will help all those people to get answers from others who has already passed though that phase. As, there is no such thing as dumb questions, we encourage everyone to post or comment about whatever questions you have and try to get answers and clarify your doubts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>2) Looking for Partners or Advisors:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>There might be some people who have already started something and may be looking for partners or collaborators for their businesses or sometimes we may just need guidance or support from other entrepreneurs. This meetup also helps those people to present their existing business and ask for others co-operation or partnership.<\/p>\n<p><b>3) Presenting Ideas and Starting it:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>This meetup helps all the budding entrepreneurs to present their ideas or business plans.This can help their ideas to have an evaluation,and either enable other potential investors to investment or to encourage others to partner with them. We will be conducting meetups regularly so people who have ideas or business plans can come and present their ideas.<\/p>\n<p><b>4) Networking :<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\"<i>You become like the 5 people you spend the most time with --<b>CHOOSE CAREFULLY<\/b><\/i>\".<\/p>\n<p>We feel this is the most important thing, that we take very lightly.<\/p>\n<p>The sad thing is:<\/p>\n<p>If you want to be a director, you will be with&nbsp; script writers, producers, directors, then only you can become a director.<\/p>\n<p><span>If you want to be a astronaut, you will be surrounding yourself with co-astronauts, scientists, engineers, researchers etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you are an athlete you will be surrounding&nbsp; with co-athlete's , trainers, couches, training academies etc.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to be a doctor you will be surrounding with fellow doctors, institution's, books, hospitals etc.<\/p>\n<p>They succeeded in their chosen field only by being with the people who help them in achieving their dreams.<\/p>\n<p>Being an entrepreneur or entrepreneurship is nothing different, it is similar to any subject or career.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to be an entrepreneur, you should surround yourself with lawyers, financial advisors, entrepreneur's etc and, we often don't do this.<\/p>\n<p>We think this is the only main thing which we completely forget and start doing something on our own, and we wonder why we fail. May be the reason might be, there is no system or process which helps or supports the fellow entrepreneurs. Because, a shooter cannot win a medal on his own, he cannot train himself, he cannot learn all the new things by himself, he need someone to guide him as a trainer, he need some place to get training like a training academy, and there are numerous people who be willing work for him, he takes those people efforts, to win. He is nothing, without their co-operation.<\/p>\n<p>This might not be applicable for a few entrepreneur's, but those cases are exceptional, we feel this is the best way to approach and start working on your startup.<\/p>\n<p>We encourage people in this meetup to have a strong networking with the other members in the group.<\/p>\n<p><b>5) Sharing knowledge with others:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Sometimes successful people might want to share their knowledge, help others or may be willing to provide their guidance. They might want to suggest something or share their experiences so that the new entrepreneurs will not make the same mistakes they have done. We encourage those successful entrepreneurs or incase anyone who is willing to share any useful information, use this meetup group or use the &nbsp;facebook page or can join watsapp group (given below) and be an active member of this group. If you wish we can conduct a meetup to have your presentation on any useful topic you want.<\/p>\n<p>We are open to any valid criticisms or opinions or suggestions, please post a comment or contact our organizers for what ever questions you have.<\/p>\n<p>\"<i>If you can Dream it, you can do it..!!<\/i>\"<\/p>\n<p><span>Thanks.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Meetup Url:<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Indian-Aspiring-Entreprenuers\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Indian-Aspiring-Entreprenuers\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Facebook Url:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/IndianAspiringEntreprenuers\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/IndianAspir...<\/a><\/p>\n<p>WatsApp(Aspirers):424-456-0274<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/c\/4\/highres_440927812.jpeg","photo_id":440927812,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/c\/4\/600_440927812.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/c\/4\/thumb_440927812.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":44923682,"name":"Kiran"},"members":36,"name":"Indian Aspiring Entreprenuers","id":18822007,"state":"MA","urlname":"Indian-Aspiring-Entreprenuers","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"aspirers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439292647000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"pingpong","name":"Ping Pong","id":3262},{"urlkey":"table-tennis","name":"Table Tennis","id":6640},{"urlkey":"park","name":"Park","id":16782},{"urlkey":"family-friendly","name":"Family Friendly","id":22233}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Runaround-Ping-Pong-Greater-Boston\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>All ages are welcome, both young and old.

I\u2019d like to model this group off of the Salons in Paris in the 1700-1800s. There is something great about sharing ideas with others in a respectful dialogue which was so crucial to the fostering of enlightened thought in that age. My aim is to recreate these spaces for true dialogue. I\u2019d love a real exchange of ideas and thought provoking questions. I\u2019d love to create a LGBT community based on these two ideas.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>This group will encourage people to voice controversial ideas. Ridicule or vilification is strictly prohibited to encourage even the most contentious voices be heard and engaged with on a respectful level. I hope we all can expect to hear things we disagree with during our meetings and would actually be disappointed if it didn\u2019t happen.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span>There will be two ways this group will get the topics of conversation: first from attending lectures at universities in the area. We will then get together at a coffee shop, lounge or bar to discuss what we listened to at the lecture. The second method that topics will be selected is by popular vote. I\u2019ll be soliciting topics and then putting them all to a vote. I hope this adds spice and a level of spontaneity to discussions. Anything is ok for discussion from this popular vote. I hope this keeps things spontaneous and interesting.

With this goal in mind, I've created this Meetup Group. It's completely free and will meet regularly --- if you're looking to improve your Spanish, German, and French, and later even other languages, then you're on the right page.<\/p>\n<p>I'm bilingual, fluent in both English and Spanish, and would like to improve my German and French. I created my first Meetup Group when I was living in Germany and it was a lot of fun. Here's an idea of how the setup has worked in the past:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1. The group practices speaking a language for 30 minutes and then switches. Usually the group will naturally break down into 3-4 smaller groups practicing whatever languages they choose. <br>2. You may also practice your language of choice for the entire session if you find someone who also wishes to practice that language. <br>3.

That's are school motto. And the most important reason to join us. <br><\/p>\n<p>Athena School of Arms is a Boston-based school that studies and trains Historical European Martial Arts. We teach two styles: the Longsword tradition of Johannes Lichtenauer and the Scottish tradition Broadsword and Smallsword. <br><\/p>\n<p>Athena fencers are motivated towards a demanding physical and intellectual goal. It is not simply enough to improve athletically - the study of historical arts requires a commitment to documents written hundreds of years ago, frequently in another language. In short: we are nerds.<\/p>\n<p>And fencing is a thinking sport; there are tactics and strategy to go along with the history.<\/p>\n<p>Many Historical fencers are fans of science fiction or fantasy literature. Many of us are gamers. Now we have a physical activity which links our other passions into one awesome life. And introduces us to other members of the same community.<\/p>\n<p>Athena fencers show up with a wide variety of backgrounds and skills in physical activities. And wide variety of shapes and sizes. Some are former modern fencers or kendoka. Others have never before found a sport they liked. The classes are small and always tailored to make sure everyone can succeed.<\/p>\n<p>You should join Athena School of Arms because you want to fight with swords. And to become more fit. And to learn about healthy exercise for life. And for an intellectually challenging activity. And to hit people with swords.<\/p>\n<p>A typical class is 75 minutes long. We start with 30 minutes of physical preparation. A warm-up is followed by work on either agility or speed. Then we have a Power and Core circuit.<\/p>\n<p>Then we have the actual sword curriculum. Every class starts with footwork. Attacks and defenses are developed. Progressively more protective gear and higher intensity are introduced to move towards understanding the historical fight.<\/p>\n<p>We also regularly engage in free play and have monthly, friendly class tournaments. And these are followed by all going out to dinner together. <br><\/p>\n<p>It is amazing to see some of the friendships developed within the school. Most of us were invited to the weddings of 3 different members. <br><\/p>\n<p>Athena School of Arms also works to reconstruct the Dagger, Sword and Buckler, and Grappling arts. Training includes free play, drills, test cutting, and physical fitness; together, these elements help students to understand and recreate combat on the battlefield, the list, and in personal defense. <br><\/p>\n<p>Starting in the 14th century the people who trained in the use of the sword started to write down the instruction they received in the art of fencing. Our group, and groups like ours from all over the world, work to reconstruct the Historical European Martial Arts. And they are martial arts. What we do is not choreographed and we use realistic weapon simulators.

We'll read a new book every six-ish weeks and meet as a group to discuss. The books will range from the classics, such as \"Light On Yoga\" by BKS Iyengar, to memoirs such as \"Misadventures of a Garden State Yogi\" by Brian Leaf and everything yoga related in between. Any member can nominate books for the group to read - see below. All levels of yoga geeks are welcome! Book Club Rules 1) The first rule of yoga book club is that there are no rules. 2) Actually, there are a few of them. 3) Be nice. 4) Book clubs are kewl. 5) Share! Seriously - this won't be any fun if we're all just quietly staring at our shoes. 6) Books are chosen by picking names out of a fish bowl. Any member can nominate a book to be added to the fish bowl, and next book to be read will be picked at the end of each meeting.

Thanks for visiting. This group is designed to be a safe space for men to receive and offer support to other men around men\u2019s issues. It is a place to share thoughts, ideas, struggles and victories in an open, non-judgmental setting around what it is to be and express one\u2019s individual maleness in a culture whose ideas about what it is to be a man may conflict with our own. In this space, you are welcome and encouraged to define and express your maleness by your own truth and definition. Often in our culture, we sometimes find our truth extends beyond what is outlined by others to be appropriate or acceptable ways for men to act or behave, and often leaves us feeling shamed for not fitting more easily into a particular mold. Whether you find yourself in or outside of the fringe, you are welcome here. Some areas where men may feel this struggle are: power and privilege, poverty, career, education, sexual orientation, being single by choice (particularly after divorce and children), race, nudist identified, erections, erectile dysfunction, beliefs around monogamy and infidelity, polyamorous relationships, substance abuse and recovery, cigarette smokers, body size\/physique, piercings, tattoos, body hair, fetish and kink interest, and femininity. As you can see, scrutiny toward the male gender runs the gamut. Whatever your proclivity, you will be celebrated here for all that you are. What will we do? The initial format (which will always be shaped by its members) will include a 90 minute gathering once a month. There will be social component as well as some structured time with a theme and discussion. The goal is to have this be a clothing free group to support risk taking, to encourage opening oneself up symbolically, to enhance the bonding process, and to create an environment that practices its core value of de-shaming and acceptance. This is a free group, though donations are kindly accepted (yet not required) to cover some costs involved in putting this together. If this sounds like a place you would like to spend time, please shoot me an email and introduce yourself. I look forward to our time together.<\/p>","lon":-71.1299972534,"join_mode":"closed","members":1,"name":"Boston Men's Support Network Meetup","id":18866745,"state":"MA","urlname":"Brookline-Mens-Support-Network-Meetup","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":42.3300018311,"who":"Men"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Lowell","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1440522878000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cvtgvgggyuh-Ffjjn-Ugfj\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Bvbgvgg gggggy herb guidance.

These are wonderful, sudden shifts in one\u2019s reality where we break out of the content of us and become the context in which the content of our lives arises. Awakening can temporarily break us out of our identification with our body, mind and personality, providing us a witnessing presence that is free. But this awakening will not last unless one understands what one has awakened to.\n\nYou Cannot Teach Awakening\n\nYou cannot teach someone how to awaken. You cannot teach someone who is currently asleep how to awake up. This is because they will convert everything they experience or hear into something consistent with their sleeping consciousness i.e. a better version of sleep. Awakening in itself is not a path. There is not a technique for awakening.  It is a symptom of a process, mostly hidden from us, a rare combination of factors, most of which we cannot control.\n\nSomething other than what is available to our current sleeping consciousness is needed to awaken it. It is ignorance of our true nature that keeps us asleep. This ignorance thinks it is awaken even when asleep. This ignorance not only binds us but defines who we are and what is possible, having us believe that our sleeping state is real. Dreaming of being awake does not awaken us.\n\nIt is the arrogance of our modern, ignorant intellect that imagines it can teach awakening or know or control the forces that keep people asleep and\/or allow awakening to happen. We do not control these any more than we can control chance or accident. Yet if awakening is an accident, then there may be something that can make us accident prone. Understanding this is a start.\n\nThe Purpose of Awakening\n\nThis Creation has a purpose and spiritual awakening is an expression of this purpose. Thus, it is a stage of a process, a symptom of an expression of an Original Intent that brought this Creation into existence. As a seed planted in the ground carries inherent in it the fruit, so too does awakening carry within it the purpose of its existence. Awakening is the beginning of a process, not the end. It is the next stage in the emerging potentiality that lies inherent in every living being.\n\nThe Greater Awakening\n\nAn individual awakening is not an isolated event. It is a reflection of a larger, collective awakening; a shift in consciousness that is currently happening on the planet. There is now an opportunity for mankind that has never existed before. Thus, the individual awakenings that have been occurring since the 1960\u2019s are like spring after a long dormant winter, an emerging of a new possibility for consciousness, the likes of which has never existed before.\n\nA Path to Awakening\n\nIn my experience most people awakening comes progressively. It slips up on them without them knowing it, until one day they realize they are awake. This preparation is Yoga. Yoga is conscious turning of our attention and effort to that which we do not yet know, but sense deep within ourselves. Yoga is a process by which we apply discrimination and effort to break the hold of our limited, individual reality to that which is greater. Yoga is the effort, the action, we apply to awaken and eventually to merge with that which is greater than oneself.\n\nIn this way we gain the strength and authority that gives us the resolve, the commitment and endurance to turn to the universal forces that will initiate a transformation process that will convert what is left in us into a vehicle for Divine manifestation.\n\nAwakening is the Beginning not the End\n\nAwakening has a purpose. It is for each awakened person to awaken further. There is a greater awakening, an awakening to the universal reality that lives within, be that God, Truth or the Absolute. The witnessing presence that comes from awakening is weak at first because it is still limited by the unquestioned assumptions that are still hidden. The more we attend to that which is not awakened in us the more we gather the capacity to break free of these. The witnessing presence gathers a self-reliant authority and with it the resolve needed to awaken fully to this possibility. Next is to turn to the universal reality that is all about us. To reach out and up out of our limited perspective as human beings into a cosmic state of being.","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":143418152,"name":"laura"},"members":1,"name":"Boston Enlightenment Meetup","id":18883882,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Enlightenment-Meetup","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brookline","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441023693000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"support-group-stop-smoking","name":"Support Group: Stop Smoking","id":28956},{"urlkey":"stop-smoking-support-group","name":"Stop Smoking Support Group","id":28957},{"urlkey":"stop-smoking","name":"Stop Smoking","id":31406},{"urlkey":"nicotine-addiction","name":"Nicotine Addiction","id":51713},{"urlkey":"stop-nicotine-use","name":"Stop Nicotine Use","id":62779},{"urlkey":"smoking-cessation","name":"Smoking Cessation","id":62780},{"urlkey":"healthier-alternative-to-tobacco","name":"Healthier Alternative to Tobacco","id":82074},{"urlkey":"quit-smoking-support","name":"Quit Smoking Support","id":397972}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brookline-Quit-Smoking-Support-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for people who are seriously preparing, in the process, or have quit smoking but need person to person support.

A mastermind group helps you and your mastermind group members achieve success. Participants challenge each other to set powerful goals, and more importantly, to accomplish them. The group requires commitment, confidentiality, willingness to both give and receive advice and ideas, and support each other with total honesty, respect and compassion. Mastermind group members act as catalysts for growth, devil\u2019s advocates and supportive colleagues. This is the essence and value of mastermind groups.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What a Mastermind Group is NOT&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It's not a class. While your group can vote to bring in guest speakers and teachers occasionally, the main focus of a mastermind group is the brainstorming and accountability support among the group members. It's not group coaching. Mastermind groups are about the MEMBERS sharing with each other, not about the Facilitator coaching individuals in a group setting. You get everyone's feedback, advice and support. Yes, if the Facilitator is an expert on the topic, by all means chime in. But keep the conversation balanced between all members. It's not a networking group. While you may share leads and resources with each other, it is not the main focus of the meetings. However, through your connections with other members, you will find plenty of joint venture opportunities, lead sharing, and professional networking.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Napoleon Hill's Definition&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The concept of the \"mastermind alliance\" was formally introduced by Napoleon Hill in his timeless classic, \"Think And Grow Rich,\" though mastermind groups have been around since the beginning of time. Even Benjamin Franklin belonged to such a group, which he called a Junto. Napoleon Hill wrote about the mastermind group principle as: \"The coordination of knowledge and effort of two or more people, who work toward a definite purpose, in the spirit of harmony.\" He continues\u2026 \"No two minds ever come together without thereby creating a third, invisible intangible force, which may be likened to a third mind [the master mind].\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What You'll Get From Belonging to a Mastermind Group&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In a mastermind group, the agenda belongs to the group and each person's participation and commitment is key. Your mastermind partners give you feedback, help you brainstorm new possibilities, and set up accountability structures that keep you focused and on track. You create a community of supportive colleagues who brainstorm together to move the members to new heights. You'll gain tremendous insights which improve your business and personal life. Your mastermind group is like having an objective board of directors, a success team, and a peer advisory group, all rolled into one.<\/p>","lon":-71.1299972534,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10917238,"name":"Sarah Martin Hawkins"},"members":1,"name":"Small Business Owners Mastermind Group","id":18890245,"state":"MA","urlname":"Roslindale-Small-Business-Owners-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":42.2799987793,"who":"Business Builders"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441149542000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"home-based-travel-agents","name":"Home Based Travel Agents","id":15937},{"urlkey":"hospitality-industry","name":"Hospitality Industry","id":21716},{"urlkey":"travel-agents","name":"Travel Agents","id":25868},{"urlkey":"travel-business-entrepreneurs","name":"Travel Business Entrepreneurs","id":28441},{"urlkey":"tourism","name":"Tourism","id":29394},{"urlkey":"hospitality-tourism","name":"Hospitality & Tourism","id":33114},{"urlkey":"hotel-industry","name":"Hotel Industry","id":39256},{"urlkey":"business-travel","name":"Business Travel","id":42413},{"urlkey":"travel-professionals","name":"Travel Professionals","id":65724},{"urlkey":"travel-blogging","name":"Travel Blogging","id":124930},{"urlkey":"destination-marketing-organizations","name":"destination marketing organizations","id":137231},{"urlkey":"travel-networking","name":"Travel Networking","id":139371},{"urlkey":"travel-industry-networking","name":"Travel Industry Networking","id":427572},{"urlkey":"travel-start-ups","name":"Travel Start-Ups","id":634982}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Young-Travel-Professionals-Boston-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"YTP (Young Travel Professionals) is a group for young professionals in the travel &amp; hospitality industry who are interested in networking and connecting with the next generation of industry leaders.
