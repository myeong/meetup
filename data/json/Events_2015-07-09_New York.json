ONLY 3% of businesses have a strategy to generate those referrals. Our BNI networking meetings are a proven word of mouth marketing referral generating strategy. Last year, members of BNI (Business Networking International) passed millions of referrals that generated billions of dollars of business for each other. Belonging to BNI is like having dozens of salespeople representing your business, and in return you are representing their businesses. What goes around comes around. If I help you, you\u2019ll help me and we will both benefit as a result.<\/p> <p>Here are the details for our next meeting Tuesday, June 9th 2015<\/p> <p>The meeting starts at 7:00AM and is officially over at 8:30AM<\/p> <p><b>We are looking for a professional IT person and a general contractor to pass warm referrals too. \u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Our Location: Nevada Diner 80-26 Queens Blvd, Elmhurst, NY 11374 (718) 426-2229.<\/p> <p><br\/>Plenty of Parking, trains: M &amp; R, Grand Ave station<\/p> <p>The cost is $15 which includes breakfast.<\/p> <p>Please bring 30 business cards to pass out.<\/p>",

This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly.

        "description": "<p>One day a year, nine of the city's finest museums, all ones that call Fifth Avenue home, collectively open their doors for free to New Yorkers and visitors for a mile-long block party and visual art celebration.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Begun as an initiative to spur the development of new museum audiences and to increase support for the arts during the fiscal crisis of the 1970s, Museum Mile was formed as a consortium by the museums that share the Fifth Avenue address. The first festival, held in June of 1978, was an instant success. Not only did it expose New Yorkers and NYC visitors to an incredible collection of New York\u2019s artistic riches, it also brought together disparate New Yorkers. From the barrios of East Harlem and the townhouses lining the Upper East Side, to the winding streets of the Village and the clustered neighborhoods of the outer-boroughs, people came to celebrate their shared pride in their city. Museum Mile Festival promoted public awareness through increased visibility, accessibility and attendance at all the museums, and brought many New Yorkers to upper Fifth Avenue for the first time.<\/p> <p><br\/>This traffic-free, music and art-filled celebration fills the street and sidewalks of Fifth Avenue from 82nd to 105th Street, the mile now officially designated as Museum Mile.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Visit\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.museummilefestival.org\/\">www.museummilefestival.org.<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\nIn the past, we usually hit 4 museums... \u00a0so do come early. as the lines get longer and longer into the nite.<\/p> <p>My recommendations:<\/p> <p>86th Street and Fifth Avenue \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Neue Galerie New York\u00a0<\/p> <p>90th Street and Fifth Avenue \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 National Academy Museum Schl<\/p> <p><br\/>92nd Street and Fifth Avenue \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Jewish Museum<\/p> <p><br\/>104th Street and Fifth Avenue \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 El Museo del Barrio<\/p> <p><br\/>103rd Street and Fifth Avenue \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Museum of the City of New York<\/p> <p><br\/>91st Street and Fifth Avenue \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian \u00a0<\/p> <p>Opening Ceremony 5:45pm @ Cooper<\/p> <p>Please note that Guggenheim and Met are free on Fridays every week already.<\/p> <p>See more at: <a href=\"http:\/\/museummilefestival.org\/index.php\/map-schedule#sthash.dHruM4NV.dpuf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/museummilefestival.org\/index.php\/map-schedule#sthash.dHruM4NV.dpuf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/museummilefestival.org\/index.php\/map-schedule#sthash.dHruM4NV.dpuf<\/a><\/a><\/p>",

The reason it says it's maxed out, is because I can't sign you up through meetup.com. To RSVP, please send an email to alfred dot vachris at gmail dot com, with your first and last name. A photo ID is mandatory. You will receive an email once a month from the Microsoft Organizer. We plan on meeting on the 2nd Tuesday of every month, but there are changes occasionally. You should receive an email, if there's a cancellation. The Conference Center's security department, requires your first and last name, so please include your full name, within the body of your email. Sometimes, the map on this meetup link above, is incorrect, so please write down the address, (at 41st Street and 8th Avenue, NorthEast corner... i.e. not in Port Authority). If you don't get an email back from anyone, within a day or two, please send a 2nd request. I always learn something new at the group, like an advanced feature, or a glitch\/bug to beware of. For example, did you know that formulas entered in the Named Range box calculate as \"Array Entered\". It's OK, to arrive half an hour early and use the free coffee machine. Try to go early, if it's your first time, in case you are not registered properly. If you arrive, and the the security personnel informs you of a registration problem, don't be alarmed, they will assist you. Please be patient. This event is scheduled for 5:45 PM and 6:00 PM. See link below. After you receive an email from the Microsoft Organizer, stating we will meet on this date, you may sign up for the 6:00 PM event, (no seating limitation, but the security desk closes a little after 7:00 PM). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Spreadsheets\/events\/calendar\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Spreadsheets\/events\/calendar\/<\/a><\/p>",

Who has a limited entertainment budget like me? LOL Well this is the event for YOU!<\/p> <p>My local theater has discount Tuesday every week and if you sign up online they will even send you a coupon for the concession stand, each week a different one (this weeks is free small popcorn with a drink purchase). They also have those awesome new reclining seats! And you get to choose and pay for your seat in advance so there is no rushing in at the last minute and sitting in the front row and straining your neck!\u00a0 Here is the link to the theater for more details: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinemark.com\/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=83854\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinemark.com\/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=83854\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.cinemark.com\/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=83854<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>So here is how it's going to work each week. I will choose a movie when the new schedule goes out (Thur\/Fri) and choose the <b>movie and showtime.<\/b> I will buy my seat online and post what <b>row and number<\/b>. Those of you who wish to join me can buy your seat near me. There are two ways to buy seats: 1) online in advance is your best bet but there is a $1.25 service fee per ticket 2) At the theater no service fee but you really need to driver there in advance if you want seats near us. OR you can just show up that night and sit wherever there is space available.<\/p> <p>If anyone wants to host dinner beforehand please post and say so, The Red Oak diner is nearby, fast, has something for every taste and budget, and will gladly give you separate checks. I will come for dinner IF I can make it but can't promise due to work schedule.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.redoakdiner.com\/online\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.redoakdiner.com\/online\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.redoakdiner.com\/online\/<\/a><\/a> Hope to see YOU at the movies!!\u00a0 Love, Cassie<\/p> <p><b><i>if you can't make it, no need to post why.

        "description": "<p>One day a year, nine of the city's finest museums, all ones that call Fifth Avenue home, collectively open their doors for free to New Yorkers and visitors for a mile-long block party and visual art celebration. Begun as an initiative to spur the development of new museum audiences and to increase support for the arts during the fiscal crisis of the 1970s, Museum Mile was formed as a consortium by the museums that share the Fifth Avenue address. The first festival, held in June of 1978, was an instant success. Not only did it expose New Yorkers and NYC visitors to an incredible collection of New York\u2019s artistic riches, it also brought together disparate New Yorkers. From the barrios of East Harlem and the townhouses lining the Upper East Side, to the winding streets of the Village and the clustered neighborhoods of the outer-boroughs, people came to celebrate their shared pride in their city. Museum Mile Festival promoted public awareness through increased visibility, accessibility and attendance at all the museums, and brought many New Yorkers to upper Fifth Avenue for the first time.<\/p> <p>This traffic-free, music and art-filled celebration fills the street and sidewalks of Fifth Avenue from 82nd to 105th Street, the mile now officially designated as Museum Mile.

Try to go early, if it's your first time, in case you are not registered properly. If you arrive, and the the security personnel informs you of a registration problem, don't be alarmed, they will assist you. Please be patient. This event is scheduled for 5:45 PM and 6:00 PM.

On.<\/p> <p><i><b>If you don't know, now you know ...<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>If you've never played the game of kickball as a kid you must have grown up on Mars. But as a quick primer, it's a game with rules similar to baseball -- except instead of using a bat to hit a little ball, you use your feet to kick a ball about 10x the size of a baseball. Kick the ball, run to the base, avoid getting your ball caught mid-air or yourself tagged out. Easy. And <b>no athletic skill is necessary<\/b>, just the ability to kick! Go out and practice now to get ready. Kick the postman when he delivers your bills. Kick that neighbor who won't turn down his stereo. Just get kicking!<\/p> <p>If you haven't played the game in 20 years, here are the general rules we will be using <a href=\"https:\/\/dl.dropboxusercontent.com\/u\/64476072\/Kickball%20Rules.pdf\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dl.dropboxusercontent.com\/u\/64476072\/Kickball%20Rules.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/dl.dropboxusercontent.com\/u\/64476072\/Kickball%20Rules.pdf<\/a><\/a>.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.neighborhoodsports.us\/Rules\/KickballRules\/tabid\/155\/Default.aspx\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/a><\/p> <p><b><i>A $3.00 organization fee will be collected at this event, your host is in the running for hardest working person on meetup.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><i><b>The important stuff ...<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0This is a co-ed game so ladies don't be shy to sign up.

Bohemian, the Noho sister of a bar in the Nishiazabu district of Tokyo, is tucked into the back of a building that used to belong to Andy Warhol. To reach the front door, you pass through a hallway dubbed \u201cBasquiat Road\u201d (the artist died in his loft at this address). Inside is an apartmentlike, low-ceilinged room containing just 25 plush seats, including a couple of couches and a six-seat yellow pine bar. The white-walled room is Zen simplicity, from the back bar made of tatami mats to a diorama-like mini Zen garden built into one wall to a central skylight that facilitates the art of \u201ctsukimi sake\u201d (moonlight boozin\u2019). Bartenders serve a mix of signature and classic Asian and American cocktails, plying their craft with such precision that each time they present a drink, they shine a spotlight on it. Kiyo Shinoki, formerly the executive chef at Chanto, tells us Bohemian is more of a restaurant in the evening. He serves a mix of American, French, and Japanese small plates (everything from a burger with homemade pickles to short rib sashimi), and then later in the night, until 2am, the space takes on a lounge vibe, with bossa nova, jazz, and Japanese music. As with the Tokyo original that\u2019s hidden behind a house, there isn\u2019t any standing room, just seating at a row of low-to-the-ground two-tops and a couple of couches. In fact, Shinoki says he wants to maintain a maximum 60 percent capacity.<\/p> <p><b>MENU:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Dinner Menu 1<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/y2BTWUqsNg6xNYppqH7nZg\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Dinner Menu 2<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/Hn4DX2L2A1zjX2f4hQDjiQ\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>RESTAURANT GALLERY:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Inside the restaurant<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/mJgZASG-c6nkAdC9_EF1kg\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0A hidden room inside the restaurant<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/Hew-Oovz5UEdXYNYGdzf7Q\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0The Bar<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/4jMx1Zn-7G-XhqghjiMksQ\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>FOOD GALLERY:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Seafood Paella<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/LBGsS3-UGxFTqpwuzCAGiw\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Branzino<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/-Dx3Pl4tfYA67vlOL-zG3g\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Oysters<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/5gFQkmLzL5s35dGy21kUew\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Washu Beef Short Rib Sashimi<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/5jtxiHzuaFLoJxevfJNxRQ\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Uni Croquette.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/KVIJRWB5GxsSEdDOB6pWVw\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Beef Tarter Flatbread<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/H2w5NHAPkA-uAMLNdpVzMw\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>RESTAURANT REVIEW:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/bohemian-restaurant-new-york\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/bohemian-restaurant-new-York\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/bohemian-restaurant-new-York<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.playearth.jp\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.playearth.jp<\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Disclaimer:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>END<\/p>",

But as a quick primer, it's a game with rules similar to baseball -- except instead of using a bat to hit a little ball, you use your feet to kick a ball about 10x the size of a baseball. Kick the ball, run to the base, avoid getting your ball caught mid-air or yourself tagged out. Easy. And <b>no athletic skill is necessary<\/b>, just the ability to kick! Go out and practice now to get ready. Kick the postman when he delivers your bills. Kick that neighbor who won't turn down his stereo. Just get kicking!<\/p> <p>If you haven't played the game in 20 years, here are the general rules we will be using <a href=\"https:\/\/dl.dropboxusercontent.com\/u\/64476072\/Kickball%20Rules.pdf\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dl.dropboxusercontent.com\/u\/64476072\/Kickball%20Rules.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/dl.dropboxusercontent.com\/u\/64476072\/Kickball%20Rules.pdf<\/a><\/a>.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.neighborhoodsports.us\/Rules\/KickballRules\/tabid\/155\/Default.aspx\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/a><\/p> <p><b><i>A $3.00 organization fee will be collected at this event, your host is in the running for hardest working person on meetup.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><i><b>The important stuff ...<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0This is a co-ed game so ladies don't be shy to sign up.

Stall counts are used on occasion, cleats are optional, boundaries are flexible, and all skill levels are welcome!<\/p> <p>There are two ways to stay in touch outside of Meetup.com:<\/p> <p>- Follow us on Twitter: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/nycultimate\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/nycultimate<\/a><br\/>- Like us on Facebook: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/nycultimate\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/nycultimate<\/a><\/p> <p>SPRING\/SUMMER (Mar - Aug)<\/p> <p>As the city warms up we play four times a week. Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside as a backup.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather. Our main location is Riverside Park with Morningside as a backup.<\/p> <p>There are two days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (108th and West End - Big Soccer Field)<br\/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (108th and West End - Big Soccer Field)<br\/>*Tuesdays\/Thursdays at 6pm games don't last long due to decreasing sunlight.<\/p> <p>FALL (Sep - Oct)<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Morningside Park (110th and Manhattan Ave)<br\/>- Sundays at 4pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 5:30pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Thursdays at 5:30pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<\/p>",

There are &lt;a&gt;multiple games&lt;\/a&gt; going on at once, so getting involved in a game is &lt;a&gt;easy&lt;\/a&gt;.<\/p> <p><br\/>For those of you unfamiliar with the term, a Table Top RPG (Role &lt;a&gt;Playing&lt;\/a&gt; Game) is a type of game where the players create characters based on the \u00a0story\/system available and one person acts as a storyteller. Everyone interacts and works together to &lt;a&gt;create a story&lt;\/a&gt; and have a few laughs as well.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>New Rules for Signing Up:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>How to &lt;a&gt;sign up&lt;\/a&gt;: There will be at leas two &lt;a&gt;games running&lt;\/a&gt; each week.\u00a0 You will be able to see who is running, what games are being &lt;a&gt;played&lt;\/a&gt;, and who is &lt;a&gt;playing&lt;\/a&gt; below. There will be a total of six spots &lt;a&gt;open&lt;\/a&gt; in each game, so if a game has filled up you will not be able to join that game.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>When you &lt;a&gt;sign up&lt;\/a&gt;, leave a comment stating which game you would like to participate in and your name will be added to the roster. If you would like to leave a game or switch over to another game in &lt;a&gt;progress&lt;\/a&gt;, simply speak to Justin or Cat. They will let you know if there is &lt;a&gt;open&lt;\/a&gt; space to do so.<\/p> <p><br\/>If it is your first time &lt;a&gt;attending&lt;\/a&gt; a game, we have pre-made characters for you to &lt;a&gt;select&lt;\/a&gt; from. Beginning on your third RPG event, you may choose to make an original character for whatever game you're currently participating in.<\/p> <p><br\/>Can I run my own game?: If you would like to run your own game, please contact Justin or Cat to reserve a slot.<\/p> <p><br\/>Need Dice?: Please bring yours if you have some if you need extra I will provide some.<\/p> <p><b>Games Currently Running:<\/b><\/p> <p>Jutin: Full Steam Ahead\u00a0<\/p> <p>A new steampunk-inspired RPG by Justin.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nCat: Monster of the Week<\/p> <p>A game of investigating and fighting the things that go bump in the night.

Her work blurs the lines between art and technology, and spans a variety of media from sculpture to computer programs. After receiving a degree in glass from the Rhode Island School of Design, Ashley began to experiment with the pairing of artistic media and technology. The work she creates now is designed to be appreciated by both human and computer.<\/p> <p><br\/>She will be talking about her series Reverse Abstraction:<\/p> <p>The Reverse Abstraction series begins with a simple premise: that humans and computers perceive the world through different languages, and what is concrete for one is abstract for the other. The objects and shapes so familiar in human art can be neither perceived nor conceived by computers in their original form. Likewise, the codes that are so familiar to a computer are merely scattered symbols to human sensibility. The Reverse Abstraction series attempts to bridge the gap by constructing traditional objects in dual forms: as the classical object and as the hexadecimal and binary codes that represent them. Thus, abstraction becomes material, the meanings for humans and computers are united, and the duality is resolved.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n**MUST SIGN UP HERE TO ATTEND:** <a href=\"https:\/\/wwcnyc1.typeform.com\/to\/vJTp62\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wwcnyc1.typeform.com\/to\/vJTp62\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/wwcnyc1.typeform.com\/to\/vJTp62<\/a><\/a><\/p>",

This session is a\u00a0thorough\u00a0review of the SiSense product and a look under\u00a0the hood.<\/p> <p>In-Chip Technology is the latest development in database technology. \u00a0It combines the flexibility of in-memory based querying with the speed and robustness of OLAP cubes, without the hardware costs and difficult implementation of traditional solutions. Although only recently developed and released, In-Chip is quickly gaining \u00a0popularity due to its increased performance and ability to tackle complex and large data sets.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>PART 2: BI Implementation\u00a0Life-cycle\u00a0Comparison<\/b><\/p> <p>With a number of BI tools at our disposal, there still does not exist a BI silver bullet.

Bohemian, the Noho sister of a bar in the Nishiazabu district of Tokyo, is tucked into the back of a building that used to belong to Andy Warhol. To reach the front door, you pass through a hallway dubbed \u201cBasquiat Road\u201d (the artist died in his loft at this address). Inside is an apartmentlike, low-ceilinged room containing just 25 plush seats, including a couple of couches and a six-seat yellow pine bar. The white-walled room is Zen simplicity, from the back bar made of tatami mats to a diorama-like mini Zen garden built into one wall to a central skylight that facilitates the art of \u201ctsukimi sake\u201d (moonlight boozin\u2019). Bartenders serve a mix of signature and classic Asian and American cocktails, plying their craft with such precision that each time they present a drink, they shine a spotlight on it. Kiyo Shinoki, formerly the executive chef at Chanto, tells us Bohemian is more of a restaurant in the evening. He serves a mix of American, French, and Japanese small plates (everything from a burger with homemade pickles to short rib sashimi), and then later in the night, until 2am, the space takes on a lounge vibe, with bossa nova, jazz, and Japanese music. As with the Tokyo original that\u2019s hidden behind a house, there isn\u2019t any standing room, just seating at a row of low-to-the-ground two-tops and a couple of couches. In fact, Shinoki says he wants to maintain a maximum 60 percent capacity.<\/p> <p><b>MENU:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Dinner Menu 1<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/y2BTWUqsNg6xNYppqH7nZg\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Dinner Menu 2<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/Hn4DX2L2A1zjX2f4hQDjiQ\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>RESTAURANT GALLERY:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Inside the restaurant<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/mJgZASG-c6nkAdC9_EF1kg\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0A hidden room inside the restaurant<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/Hew-Oovz5UEdXYNYGdzf7Q\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0The Bar<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/4jMx1Zn-7G-XhqghjiMksQ\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>FOOD GALLERY:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Seafood Paella<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/LBGsS3-UGxFTqpwuzCAGiw\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Branzino<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/-Dx3Pl4tfYA67vlOL-zG3g\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Oysters<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/5gFQkmLzL5s35dGy21kUew\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Washu Beef Short Rib Sashimi<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/5jtxiHzuaFLoJxevfJNxRQ\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Uni Croquette.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/KVIJRWB5GxsSEdDOB6pWVw\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Beef Tarter Flatbread<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/H2w5NHAPkA-uAMLNdpVzMw\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>RESTAURANT REVIEW:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/bohemian-restaurant-new-york\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/bohemian-restaurant-new-York\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/bohemian-restaurant-new-York<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.playearth.jp\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.playearth.jp<\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Disclaimer:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>END<\/p>",

Your objective throughout the night will be to get out of the rat race and into the fast track! In other words you have to find a way to get out of that 9-5 that we all dislike and step into the life you always wanted to live.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nHow do you get out of the race race you ask?<\/p> <p>Your total monthly passive income has to be higher than your total monthly expenses.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nCashflow 101 is an educational tool in board game format which aims to teach the players concepts of investing by having their money work for them in a risk free setting (play money) while simultaneously increasing financial\u00a0literacy and stressing the imperative nature of accountability.<\/p> <p><br\/>There are two stages to the game. In the first, \"the rat race\", the player aims to raise his or her character's passive income level to where it exceeds the character's expenses. The winner is determined in the second stage, \"the fast track\". To win, a player must get his or her character to buy their \"dream\" or accumulate an additional $50,000 in monthly cash flow.<\/p> <p>In place of \u201cscore cards\u201d, there are financial statements. The game requires the players to fill out their own financial statements so that they can see more clearly what is happening with their money. It generally shows how assets generate income and demonstrates that liabilities and 'doodads' are expenses.<\/p>",

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't open our door from 6:30 - 7 pm while meditation is in progress. Kindly refrain from ringing our buzzer during this time.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>",

This involves inspecting, dry cleaning, and repairing thousands of dresses a day.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\u00a0Making this possible is a custom warehouse management system which makes heavy use of Dropwizard and RabbitMQ. We'll focus on how switching to a loosely coupled architecture of services communicating asynchronously has not only improved the stability of RTR's warehouse software but also made some new product features much easier to build. We'll also discuss some of the pitfalls we've encountered and where we still need to improve.<\/p> <p><br\/>-Aki Yamada<\/p>",

Edwards, M.D.<\/p> <p>The topic for this week's discussion is Chapter 6<b> The Essence of the Rosicrucian Order's Teachings<\/b>.<\/p> <p>You can find the chapter here:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00SXH79N8\">Kindle<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/ni\/book\/spiritual-laws\/id943227416?l=en&amp;mt=11\">iBook<\/a><\/p> <p><b>About the Book<\/b><\/p> <p>God has created laws by which the universe is governed. Humanity has continued to set these laws into creative motion through thoughts, prayers, motives, intentions, voices, and beliefs.\u00a0These are the right tools. In this book the student will learn how to use them always for the good.<\/p> <p>Human beings are responsible for creating the good, the beautiful, and the true- all of which we desire to experience. But humans are also responsible for creating that which we do not desire to experience. However, being co-creators with God, the quality of our thoughts, beliefs, and intentions will determine and manifest our world. There is work to do, and those who are on the path with knowledge of God\u2019s attributes and God\u2019s laws, and with love and good will in their hearts, will do that work. This is your guide to put these concepts into practice in our troubled world today!<\/p> <p><b>All are Welcome!<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0<\/p>",

The incredible strength of carbon fiber comes from the long, continuous strands that carry load down the entire part. This is why space shuttles, rockets, and Formula 1 cars are constructed from continuous strand carbon. And it\u2019s how we print. Don\u2019t settle for plastic with a dash of chopped carbon fill. Longer is stronger.<\/p> <p>Now, you can 3D print parts reinforced with Carbon Fiber, Kevlar or Fiberglass right from your desktop. Nylon and ABS plastic are great for testing form and fit. However adding one of the other materials gives you a part that functions stronger than aluminum with no post processing necessary. You can also select pause points in your print to allow embedded components up to 10 micron accuracy.<\/p> <p>The Mark One Carbon Fiber 3D Printer by MarkForged uses proprietary \u201cEiger\u201d software. Very simple to use, Eiger runs in the browser of any computer that runs Google Chrome. Once you get your Mark One printer, you just login to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eiger.io\/signin\">eiger.io<\/a> and get started. There are no downloads and no hassles.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nSee\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/nationalinventors.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/nationalinventors.com<\/a> for more info.<\/p>",

After about 10 minutes of meditation, we will share the inspirational guidance that we receive.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Aside from sharing the message that we receive from the Holy Spirit, we don't talk during this meetup event. We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed. Only the mind is in need of healing.\" \u2014\"PSYCHOTHERAPY: Purpose, Process and Practice,\"Supplements to <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Join us for a beautiful summer evening in Hoboken, mostly\u00a0by the Hudson River.\u00a0But first we'll get a delicious and inexpensive dinner at world-famous Mamoun's Falafel.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/2\/c\/highres_263981772.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>The world-famous original Mamoun's on Macdougal St. in Greenwich Village<\/b><\/p> <p>Mamoun's Falafel is impossibly good and impossibly cheap.\u00a0Longtime New Yorkers can tell you about the\u00a0continual line streaming out of the place, at any time of day or night, from their original location on Macdougal Street in Greenwich Village. Founded in 1971 and featured in the book <b>1,000 Places To See Before You Die<\/b>, it is New York's original falafel restaurant.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/5\/4\/highres_263981812.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Hoboken Mamoun's!<\/b><\/p> <p>But did you know there are five other locations? (In the East Village, Hoboken, New Brunswick, New Haven and Princeton. I've been to them all. :) And in my considered opinion, the non-New York locations are even better than the original. Why? Larger menus (with more menu items) and more-and-better\u00a0seating space.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/5\/e\/highres_263981822.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>One item I particularly love that is unavailable in the New York locations is their \"Pickles\" (pickles, pickled turnips and olives) for $1.25. It's my favorite pickled dish anywhere in the world,\u00a0and it's a perfect accompaniment.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/4\/a\/highres_263981802.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Of course, what made Mamoun's a New York legend was their $2 falafel sandwiches (now $3.50). These are served to eager Macdougal Street patrons (who make a line out the door day and night). Mamoun's of course has the Middle Eastern standards: hummus, baba ghanouj, tabouli, plus lentil soup (so delicious!), grape leaves (my favorite grape leaves), spinach pie -- all perfectly made and all so inexpensive! Their side order of hummus, served with plentiful \"pita ends\", is just about a meal in itself and is only $2.00!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/8\/6\/highres_263981862.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>I love tamarind drinks - tamarind seed, sugar and water. They can be hard to find, but I have tasted several. Mamoun's is the best, and it's $1.85. Also $1.85: mint lemonade, mango juice, Mamoun's spiced tea (hot or cold).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/9\/a\/highres_263981882.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Vegan &amp; Vegetarian Warning: Mamoun's serves meat.<\/b> But they seem to be excellent at keeping and cooking their meat dishes separately. Generally speaking, all the dishes that seem like they should be vegan are vegan. But if you are a vegan, just double-check the vegan-ness of your order with the person you order from.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/a\/4\/highres_263981892.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>While this Hoboken location has sit-down tables, there is no waiter service.\u00a0You order your food at the back of the restaurant, and then bring it yourself to your own\u00a0table. Mention to the person\u00a0who takes your order\u00a0any dietary requirements you have -- and in particular that you are a vegetarian or vegan.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/c\/c\/highres_263981932.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Hoboken is known and loved for its outstanding views of the Hudson River and New York City. Walking along the Hudson in Hoboken is a summertime pleasure not-to-be-missed.\u00a0 Our group will be strolling beside the Hudson River before and after Stop Two on our itinerary, The W Hotel Hoboken (itself on the Hudson).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/c\/2\/highres_263981922.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>If you've never been to The W Hotel Hoboken, you'll be tempted to say \"THIS is Hoboken?\"\u00a0The hotel is particularly beautiful and elegant.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/a\/e\/highres_263981902.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The W Hotel is located on River and 3rd Streets, directly across from the Hudson River,\u00a0and has stunning\u00a0river views. It's a beautiful place to relax and have drinks with friends, and is an easy walk from Mamoun's.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/e\/0\/highres_263981952.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>On our way from Mamoun's to the W Hotel, we will take a beautiful and leisurely stroll on the Hudson River. That stroll will include a visit to a park and pier that juts out onto the Hudson River. It is a magnificent place to relax on a summer evening, and enjoy the river breezes and stunning Manhattan views.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/f\/4\/highres_263981972.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Train Directions from Manhattan: Take the PATH train to Hoboken.<\/b> From the Hoboken PATH train station, walk to the corner of Washington St. &amp; 5th Street. Mamoun's is almost on the corner. (If you haven't been to Hoboken before, you should look on Google Maps first to see where this all is. The walk is a little under a mile, I would say. It's a nice walk down Washington Street, and it will be quite an experience if you haven't done it before.)<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/e\/a\/highres_263981962.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join us as we go from the incredibly cheap -- and so delicious! -- to the beautifully upscale.

        "description": "<p>This talk will cover various aspects of Logic Programming. We examine Logic Programming in the contexts of Programming Languages, Mathematical Logic and Machine Learning.<\/p> <p>We will we start with an introduction to Prolog and metaprogramming in Prolog. We will also discuss how miniKanren and Core.Logic differ from Prolog while maintaining the paradigms of logic programming.<\/p> <p>We will then cover the Unification Algorithm in depth and examine the mathematical motivations which are rooted in Skolem Normal Form. We will describe the process of converting a statement in first order logic to clausal form logic. We will also discuss the applications of the Unification Algorithm to automated\u00a0theorem proving and type inferencing.<\/p> <p>Finally we will look at the role of Prolog in the context of Machine Learning. This is known as Inductive Logic Programming. In that context we will briefly review Decision Tree Learning and it's relationship to ILP. We will then examine\u00a0Sequential Covering Algorithms for learning clauses in Propositional Calculus and then the more general \u00a0FOIL algorithm for learning sets of Horn clauses in First Order Predicate Calculus. Examples will be given in both Common Lisp and Clojure for these algorithms.<\/p> <p>Pierre de Lacaze has over 20 years\u2019 experience with Lisp and AI based technologies. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science and a Master\u2019s Degree in Computer Science. He is one of the Director's of LispNYC.org and is currently a Senior Developer at Shareablee.<\/p> <p>Pizza and beer will be generously provided by Shareablee.<\/p> <p>Links will be provided shortly.<\/p>",

Pranayam [breathing exercises] and kriyas [kundalini yoga set] or asanas are used to prepare the body and mind for a deeper effect of the gong bath.<\/p> <p>Gong Yoga has profound healing abilities. Immediate effects are common, since blood circulation is increased to bring in fresh nutrients, and will continue healing for days after the class.<\/p> <p>Students participating in multiple gong classes accumulate the most healing benefits. Recommended for releasing stress, clearing negative thought patterns and strengthening the nervous system.<\/p> <p>Eat lightly two hours prior to the session.<\/p> <p>Kundalini Yoga, as taught by Yogi Bhajan, is based upon the sound current, the power of word and mantra, and the vibration of the infinite. This primal sound is best represented by the sound of the Gong itself.<\/p> <p>\u201cThere is only one thing that can supersede and command the human mind \u2013 the sound of the Gong. It is the first sound of the Universe. It is the basic creative sound\u201d.

All guests will receive a 1 week complimentary guest pass to LA Fitness Staten Island.<br\/>This revolutionary cardio-based total-body conditioning program is based on the principles of MAX interval training. INSANITY pushes the participants to new training heights, resulting in more calories burned, faster results and more efficient metabolism. This interval training is the pinnacle of cardio training. You don't have to be in extreme shape - levels of each exercise are provided.<br\/>Insanity's not your traditional interval workout. It replaces traditional moderate-intensity exercise with maximum-intensity exercise, and trades short intervals of intensity for short periods of rest. The secret? Long periods of explosive intensity. You\u2019ll do cardio and plyometric drills with intervals of strength, power, resistance, and core training. With Insanity, you can burn up to 1,000 calories in an hour. Participants experience faster increases in cardiovascular fitness and burn carbohydrates and fat more efficiently.<\/p> <p>Class Description:<br\/>PLYOMETRICS for insane legs and gluts, UPPER BODY RESISTANCE for sculpted arms, shoulders, chest, and back. PURE CARDIO for crazy fat burn and CARDIO ABS with intensive core work so you can get awesome abs. 50 minutes: All Levels Welcome!<br\/>\u2606\u2606\u2606$10.00 for a limited time only\u2606\u2606\u2606<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

I have been throwing this little life drawing party every week at a cozy bar in Brooklyn and am looking to find new people interested in what I am doing. I have amassed an amazing variety of experienced art models and burlesque performers who show up every Tuesday at 8:30 pm to pose. I put out crayons, colored pencils and paper but encourage everyone to bring their own drawing materials! Its a fantastic way to meet new people, a fun date night, or an enriching, non-boring night out with friends.<\/p> <p>We are located at 462 Union Avenue, right across the street from Kellogg's Diner on Metropolitan. Just a few steps from the L train at Lorimer and G train Metropolitan station.\u00a0<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Hi everyone,<\/p> <p>I'm excited to announce a great opportunity for the right crew. The Manhattan Holistic Chamber of Commerce has agreed to allow our group to film their open house event June 10th from 11a-1p and ultimately make a short video out of it.<\/p> <p>This event is all about health and wellness, and promoting a holistic approach to our daily lives. In addition, and of interest to our members, having the opportunity to network with a Chamber of Commerce provides incredible opportunities when we deliver our polished and professional finished product.<\/p> <p>Therefore, I'm looking for shooters, editors, sound, motion graphics, and possibly lighting people for this gig. We can have a pre-planning meeting to discuss equipment and timing (the meeting has a rigid agenda down to the minute) and of course, since you will be representing our group and myself, I expect professionalism from all involved, including our attire. Not necessarily suits and ties, but a professional look, business casual works.<\/p> <p>Please let me know ASAP if you would like to be a part of this great opportunity, list your equipment, and how you can contribute to the shoot. We will arrive at 10:15 and have 45 minutes to set up our equipment for a prompt 11am start.<\/p> <p>Please let me know if you have any questions, and welcome aboard!<\/p> <p>Jordan<\/p>",

It is the brainchild of a couple of kids from Queens, who brought together a handful of different talents and personalities in order to create an efficient, diligent, and only semi-dysfunctional team.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Linute allows you to host events for your crew, discover new favorite places and interact with new &amp; old friends. You can create events to be published on your and your friends\u2019 Timelines, and control who sees your event by making it invite-only, private, or public.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Linute does all of the planning work for you. All events on your Timeline and Discover feeds happen within 24 hours, and then disappear. Everything you scroll upon is happening now\u2014without cluttering your inboxes.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Linute utilizes a clean, simple interface in order to help you find your next move without much effort on your part.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/linute-new-york-city\/id982739793?mt=8\">App Store<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/getlinute?fref=ts\">Facebook<\/a>\u00a0| <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/getlinute\">Twitter<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/getlinute\/\">Instagram<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/i172.photobucket.com\/albums\/w40\/Hadi_Rashid\/11066797_10155487295280105_1758755680970090827_n_zpsne6qaouj.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Nabeel Alamgir was born in Bangladesh, moved to Kuwait when he was 7 and to America 7 years after that. He learned English by watching movies, mostly Scorsese, and worked under the ethic instilled by his parents in order to excel in high school and get into Syracuse University as a pre-med student at 19 years old. This plan was how his father\u2014a cab driver in New York City\u2014wanted him to reach his full potential. Nabeel saw a different path.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Forfeiting his free ride to be free, Nabeel dropped out after a year and a half, straining the relationship with his father. The word <i>entrepreneur<\/i> did not exist in the Alamgir household. Golden Boy turned renegade, it was a fight against power\u2014totally foreign to the culture in which Nabeel grew up. There was a complete lack of clarity between the idea of disobedience and that of initiative.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Nabeel went from working for Apple at 17 years old to bussing at the flagship Bareburger, to finally getting a shot at Corporate. He put in many hours at the Corporate Bareburger building, starting first with only the company\u2019s Ping-Pong table as his workspace, constantly interrupted for the higher-ups\u2019 coffee requests.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Euripedes was Nabeel's mentor from when he was 17 years old, and continuously came through as a lifesaver. Through a series of promotions over two diligent years he became VP of marketing, a job in which he excels to date. When his best friend mused an idea about a spontaneous event planning app, Nabeel called upon his former Apple Genius experience to help turn that idea into a reality. Valuing the importance of team over technology, Nabeel dipped into many of his social circles and selected a variety of talents and personalities. He singlehandedly brought together the group of misfits who can only be described as a Dream Team.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Sun Choi studied B.A. in Fine Arts at Hong-Ik University, and Choi's recent artworks show her great interest on social issues and environmental problems. Specifically, she has used pig fat as her painting material to represent 2011 foot-and-mouth disease (FMC) in Korea. Arist Choi also applied and created works of art by using invisible materials such as breath, body heat, wind, smell, and other materials taken from social happenings not only in Korea but also surrounding countries. The artist believes that the artwork's value is no longer in an artist's genius or his\/her inviolable aura. She has been creating artworks which find its meaning through the communication and interaction with people.<\/p> <p>Born in the south of France, V\u00e9ronique Gambier started to paint on large scale canvases at the age of 12 under the guidance of French Master Pierre Pallut, developing a strong sense of color and abstraction. She attended L\u2019\u00e9cole des Beaux Arts de Toulon (College of Fine Art of Toulon) and L\u2019\u00e9cole des Beaux Art de Luminy (Luminy College of Fine Art) in Marseille. In the beginning of her career, Gambier chose to pursue a career in fashion, but later changed her career as a Graphic Designer. Finally, she decided to devote her time as a painter, and currently working and living as an artist in New York. Gambier\u2019s creative process is about exploring color, shape and texture for its distinct resonance to an emotion. She seeks to express tension on a canvas rather than harmony, movement rather than stillness.<\/p> <p>Daphne Ji Yeon Jang received B.A. in Sculpture from Ga Chon University.Through her video works, Jang is bringing new meaning to classical sculptures. Jang's artworks show sculptures as moving images in 3D computer space. She uses the classical sculptures that can be found in the museums and adds movement to form a moving sculpture with a new story and contemporary background or materials. Namely, she is giving lives to the sculptures which were once motionless and bringing them to the modern time. Through her moving sculpture video installations, Artist Jang hopes to share feeling of courage, trust, sacrifice, love, and compassion.<\/p> <p>Artist Dong Jin Jeon, who studied M.F.A. and B.F.A. in Fine Arts from Keimyoung University, uses 'draw' and 'repeat' for his main motifs in his artworks. Artist Jeon repeatly draw thin lines on a large canvas and creates a monochrome image. According to the artist, the repetitive drawing methiod is not accidental but intentional. He believes the painful repetitive actions are like a life of human that after he completed the work and overcame the movement of self-torture, it brings such a great catharsis. Artist Jeon stated: \"As a human devotes his or her life for the death, my work is also some repetition of permanent, unveiled procedure toward unknown ending.\"<\/p> <p>Andy H. Jung, who received M.F.A. in Photography from Pratt Institute in New York, illustrates desires of human in his photography. According to the artist, humans are animals of desire. Human's desire toward new and artificial things became the objects of our desire in the world, and even after they possess what they desired, they constantly looking for new objects. Jung's works of art try to connect tangible and man-made objects with his ethereal memories. Through his photography, the artist hope to communicate with both artificial object and the collective memories in a singular and unified image. Namely, he wishes to evoke a visceral connection between external world of humans and the internal world of human minds.<\/p> <p>Minso Kim received M.F.A.in Art &amp; Technology Studies from School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and her works of art depict the physical imprints of diverse human connectivity. According to the artist, her artwork is functioning at the center of poetics, translation, and technologies, and delivering crude feeling of text through manifesting the sounds of human language. Artist Kim has great interest on the limitation of language. She believes that although humans use language to deliver their feeling, sensation, and thoughts to one other, it is difficult to perfectly understand one's messages in language. Through the artwork. such as her recent works of art. Lost in Translation and A Letter to You, Kim is trying to represent the interaction between feeling and fact, subjective and objective views via languages.<\/p> <p>The opening reception and preview event will be open to public on Wednesday, June 10th from 6:00 P.M. to 8:00 P.M.<\/p>",

When you come in though all you to do is look for a pile of games to know where we are. The entrance to the \u00a0private space is located right past the coffee bar setup.<\/p> <p>Just a quick reminder not bring in outside food and to patronize any bar that hosts us. Check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bergn.com\">bergn.com<\/a> if you want to check out their food and drink menu; they have a great selection.<\/p> <p>HOW MUCH IS THIS EVENT?<\/p> <p>There's no admission fee, but there is a two drink minimum* which you will be expected to honor.<\/p> <p>* (or monetary equivalent in non-alcoholic purchases if you don't touch the stuff.)\u00a0<\/p> <p>WHAT TYPE OF GAMES ARE PLAYED?<\/p> <p>All types.

        "description": "<p>Earlier this year, the <a href=\"http:\/\/theknickerbocker.com\/\">Knickerbocker Hotel<\/a> re-opened in its original space at 42nd and Broadway. This classic Old New York venue, which once had its own secret door (which is still there!) in the 42nd Street subway station, had been shuttered since 1920. But the 1906 beaux arts building remained, serving as offices or fashion showrooms before being re-imagined and re-opened as a luxury hotel 95 years after its previous incarnation closed.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/d\/c\/d\/600_437591725.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe Knickerbocker Hotel bar was where the martini was invented. That in and of itself would be enough reason to pay the Knickerbocker a special visit. But June 10 is also a historic day for the hotel. For it was on this day in 1919 that Amory Blaine, the protagonist in F. Scott Fitzgerald's debut novel, \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/This-Side-Paradise-Scott-Fitzgerald\/dp\/1483990656\">This Side of Paradise<\/a>,\" famously drank away his sorrows in the Knickerbocker Hotel bar under the watchful eyes of Maxfield Parrish's Old King Cole, after Amory's girlfriend Rosalind Connage ended their budding relationship. The same Old King Cole mural now watches over patrons at the St. Regis Hotel bar farther uptown.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/d\/f\/e\/600_437591774.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nIt was a pivotal scene in the book and one of the most famous drinking binges in American literature. The scene was modeled after Fitzgerald's own life as his then-girlfriend Zelda Sayre had broken up with him in the summer of 1919 for the same reason that Rosalind dumped Amory: he wasn't successful enough and she didn't think he could offer her a financially secure, comfortable future. Fitzgerald, like Amory a recent graduate of Princeton, drank away the rest of the summer in New York, then returned to his hometown of St. Paul, Minnesota to write his debut novel. Scribner's bought the manuscript and published \"This Side of Paradise\" to much critical acclaim the following spring. The suddenly more successful Fitzgerald was able to resume his courtship with Zelda and they were married at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York on April 3, 1920, just a week after \"This Side of Paradise\" hit bookstores. As for Amory Blaine, you'll have to read the book to find out what happened to him.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/4\/a\/600_437591850.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nSo if Dublin can have Bloomsday (June 16) in honor of the Leopold Bloom character in Joyce's <i>Ulysses<\/i>, New York can honor Amory Blaine and F. Scott Fitzgerald on June 10, especially now that the site of one of the book's most iconic scenes has reopened.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/f\/3\/9\/600_437592089.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nWe'll have a reserved space at Charlie Palmer at the Knick on the 4th floor at the Knickerbocker Hotel. In the interest of full disclosure, this is not the original location of the Knickerbocker bar. As you can imagine, much has changed in a venue that just re-opened after 95 years. But it's still the same historic building, with an extensive cocktail menu and the bartenders can make the two drinks featured in the famous scene: the rye highball, which Amory drank, and the Bronx. We'll meet starting at 6:30 and plan a special toast to the unfortunate Amory Blaine at 8:20, the precise time his relationship with Rosalind ended.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/f\/8\/3\/600_437592163.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nSo come join us for this unique tribute to Old New York and one of America's greatest novelists. BTW, we are planning an F. Scott Fitzgerald's New York bar tour in September (in honor of Fitzgerald's 119th birthday) so stay tuned.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/f\/a\/4\/600_437592196.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

In this biweekly series, we\u2019ll explore classic introductory Buddhist books. Although we have \u201creading assignments\u201d, the meetings focus more on basic Buddhist teachings rather than strict discussions of the books. Our meetings are casual and informal; all levels of interest and experience are welcome. When possible, we\u2019ll have copies of the current book available at no cost.<\/p> <p>*** Right Now We\u2019re Reading: \u201cThe Dhammapada\u201d translated by Gil Fronsdal***<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dhammapada\">The Dhammpada<\/a> (Teachings of the Dharma) is one of the most popular, widely read, and most accessible of all Buddhist texts. The clear and direct teachings on key topics like meditation, mindfulness, ethics, and compassion are especially well-suited for anyone exploring basic Buddhist teachings.<\/p> <p>While there are many translations of the Dhammapada, we\u2019ve chosen to read the version by Gil Fronsdal, frequently cited as the best English version to date. The book is readily available in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shambhala.com\/the-dhammapada-1.html\">bookstores <\/a>and libraries. Furthermore, there are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.insightmeditationcenter.org\/books-articles\/dhammapada\/\">audio versions of all chapters<\/a> freely available from the Insight Meditation Center.<\/p> <p><b>For the June 10th, 2015 meeting, please read Chapters 10 through 12 (~9 pages). <\/b><\/p> <p>Discussion points include:<\/p> <p>-What does Buddhism say about ethics\/morality?<\/p> <p><br\/>-What are the Five Mindfulness Trainings (Precepts)?<\/p> <p><br\/>-What is impermanence?<\/p> <p>\n\n***<\/p> <p>Happy reading and we hope to see you soon!<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Out in the cold Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Rhode Island, lies the remains of what was once a feared and mighty hunter. Its's not a fish or shark, for that matter its not even a marine creature. It's what men feared the most when they went to sea aboard their vessel back in the World War II years. It's a German Submarine called a U-Boat. The U-853 was the last German submarine sunk in World War II. She was sunk with all hands just minutes before World War II ended. The once mighty hunter feared by all who put to sea, now lies in 130 feet of water off the coast of Block Island, Rhode Island, her grave marked only by a circle on the nautical charts, DANGER Unexploded Depth Charges, May 1945.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nCaptain Bill Palmer will show us his extensive research on this historical shipwreck and show an awesome video detailing the inside of this magnificent submarine.\u00a0 If time allows, we might even get to talk about the USS Bass which also lies in the waters of Block Island.\u00a0<\/p> <p>About the Speaker:<\/p> <p>Captain Palmer is a licensed Coast Guard Captain with over three decades of practical experience in New England waters. He runs his vessel , The\u00a0 Thunderfish (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thunderfishcharters.com\">www.thunderfishcharters.com<\/a>) out of Mystic Shipyards in CT, and is committed to providing high quality, reasonably priced adventure packages to the individual who dares to challenge the Ocean with a variety of Shipwreck tours and even Shark Cage Adventure Trips\u00a0<\/p> <p>He has over 30 years of experience diving wrecks along the eastern seaboard. As well as being a dive instructor specializing in advanced wreck diving, he is an avid historian and underwater videographer. He produces numerous videos on wrecks, wreck diving, and fishing. Some of his credits include C.P.T.V., Discovery Channel, A&amp;E, and Times Mirror. He is well known for his lectures and presentations around the east coast. He is an associate member of the Boston Sea Rovers and a member of the American Society of Oceanographers.\u00a0<\/p>",

When some say that hardware is \u201chard\u201d, our technology is here to show it doesn\u2019t need to be.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Building electronics has always been a compromise between cost, flexibility and time. \"<b>Squink\"<\/b> was created to provide all three, anywhere and to everyone.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>\"Squink\"<\/b> replaces the usual soldering operation with conductive glue, meaning even young students or makers who have not mastered the difficult skill of delicate SMD soldering can easily prototype electronics from a file. It prints on a variety of substrates - even flexible ones for all your new wearables ideas you been dreaming about. And it includes a 'pick n place' feature that allows \"<b>Squink\"<\/b> to place all your parts in the right place, in the proper orientation, the first time, every time. \u00a0Simplifying the process of building circuits and allowing you to focus more on other tasks while you wait for your personal circuit factory to produce your boards. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/4\/5\/6\/600_437177494.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/4\/6\/4\/600_437177508.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>-From an idea to a circuit \u2013 in minutes...<\/b><\/p> <p>You can access your <b>\"Squink\"<\/b> through USB, Ethernet cable, or Wifi. YES, wifi that's right. After you create or download your circuit design files (GERBER), upload them to \"<b>Squink\"<\/b> and it will walk you through a three step process. You can also use regular PNG files if you feel artistic!

        "description": "<p>It\u2019s the lesser-known half of that hyphenated region, Languedoc-Roussillon.<\/p> <p>Languedoc-Roussillon, in southern France, is often thought of as a single region, but the two areas are distinctly different.\u00a0 Languedoc is thoroughly French, its vineyards spread out over a broad coastal plain.\u00a0 Roussillon, which borders Spain, considers itself Catalan and grows vines in terraced vineyards in the Pyrenees foothills.\u00a0 Languedoc has long been synonymous with basic French table wine, while Roussillon has always been best known for fortified <i>vins doux naturels<\/i>\u2014French equivalents of port from the Banyuls and Maury appellations, and Muscat- and Grenache Blanc-based sweet wines from Rivesaltes.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The unfortified table wines of Roussillon are enjoying a higher reputation these days, largely thanks to an influx of new winemakers who recognized the potential of the region\u2019s schistous hillsides, which are not unlike those of Priorat across the border in Spain.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Unlike Languedoc, which has numerous appellations named after local villages, Roussillon AOCs for dry wines are limited to C\u00f4tes du Roussillon, C\u00f4tes du Roussillon-Villages, Collioure, and the recently created Maury Sec.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>C\u00f4tes du Roussillon<\/i> \u2013 This large appellation covers the eastern half of the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales, from the Mediterranean coast to the eastern edge of the Pyrenees mountains.\u00a0 Per AOC regulations, C\u00f4tes du Roussillon reds must be made from at least three different grape varieties, with Syrah and\/or Mourv\u00e8dre constituting at least 30 percent.\u00a0 Grenache is the most planted variety, and there\u2019s still a fair amount of less-favored Carignan (which cannot contribute more than 60 percent to the blend).\u00a0 The designation C\u00f4tes du Roussillon-Villages is reserved for (theoretically) superior wines of the region and is limited to the hilly northern third of Roussillon.\u00a0 Four villages are allowed to append their names to the appellation title.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p> <p>White wines constitute just 4 percent of production, yet they can be some of the region\u2019s most interesting wines, usually made from aromatic Grenache Blanc and Maccabeu (better known as Rioja\u2019s Viura grape), and often treated to oak aging.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>C\u00f4tes Catalanes<\/i> \u2013 This is a catch-all Vin de Pays\/IGP category that covers wines that do not adhere to C\u00f4tes du Roussillon regulations.\u00a0 This is not necessarily an indication of lesser quality\u2014a superior wine that contains fewer than three varieties or contains less than 30 percent Syrah\/Mourv\u00e8dre will be bottled as C\u00f4tes Catalanes.<\/p> <p><i>Collioure<\/i> \u2013 This is an attractive seaside town near the Spanish border that is best known as an artists\u2019 colony\u2014Matisse, Picasso, and Braque, among others, all spent time here.\u00a0 But it also produces a fairly rare red wine from the same vineyards that yield fortified Banyuls.\u00a0 Syrah, Grenache, and Mourv\u00e8dre (the last grown exclusively for the dry table wine) must make up 60 percent of the blend.\u00a0 Yields are low here, and there is a maximum alcohol level permitted (15 percent), perhaps an indication of the extreme ripeness achieved in this warm climate.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Maury Sec<\/i> \u2013 The northern Roussillon equivalent of Collioure is the new appellation Maury Sec, made in the same region and from the same grape varieties as sweet, fortified Maury.\u00a0 The dominant grape is Grenache, which must make up between 60 and 80 percent of the blend.<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll be trying a white C\u00f4tes du Roussillon, made from barrel-fermented Marsanne, Roussanne, and the more local Grenache Blanc and Maccabeu, and a red C\u00f4tes du Roussillon-Villages made by famed Rh\u00f4ne Valley winemaker Chapoutier.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Then under the C\u00f4tes Catalanes designation, we\u2019ll try a rustic white blend of Grenache Blanc, Maccabeu, and the little-known Carignan Blanc, and an all-Syrah red that is said to rival those of the northern Rh\u00f4ne.\u00a0 Plus another C\u00f4tes Catalanes made mostly from old-vines Grenache by California winery Orin Swift (of \u201cPrisoner\u201d fame\u2014they actually sold off the Prisoner label in order to invest in vineyards abroad, including this one in Roussillon).\u00a0 This will be an interesting exercise in blind tasting\u2014can we pick out the American-made bottle?\u00a0 (Jancis Robinson, while mostly praising the wine, complains that it tastes more of Napa than of Roussillon.)<\/p> <p>Then a well-priced Collioure, made organically from Grenache, Carignan, Mourv\u00e8dre, and Syrah, and an even greater bargain from Maury Sec\u2014a 95-rated Syrah\/Mourv\u00e8dre\/Grenache blend.\u00a0<\/p> <p>A Roussillon tasting would not be complete without including a <i>vin doux naturel<\/i>.\u00a0 As a bonus dessert wine, I\u2019ll be including a Rivesaltes Ambr\u00e9, a sweet, fortified Grenache Blanc that acquired its deep amber color from spending 14 years maturing in barrel.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll be meeting at Plates in Larchmont, which allows BYOB on Wednesday.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/platesonthepark.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/platesonthepark.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/platesonthepark.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>2012 Laguerre Le Ciste Blanc C\u00f4tes du Roussillon\u00a0 $17<\/b><\/p> <p><i>From Chambers Street Wines:<\/i>\u00a0 Eric Laguerre's \"Le Ciste,\" (named after a flowering bush in and around his vineyards) is certainly one of the most distinctive whites of the Roussillon. Grown in Eric's high-elevation vineyards on acidic soils of decomposed granite, the wine is made from Marsanne, Roussanne, Rolle (Vermentino), Grenache Blanc and Maccabeu. Yields are about 20 Hl\/Ha, harvesting is by hand in small baskets, fermentation (wild yeasts) and aging is in small barrels. Complex aromas of lemon oil, thyme, hay and white fruits\u2014a lovely melange with contributions from each variety. The plate is dense, stony and saline with herbal, citrus and white fruit flavors. The finish is long with mineral acids. Complex and distinctive as a young wine, this will be best with a few years of cellaring. Really a Grand Cru of the Roussillon and a great value!\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>2012 Domaine Vinci Coyade Vin de Pays des C\u00f4tes Catalanes\u00a0 $42<\/b><\/p> <p>75% Maccabeu, 15% Carignan Blanc, 10% Grenache Blanc.\u00a0 <i>From Kermit Lynch:<\/i>\u00a0 Olivier Varichon and Emmanuelle Vinci craft their fascinating wines here from what must be some of the most rustic vineyards on the planet. Their parcels lie at altitude on steep slopes where only gnarly old vines and the most resilient garrigue manage to dig roots into the rugged, rocky soil. The couple works their few small plots by hand, adamantly shunning chemical products anywhere near their prized vineyards. \u201cCoyade,\u201d a blend of the native Maccabeu with Grenache Blanc and the rare Carignan Blanc, delivers intense matchstick minerality backed by electric citrus and fleshy texture. Completing its malolactic fermentation and aging in neutral barrels, this substantial white deserves to be decanted.<\/p> <p><b>2013 Domaine de Bila-Haut Haut C\u00f4tes du Roussillon-Villages Latour de France Occultum Lapidem\u00a0 $32<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 94<\/i> \u2013 Ripe, voluptuous, and textured, the translucent purple-colored 2013 Cotes du Roussillon Villages Latour de France Occultum Lapidem comes from the schist soils around the village of Latour de France. A blend of 50% Syrah, 40% Grenache and 10% Carignan that was harvested on September 15 and aged all in concrete tanks, it\u2019s a fabulous wine that offers elegant notes of red and black raspberries, roasted herbs, pepper, melted licorice, and asphalt. These flow to a medium to full-bodied 2013 that has a full, layered mid-palate, beautiful fruit, fine tannin, and a classically focused, dry finish. It continues to freshen up in the glass, has integrated acidity and lots of class.<\/p> <p><b>2012 Gilles Troullier Vin de Pays des C\u00f4tes Catalanes De-La\u00a0 $35<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 94<\/i> \u2013A new cuv\u00e9e from Gilles, the 2012 C\u00f4tes Catalanes De-La (which translates to \"Here and There\") is sourced from 25-year-old Syrah vines and the granite soils of Lesquerde and Trevillach (which is right next to Boreal). It offers a gorgeous, Northern Rh\u00f4ne-like bouquet of blackberry, raspberry, violets, mint, and liquid rock that flows to a medium to full-bodied, elegant, and seamless feel on the palate. Possessing first-rate purity, integrated acidity and ample, polished tannin, it will shine for over a decade.<\/p> <p><b>2009 Orin Swift D66 Vin de Pays des C\u00f4tes Catalanes\u00a0 $40<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Jancis Robinson 15.5\/20\u00a0\u2013<\/i> 80% Grenache, 12% Carignan, and 8% Syrah from old vines with very low yields. Very dark, almost port-like look. Almost port-like taste too. SO sweet! Very clever winemaking indeed. The tannins are wonderfully supple until the slight acid and hit of schist on the end, and the fruit so luscious. But why does it have to taste so like a red from the Napa Valley rather than the Agly Valley? Local character seems smothered to me.<\/p> <p><b>2010 Traginer Collioure\u00a0 $22<\/b><\/p> <p><i>From Chambers Street Wines:<\/i>\u00a0 From Grenache, Carignan, Mourv\u00e8dre, and Syrah grown organically on the steep, schist vineyards of Domaine de Traginer, our favorite producer of Banyuls and Collioure. The 2010 Cuv\u00e9e Vieille Foudre shows deep aromas of ripe red currant and cherry liqueur, dried herbs, earth, and cocoa; the palate is dense and round but with a core of saline mineral under the ripe plum and cherry fruit, with earthy acidity in the long finish. Delicious now with a <i>daube Ni\u00e7oise<\/i> or steak, this should cellar beautifully, becoming wonderfully soft and complex, for five to ten years.<\/p> <p><b>2013 Chateau Saint-Roch Kerbuccio Maury Sec\u00a0 $22<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 95<\/i> \u2013 One of the most incredible values I've tasted in a long, long time, the jaw-dropping good 2013 Kerbuccio Maury Sec (this is a new appellation dedicated to dry wines from Maury) is 40% Syrah, 30% Mourv\u00e8dre, and 30% Grenache, all from the black schist soils of Maury, that spent eight months in concrete tank prior to being bottled unfiltered. Its inky purple color is followed by fabulous aromas and flavors of cr\u00e8me de cassis, violets, crushed rocks, and licorice. Full-bodied, seamless and incredibly textured, all while staying fresh and pure, it's an off-the-charts Roussillon that will drink well for 5-8 years, possibly longer.<\/p> <p><b>BONUS<\/b><\/p> <p><b>1999 Domaine Cazes Rivesaltes Ambr\u00e9\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 92<\/i> \u2013 Rendered entirely from Grenache Blanc, the 2013-bottled Cazes 1999 Rivesaltes Ambr\u00e9 offers a riveting nose of candied lemon rind, glazed pineapple, brown sugar, pork rind, toasted pecan, floral extracts, wood smoke, and ocean breeze. Incisively zest and citric, piquantly nutty, briny, and alkaline on its expansive and lusciously viscous palate, this supplies ample counterpoint to its undeniable sweetness, even as flavors of nougat, caramel, and honey emerge to prominence. There are nectarous purity and polish here as well as formidable complexity.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

Remove your name from the list if you are not planning to attend.<\/p> <p>Inclement weather cancels the event.<\/p> <p>If you have any questions, feel free to email the organizer.<\/p> <p>Thank you all for this great group!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>*Free for Hudson County residents. Those outside of Hudson County may play as a guest of the resident players to avoid a possible $10 fee to play.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Meeting place again at 120 Bay. Take Two of this meeting, with hopefully a larger, better organized group in a more organized setting.<\/p> <p>For our next meeting, with all the attention the presidential race is getting, I thought we would start off with a straw poll endorsement. This group is about Staten Island, but all politics is local, and organizing here in our hometown for a presidential candidate is no less important than our own local politics. The straw poll should only take a few minutes. Also perhaps a discussion on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Fast Track, and making sure all of our members are writing, e-mailing, and calling our elected representatives to demand they side with the American worker against the corporate elites and stop Fast Track and the TPP. Police brutality is also an issue of obvious concern, meeting right down the street from where Eric Garner was killed by out-of-control cops. Afterward I thought we would discuss some of the issues others brought up at our first meeting, in particular the destruction of Mount Manresa and if anyone has any ideas about how to stop it (already there has been significant demolition but it's not too late to save what is left and prevent 250 condos from being built there instead of the beautiful greenery that is there now). Any ideas about how to catch the attention of Mayor Bill de Blasio to intervene before it is too late are welcome. Also we have a bunch of new members so we are still in an introductory phase.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Hi all,<br\/>For June let's read Things We Set on Fire by Deborah Reed...<br\/>\"A series of tragedies brings Vivvie's young grandchildren into her custody, and her two estranged daughters back under one roof. Jackson, Vivvie\u2019s husband, was shot and killed thirty years ago, and the ramifications have splintered the family into their own isolated remembrances and recriminations. Sisters Elin and Kate fought mercilessly in childhood and have avoided each other for years. Elin seems like the last person to watch her sister convalesce after an attempted suicide. But Elin has her own reasons for coming to Kate's side and will soon discover Kate\u2019s own staggering needs.<\/p> <p>This deeply personal, hauntingly melancholy look at the damages families inflict on each other\u2014and the healing that only they can provide\u2014is filled with flinty, flawed, and complex people stumbling toward some kind of peace. Like Elizabeth Strout and Kazuo Ishiguro, Deborah Reed understands a story, and its inhabitants reveal themselves in the subtleties: the space between the thoughts, the sigh behind the smile, and the unreliable lies people tell themselves that ultimately reveal the deepest truths.\"<\/p>",

He who sows the seeds of murder and pain cannot reap joy and love\" [Pythagoras] How did we get here, to a\u00a0culture\u00a0that is so meat obsessed, yet cannot bare to see how our food is harvested. Where did we depart from our innate and childlike sense of compassion\u00a0toward animals.<\/p> <p>The World Peace Diet provides\u00a0a transformative perspective on the multiple consequences of the food choices we make (or are made for us)\u2014not just in terms of personal physical health, but also environmental health, cultural well-being, economic well-being, and alignment with our ethical and spiritual values.<\/p> <p>If you have read the book, this study group will be a good forum for sharing sections that meant something to you, seeking clarity on more challenging sections through open discussion, and sharing how you have been effected by your food choices.<\/p> <p>If you have not read the book but are an ethical and\u00a0environmentally compassionate individual, and would like to explore ways to live more in alignment with your values,\u00a0I think you will enjoy the discussion and be a valuable contributor to the deep discussions that will inevitably come from discussing the text.<\/p> <p>Remaining chapters will be discussed in the following weeks.<\/p>",

Resting on the upper edge of McCarren Park, the massive Spritzenhaus beckons day-trippers and neighbors alike with its spacious 110 ft bar, long communal benches, and seasonal sidewalk seating. The 25-deep tap list centers on German drafts and domestic craft brews, all of which can be found pouring from four different stations. That\u2019s a lot of beer, but Bavarian pretzels and wood-fired pizza soak it up admirably. Park proximity and open windows make for ideal Spring drinking, but when the weather\u2019s less than hospitable, thirsty visitors can sit by the brick fireplace and ponder deep thoughts, like which beer to get next.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nFact: Spritzenhaus means \"fire station\" in German.<\/p>",

Elisabeth Alione is convalescing in a hotel in rural France when she meets two men and another woman. The sophisticated dalliance among the four serves to obscure an underlying violence, which, when the curtain of civilization is drawn aside, reveals in her fellow guests a very contemporary, perhaps even new, form of insanity.<\/p>",

We will all have a chance to introduce ourselves and be accepted as Empaths. If you are not an Empath, but love someone who is, we would love to get to know you too!<\/p> <p>This is not about making anyone feel embarrassed or singled out. We just want to have the chance to know a little bit about one another so that we can show our appreciation for who you are! We realize, some may be shy, some may feel nervous, and some may experience social anxiety. Just know that this is a safe environment, where you will not be judged or condemned. We want you to feel accepted and appreciated.<\/p> <p>The best thing about this group, is that we do not encourage clicks or seclusion. We may gravitate towards certain individuals that we feel a strong connection with, but, we do not want to isolate anyone. So, be prepared to learn something about everyone.<\/p> <p>*Meals are not free. Please be prepared to pay for yourself.<\/p>",

The workout fuses cardio, Pilates, isometric movements, plyometrics and Isometric poses into a 45-minute series. Burn between 400 and 900+ calories per hour, strengthen and sculpt infrequently used muscles, and drum your way to a leaner, slimmer physique \u2013 all while rocking out to your favorite music!<\/p> <p>HIIT, as the name suggests, combines high-intensity, calorie-torching periods of activity with low-intensity recovery periods for an overall duration of as little as 10 minutes each session. Some studies have shown that HIIT burns up to nine times more fat than traditional cardiovascular exercise and keeps your metabolism elevated for more than 24 hours afterwards. This means you are going to keep burning calories long after you have finished exercising.<\/p> <p>Boot Camp Workout. This intense circuit keeps your heart rate up, burns calories, and tones your whole body. With these circuits we will use body weight exercises alternating with calisthenics.<\/p> <p>you will need to bring,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Yourself, Sneakers, comfortable clothes.<\/p> <p>At least one water bottle (trust me, you\u2019ll need it!) and a towel for all that sweat. If you have one, a heart rate monitor is an awesome fitness tool that instructors and students alike typically use to measure exercise intensity during classes.\u00a0<\/p> <p>You may want gloves, &amp; a Mat as we are going to get down and dirty, pullups, push ups, planks, knee tucks we are going to have some fun utilizing the swings and monkey bars in the play ground, so dress accordingly and get excited to have some fun while shaping up!!!.<\/p>",

Building Studies: An Archive of Jersey City Architecture is in Gallery 3.<\/p> <p>The student work was originally shown for one evening at a Jersey City Environmental Commission meeting. Now several local environmental groups are partnering with Rutgers to broaden opportunities to engage the public and to inspire greater input from citizens to City officials about the changing landscape of Jersey City.<\/p> <p><b>Reception and Viewing Hours<\/b><\/p> <p>An opening reception is set for Thursday, June 11, 2015, from 5-8 pm, at Casa Colombo, 380 Monmouth St, Jersey City. Eldad Tarmu, vibraphonist \/ composer, will be performing.<\/p> <p>The program schedule is as follows:<\/p> <p>5 pm\u00a0 Doors open for viewing exhibits in Gallery 2 and 3<\/p> <p>6 pm\u00a0 Music and refreshments in Gallery 2<\/p> <p>6:30\u00a0 Welcome from organizers in Gallery 2<\/p> <p>6:45 \u00a0Opening remarks by Rutgers curators<\/p> <p>7:30\u00a0 Questions and discussion<\/p> <p>Following the opening, the exhibits are viewable during regular museum hours, which are Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10am \u2013 3pm, and at additional special events and times to be scheduled over the summer. A closing reception is scheduled for Thursday evening, August 27. See Sustainable JC\u2019s website for updates on summer programming (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.SustainableJC.org\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.SustainableJC.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.SustainableJC.org<\/a><\/a>).<\/p> <p><b>Exhibit Details<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0 <b>Environmental Resources and Issues<\/b> is the outcome of an environmental resource study that resulted in maps showing the complex quilt of cultural, historic, civic, and natural resources of Jersey City.\u00a0 These maps, plus research and interviews, resulted in an analysis of Jersey City and its history.\u00a0 The analysis led to six sets of speculative design proposals that students developed to address issues such as pedestrian safety, transportation nodes, and environmental infrastructure.\u00a0These proposals focused on The Heights, Journal Square, Downtown Jersey City,\u00a0the West Side, and Greenville neighborhoods.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0<b>Building Studies<\/b> is one result of a study of seventeen landmark buildings in Jersey City. The exhibit is a set of detailed measured drawings, showing the four facades and, when possible, a generalized floor plan, for each building.\u00a0 In addition, three-dimensional studies allow for views of the buildings that highlight unique characteristics.<\/p> <p>Many of the buildings studied are listed on the State and\/or National Registers of Historic Places. These include the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal (1889), the only survivor of Jersey City\u2019s magnificent waterfront passenger rail terminals; Continental Can Company Complex (Canco Lofts), a factory-to-loft conversion project; Fairmount Apartments, an early-20th-century apartment building in the Arts and Crafts style; Hudson and Manhattan Powerhouse, the 1908 Romanesque Revival structure that once powered what is now the PATH; William J. Brennan Hudson County Courthouse, an early historic preservation success; Ionic House (Dr. William Barrow Mansion), an 1837 Greek Revival building; Loew\u2019s Theatre, the 1929 Baroque-style movie theatre; Old Bergen Reformed Church, an 1841 building that houses a congregation that has met since Dutch colonial days; Stanley Theatre, the massive, ornate 1928 movie theater; Van Wagenen (Apple Tree) House, the 1750 home in which General George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette were believed to have met.<\/p> <p>The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company Warehouse is not only on the State and National Registers, but is also a National Landmark.<\/p> <p>Other landmarks treated are Jersey City\u2019s 1889 City Hall; Goldman Sachs Tower, the state\u2019s tallest building when it was completed in 2004; the National Guard Armory, a beaux arts building completed in 1937; St. Anne\u2019s, a 1903 church; Temple Beth-El, the 1926 home of a liberal congregation that has met since the Civil War period; and New Jersey City University (NJCU) Arts and Sciences Building.<\/p> <p><b>Exhibit Curators and Sponsors<\/b><\/p> <p>This undergraduate student work was developed under the supervision of Rutgers University faculty Jean Marie Hartman, Ph.D., David C.

We have used this venue several times in the past and our turnouts are huge. There is a full service bar here and a standing\/sitting area around the roof. There is watress service and food is available here. Please bring your own cigars here. I do not know if they still sell cigars here because I don't see it on the menu. Cigarette &amp; cigar smoking allow here with no cutting fee. Aresky's Patroon is an upscale restaurant with several floors and of course a rooftop. Please have neat attire because when you walk thru the doors you get greeted by the managers. Don't give them a reason not to let you in. They will direct you to the stairway that leads to the roof. This place does get crowded but it is a lot of fun. In case of rain there is an overhead covering at the bar area and the rest of the place is cover with umbrellas. If you never smoked at a rooftop this is an experience you don't want to miss. Many of my members do bring guests here and everyone does have a good time.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Updated March 8th, 2015<\/p> <p>This is one of three sites\/listserves that promotes weekly games that have been going on for many many years. Stall counts are used on occasion, cleats are optional, boundaries are flexible, and all skill levels are welcome!<\/p> <p>There are two ways to stay in touch outside of Meetup.com:<\/p> <p>- Follow us on Twitter: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/nycultimate\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/nycultimate<\/a><br\/>- Like us on Facebook: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/nycultimate\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/nycultimate<\/a><\/p> <p>SPRING\/SUMMER (Mar - Aug)<\/p> <p>As the city warms up we play four times a week. Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside as a backup.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather. Our main location is Riverside Park with Morningside as a backup.<\/p> <p>There are two days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (108th and West End - Big Soccer Field)<br\/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (108th and West End - Big Soccer Field)<br\/>*Tuesdays\/Thursdays at 6pm games don't last long due to decreasing sunlight.<\/p> <p>FALL (Sep - Oct)<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Morningside Park (110th and Manhattan Ave)<br\/>- Sundays at 4pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 5:30pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Thursdays at 5:30pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<\/p>",

The REST API is Agile. The testing and planning are Agile. But alas, Data infrastructures certainly are not. Once an application matures, changing the shape or indexing scheme of data often forces at best a top-down planning exercise and at worst includes schema changes which force downtime.<\/p> <p><b>This talk will discuss solutions to some of the problems faced by software organizations as their products become successful and the data grows beyond the initial scope of the database, whether it starts out as relational SQL, NoSQL, or somewhere in-between.<\/b><\/p> <p>As the user base of a software system grows, the data infrastructure is forced to evolve to meet the needs of new features, increasing the variety of data with ever larger data volumes and higher query velocity. One thing we know about evolution is that it doesn't always take the simple path or produce simple results. Data systems often grow by adding technology: a little NoSQL here, a message queue there, a Hadoop cluster hiding in the corner. This growing complexity slows down product development and challenges technology teams to ramp up entirely new skillsets reactively.<\/p> <p>Is this your future or is this your today? Address these challenges, with a truly agile infrastructure that allows your organization to store, scale and access the data it needs.<\/p> <p>We will cover the concept of an 'Agile data infrastructure', able to handle everything from OLTP to real-time analytics to historical reporting. A truly Agile approach allows data to be accessed as an exact match to application requirements. As application needs change, an Agile platform must be able to respond rapidly and dynamically evolve the schema, data distribution and access patterns to support high scalability with high performance - while easing the burden of the application developer and database administrators.<\/p> <p>We will also highlight real a real-world use case from a large enterprise organization that was able to leverage an agile data approach to rapidly accelerate the pace of product development while actually simplifying operations.<\/p> <p>We'll make you a believer in the fundamental tenants of an agile big data infrastructure, namely that it must be Simple, it must be Scaleable, it must be Streaming, and, most importantly, it must be SQL.<\/p> <p><b>RSVP NOW on Meetup<\/b>: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.NYCSQL.com\/events\/222660497\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.NYCSQL.com\/events\/222660497\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.NYCSQL.com\/events\/222660497\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>Dan Lynn, CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.AgilData.com\">AgilData<\/a><\/b>, formerly CodeFutures Corporation, is an entrepreneur, technologist, teacher and technical leader with 14 years of experience in the software industry.

        "description": "<p>Hi Everyone!<\/p> <p>Just a quick update here on our New York Personal Development\/Life Hack co-collab meetup this Thursday.<\/p> <p>You can now RSVP within this group, and I STRONGLY recommend you attend if you are free - here's why:\u00a0<\/p> <p>-<a href=\"http:\/\/www.life-longlearner.com\/\">Scott Britton<\/a>\u00a0is speaking. He just recently released a single webinar that grossed him $11,000 in sales for his new course on Udemy. That's one marketing effort leading to 11k in sales for only ONE of his passive income products. He has several others, and is a true boss in specifically the course\/information product landscape.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The online course industry is growing fast, with Udemy getting $65 million more in funding recently, and Lynda.com being acquired by Linkedin for $1.5 billion. Seriously, you should get up to snuff on how to create passive income generating courses in your area of expertise, and learn from the best: Scott.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n-<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mfishbein.com\/\">Mike Fishbein<\/a>\u00a0is a master of selecting topics and releasing content to drive sales and traffic. He was so successful in creating passive income with his content generation and info products over the last few years that he was recently placed as the in-house content manager for Alpha UX. He's got tons of insight on how to quickly create smart, compelling, and relevant content content to drive sales. You do not want to miss his talk.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n*There will also be free drinks!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nSome more details of their talks on Thursday below:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.life-longlearner.com\/\">Scott Britton<\/a>\u00a0- How to Create Information Products to Grow Monetize Your Following<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Over the course of the last couple years, Scott has built up a 6 Figure Passive Income business. He spent time living in Brazil before coming back to the hustle-tastic chaos of NYC. He has numerous best selling products on Udemy and Amazon.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mfishbein.com\/\">Mike Fishbein<\/a>\u00a0- How to Use Blogging to Build a Following and Email List<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Mike has self-published over a dozen books on Amazon and has had his blog posts published on sites like Entrepreneur, Business Insider, and The Next Web.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nI will be in Rome, Italy during this meetup, but will be returning for the next one coming soon. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out, and I look forward to you having a good time and getting tons of knowledge from the event!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nBe awesome,\u00a0<\/p> <p>- Kean \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>",

His paintings capture both the tradition and uniqueness of Irish culture found in the different towns, pubs, counties in Ireland. Even a donkey and a lad at a pub, are given tribute - (though in fairness to the truth, the donkey was seen in a field; not in a pub.)<\/p> <p>Come share wine and light fare and listen as Daniel tells of his actual experiences behind the paintings.<\/p> <p>Program \/ talk starts at 7PM.<\/p> <p>For more info on the artist, the works and the gallery please visit www.transformgallery.com<\/p>",

Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She\u2019s even started to feel like she knows them. \u201cJess and Jason,\u201d she calls them. Their life\u2014as she sees it\u2014is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.<\/p> <p>And then she sees something shocking. It\u2019s only a minute until the train moves on, but it\u2019s enough. Now everything\u2019s changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?<\/p> <p>A compulsively readable, emotionally immersive, Hitchcockian thriller that draws comparisons to Gone Girl, The Silent Wife, or Before I Go to Sleep, this is an electrifying debut embraced by readers across markets and categories. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/22557272-the-girl-on-the-train#\">(<\/a><\/p>",

The REST API is Agile. The testing and planning are Agile. But alas, Data infrastructures certainly are not. Once an application matures, changing the shape or indexing scheme of data often forces at best a top-down planning exercise and at worst includes schema changes which force downtime.<\/p> <p><b>This talk will discuss solutions to some of the problems faced by software organizations as their products become successful and the data grows beyond the initial scope of the database, whether it starts out as relational SQL, NoSQL, or somewhere in-between.<\/b><\/p> <p>As the user base of a software system grows, the data infrastructure is forced to evolve to meet the needs of new features, increasing the variety of data with ever larger data volumes and higher query velocity. One thing we know about evolution is that it doesn't always take the simple path or produce simple results. Data systems often grow by adding technology: a little NoSQL here, a message queue there, a Hadoop cluster hiding in the corner. This growing complexity slows down product development and challenges technology teams to ramp up entirely new skillsets reactively.<\/p> <p>Is this your future or is this your today? Address these challenges, with a truly agile infrastructure that allows your organization to store, scale and access the data it needs.<\/p> <p>We will cover the concept of an 'Agile data infrastructure', able to handle everything from OLTP to real-time analytics to historical reporting. A truly Agile approach allows data to be accessed as an exact match to application requirements. As application needs change, an Agile platform must be able to respond rapidly and dynamically evolve the schema, data distribution and access patterns to support high scalability with high performance - while easing the burden of the application developer and database administrators.<\/p> <p>We will also highlight real a real-world use case from a large enterprise organization that was able to leverage an agile data approach to rapidly accelerate the pace of product development while actually simplifying operations.<\/p> <p>We'll make you a believer in the fundamental tenants of an agile big data infrastructure, namely that it must be Simple, it must be Scaleable, it must be Streaming, and, most importantly, it must be SQL.<\/p> <p><b>RSVP NOW on Meetup<\/b>: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nycsql.com\/events\/222660497\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.NYCSQL.com\/events\/222660497\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.NYCSQL.com\/events\/222660497\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>Dan Lynn, CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.agildata.com\/\">AgilData<\/a><\/b>, formerly CodeFutures Corporation, is an entrepreneur, technologist, teacher and technical leader with 14 years of experience in the software industry.

The REST API is Agile. The testing and planning are Agile. But alas, Data infrastructures certainly are not. Once an application matures, changing the shape or indexing scheme of data often forces at best a top-down planning exercise and at worst includes schema changes which force downtime.<\/p> <p><b>This talk will discuss solutions to some of the problems faced by software organizations as their products become successful and the data grows beyond the initial scope of the database, whether it starts out as relational SQL, NoSQL, or somewhere in-between.<\/b><\/p> <p>As the user base of a software system grows, the data infrastructure is forced to evolve to meet the needs of new features, increasing the variety of data with ever larger data volumes and higher query velocity. One thing we know about evolution is that it doesn't always take the simple path or produce simple results. Data systems often grow by adding technology: a little NoSQL here, a message queue there, a Hadoop cluster hiding in the corner. This growing complexity slows down product development and challenges technology teams to ramp up entirely new skillsets reactively.<\/p> <p>Is this your future or is this your today? Address these challenges, with a truly agile infrastructure that allows your organization to store, scale and access the data it needs.<\/p> <p>We will cover the concept of an 'Agile data infrastructure', able to handle everything from OLTP to real-time analytics to historical reporting. A truly Agile approach allows data to be accessed as an exact match to application requirements. As application needs change, an Agile platform must be able to respond rapidly and dynamically evolve the schema, data distribution and access patterns to support high scalability with high performance - while easing the burden of the application developer and database administrators.<\/p> <p>We will also highlight real a real-world use case from a large enterprise organization that was able to leverage an agile data approach to rapidly accelerate the pace of product development while actually simplifying operations.<\/p> <p>We'll make you a believer in the fundamental tenants of an agile big data infrastructure, namely that it must be Simple, it must be Scaleable, it must be Streaming, and, most importantly, it must be SQL.<\/p> <p><b>RSVP NOW on Meetup<\/b>: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.NYCSQL.com\/events\/222660497\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.NYCSQL.com\/events\/222660497\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.NYCSQL.com\/events\/222660497\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>Dan Lynn, CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.AgilData.com\">AgilData<\/a><\/b>, formerly CodeFutures Corporation, is an entrepreneur, technologist, teacher and technical leader with 14 years of experience in the software industry.

        "description": "<p>Spring is here, and Thursday night runs are back!<\/p> <p>This run starts at the \"Wild Duck Pond\" area of the Saddle River County Park in Ridgewood. We will start at the beginning of the mile markers which is near the exit, not near the entrance. There's parking close to the beginning of the path. If you cannot park in the lot nearest the beginning of the path, you'll need to reenter the park and park in the next closest lot. The driving area of the park is U-shaped so to get to the parking lot closest to the start of the run, you essentially drive around the \"U\" and approach the exit to the last lot on the right (by the dog park).<\/p> <p>We will start at the \"Wild Duck Pond Area\" and will turn around at some point. If you'd like to run additional miles, you are certainly more than welcome to do so as the mile markers make it simple to track your distance. Depending on the turnout we sometimes break off into little groups of two or three people, each of which may go at slightly different paces and\/or distances. Regardless, if you wish to run at a slower pace, I am more than happy to run with you at your preferred pace. Nobody gets left in the dust. This is a fun run, not a competition.<\/p> <p>For those who wish to stick around after the run, we may get together at (insert favorite Ridgewood hot spot here) to relax, catch up, and share some laughs. When we do this, we usually get to the restaurant between 7:30 and 7:45. If anyone cares to join us that didn't come to the run, you are certainly welcome.<\/p> <p>We will run rain or shine, hot or cold. If you RSVP \"Yes\", please do your best to be on time as we'll only wait a couple of minutes past 6:30 PM to get rolling. If you have questions, comments, or doubts, feel free to email me. Looking forward to seeing you on Thursday.<\/p>",

The goal of this presentation is to move beyond slide-sized examples of streams and lambdas, and to show how to build a fully working end-to-end application using just the core libraries available in the latest version of Java.<\/p> <p>In this session, Trisha will build a Java 8 application live. This application will consume a real-time feed of high velocity data, contain services that make sense of the data, and present it in a JavaFX dashboard. Along the way, we\u2019ll encounter Java 8 streams, lambdas, new ways of working with collections, and probably bump into the new date and time API.<\/p> <p><b>Building Microservices in Java - @crichardson<\/b><\/p> <p>In this talk you will learn about a modern way of designing applications that\u2019s very different from the traditional approach of building monolithic applications.We will talk about what\u00a0microservices are, its architecture, it\u2019s benefits and drawbacks. We will describe event sourcing and how it\u2019s an extremely useful persistence mechanism for persisting functional domain objects in a microservices architecture.<\/p> <p>Chris Richardson is a developer and architect. He is a Java Champion, a JavaOne rock star and the author of POJOs in Action, which describes how to build enterprise Java applications with POJOs and frameworks such as Spring and Hibernate. Chris is also the founder of the original CloudFoundry.com, an early Java PaaS for Amazon EC2.

Co-produced\/Co-directed by Deb Ellis and Denis Meuller (directors of Howard Zinn: You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train), The FBI's War on Black America looks at a dark period in our country's history. The film is a documentary exploration of the lives and deaths of people targeted by the US government's COINTELPRO program, an FBI launched program aimed against organized efforts by African-Americans to gain rights guaranteed by our constitution. Includes both archival footage and contemporary interviews with people involved in the movement.<\/p> <p>The FBI's War on Black America offers a thought provoking look at a government-sanctioned conspiracy, the FBI's counter intelligence program known as Cointelpro. This documentary establishes historical perspective on the measures initiated by J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI which aimed to discredit black political figures and forces of the late 1960's and early 1970's.<\/p>",

The boards and managers under attack often fire back stating that the activist shareholder is only, like the corporate raiders of the 80s, interested in a quick buck by leaving the company in worse shape upon sale of the investment.<\/p> <p>In this session we will discuss activist shareholders, what they are, how they operate and if indeed they are creating better companies while making their investors richer.<\/p> <p>The session speaker is Jan Simon,\u00a0Assistant Professor\u00a0of\u00a0 Financial Management at IESE Business School.

Our mind is impossible to control, and therefore we experience problems and difficulties. However, in this series, we will discover that our mind has vast potential, and is capable of limitless love, wisdom and joy. We will gain experience of the meditation, called clarity of mind, that helps us to connect to this potential. This practice creates the causes and conditions for us to experience a special bliss of concentration.<\/p>",

Description below. See you on June 11th!<\/p> <p>\n\n\n-Kiran<\/p> <p><b>The Circle (from Amazon.com)<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/The-Circle-Dave-Eggers\/dp\/0345807294\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/The-Circle-Dave-Eggers\/dp\/0345807294<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>When Mae Holland is hired to work for the Circle, the world\u2019s most powerful internet company, she feels she\u2019s been given the opportunity of a lifetime. The Circle, run out of a sprawling California campus, links users\u2019 personal emails, social media, banking, and purchasing with their universal operating system, resulting in one online identity and a new age of civility and transparency. As Mae tours the open-plan office spaces, the towering glass dining facilities, the cozy dorms for those who spend nights at work, she is thrilled with the company\u2019s modernity and activity. There are parties that last through the night, there are famous musicians playing on the lawn, there are athletic activities and clubs and brunches, and even an aquarium of rare fish retrieved from the Marianas Trench by the CEO. Mae can\u2019t believe her luck, her great fortune to work for the most influential company in the world\u2014even as life beyond the campus grows distant, even as a strange encounter with a colleague leaves her shaken, even as her role at the Circle becomes increasingly public. What begins as the captivating story of one woman\u2019s ambition and idealism soon becomes a heart-racing novel of suspense, raising questions about memory, history, privacy, democracy, and the limits of human knowledge.<\/p>",

If you have a bike, make sure you have a lock because you'll have to keep your bike outside the track area.<\/p> <p>If you feel uncomfortable leaving your personal belongings at the track, you can drop them off at Ace Bar (531 East 5th Street between A and B)\u00a0-- ask for Justin or Charlo and tell them you run with the team. \u00a0They will store our belongings for us.\u00a0\u00a0***Please note that they will not let you in without your ID so please bring that with you to the track. \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.acebar.com\/about.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.acebar.com\/about.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.acebar.com\/about.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>See you there -- and please contact a Whippet captain if you have any questions!<\/p>",

If you're looking for a particular event or events within a particular group, use the standard [Events](\/meetup_api\/docs\/2\/events\/) method.",
