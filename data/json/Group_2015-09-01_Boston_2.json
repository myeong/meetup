Inner city nightscapes will be as much part of our portfolio, as will be dark sky star, astro-landscape and Milky Way shoots or light painting opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>Most events will be free (no special fees beyond membership dues), membership dues will cover Meetup.com costs, minor group expenses and promotional means, invited lectures and trip organization expenses. Some events, such as field trips, may incur further cost, as announced in those meetups. You can sign up for free and attend one meetup to see if this is for you, but you are expected to pay dues if you continue membership. Limited attendance meetups are only for paid members. Note that this is the only continuously active night photography meetup in New England, we average one photo shoot every ~10 days, one meetup every week, and even keep it alive and going throughout the winter. Browse our \"past meetups\" to see what we have been doing.<\/p>\n<p>Night photography is exciting, presents the world in a truly different light and is serene and calming in many ways. However, it is also very different from daytime shooting, sometimes physically taxing and requires to watch out for yourself and others. The meetups here will always be conducted with adult and mature members, who provide safety through numbers, but you will always be responsible for your own safety.<\/p>\n<p>Before you start browsing around, please take a look at the MORE-POLLS in the menu and let us know your preferences and then please review the DISCUSSIONS, also in the menu, for various resources and some pointers on equipment, safety, attendance and membership rules.<\/p>\n<p>We are looking forward to seizing the night with you!<\/p>\n<p>J\u00fcrgen, GBNP Organizer<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-71.4599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/d\/b\/highres_438115259.jpeg","photo_id":438115259,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/d\/b\/600_438115259.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/d\/b\/thumb_438115259.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":22520231,"name":"Jurgen M Lobert"},"members":351,"name":"Greater Boston Night Photographers","id":10355952,"state":"MA","urlname":"GBNight","category":{"name":"photography","id":27,"shortname":"photography"},"lat":42.25,"who":"Night Owls"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Dracut","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1380035404000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"movies","name":"Watching Movies","id":1201},{"urlkey":"cardmaking","name":"Card Making","id":6669},{"urlkey":"craftswap","name":"Crafts","id":10099},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"movie-nights","name":"Movie Nights","id":15940},{"urlkey":"girls-night-out","name":"Girls' Night Out","id":16550},{"urlkey":"dinner-and-a-movie","name":"Dinner and a Movie","id":23778},{"urlkey":"handmade-cards","name":"Handmade Cards","id":24016},{"urlkey":"20-somethings","name":"20 somethings","id":50188},{"urlkey":"womens-social-30-40","name":"Women's Social 30-40","id":778072}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Dracut-Area-Ladies-Movie-Nights\/","rating":4.63,"description":"<p>This is a group for anyone who is interested in meeting new people or just having fun while participating in social activities: watching movies, bowling, going out to dinners, card making, and more.

Since then, we've grown dramatically (close to 200 members at the time of this writing) and we have Meetup events to play all sorts of stuff. We're open to anyone with a good attitude and an interest in strategic tabletop gaming -- though being the sort of person not scared off by rulebooks with more than eight pages doesn't hurt.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p><b>WHAT DO WE DO?<\/b><\/p>\n<br>\n<p>In addition to an event almost every Wednesday in Porter Square, Cambridge, we periodically host get-togethers to play games we're interested in at various places -- time and availability permitting. All of our events are free and open to anyone who's interested unless otherwise noted. Newcomers are always welcome at our events; you don't need to be an expert in the games we play. A good attitude and a willingness to learn is all that is necessary.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>We have a once-per-month session of 18XX games, and a kinda-sorta-once-per-month session of multi-player wargames. Apart from the longer time commitment, these events are like the others; everyone is welcome, including newcomers willing to learn the ropes.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>We also have running online competitions for the games <b>Brass <\/b>and <b>Through The Ages<\/b>. Newcomers are welcome to be a part of these as well, and you can play them from the convenience of your own homes.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p><b>WHERE DO WE MEET?<\/b><\/p>\n<br>\n<p>We're a pretty urban lot, so the vast majority of our events are in the Boston\/Cambridge\/Somerville\/Watertown\/Brookline\/Newton area. If this area is inconvenient for you, you are welcome to suggest an event for a venue more convenient for you; we just can't guarantee you'll get a big turnout.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p><b>WHAT IS A \"CUBE CARTEL GAME?\"<\/b><\/p>\n<br>\n<p>Basically, it's what you make of it.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>We started out as a group to get together and play \"heavier\" examples of \"Euro\" (or \"German-style\") board games (think <b>Agricola <\/b>or <b>Age of Steam<\/b>) and that is still probably the majority of what we play. But, as mentioned, we also play some 18xx (complex, nasty \"business\" games with a railroad theme, like <b>1830: Railroads and Robber Barons<\/b>) and some wargames (especially GMT's card-based wargames, like <b>Twilight Struggle<\/b> and <b>Virgin Queen<\/b>).<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>What we don't play much of: classic strategy games (like <b>Chess<\/b>, <b>Go <\/b>or <b>Mancala<\/b>), super-popular mass-market games (like <b>Monopoly<\/b>, <b>Risk <\/b>or <b>Clue<\/b>), traditional card games (like <b>Poker<\/b>, <b>Scopa <\/b>or <b>Bridge<\/b>), role-playing games (like <b>Dungeons and Dragons<\/b>) and collectible card games (like <b>Magic: The Gathering<\/b>). There are people in our group that like these sorts of games, and no one's going to give you a noogie if you suggest playing them, but they're not the focus of the group and are thus unlikely to make it to the table. There are some excellent local Meetups if you're interested in any of these.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>In the end, we're less interested in drawing a bright-line distinction between what is and what is not a Cube Cartel Game than we are in playing what we like. The real purpose of this group is to be a sort of \"safe space\" where no one's going to look at you like an uberdork for pulling out your copy of<b> Le Havre <\/b>or <b>Chicago Express<\/b>.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Thanks for checking us out.

Borne from a collaboration between the Helix Bioscience Institute-HBI (www.helixbioscience.org) and Science Shaping Our World-SHOW (www.scienceshapingourworld.com), Biology and the \"Computer after Dark\" seeks to provide a venue for a diverse and innovative gathering of individuals interested in the amazing potential that exists within multidisciplinary groups with the desire to bring about positive change. In a business casual setting, old friends and new, can gather to network, share their ideas, pose challenges, raise a toast, tell a joke, and share in the group camaraderie. Despite our many \u201ctouch points\u201d that allow us to be virtually connected 24\/7, we often find ourselves more disconnected from each other than ever before. In the hyperfast pace of our daily lives, we are awash in an ever-increasing fog of noise and distraction that can obscure those things most important to us. Through this meetup we seek to do exactly that \u201cmeetup\", connect, share, and create a rich \"physical network\" of colleagues and friends that can serve to enrich our professional as well as personal lives. With that I invite you to joins us for an evening of intellectual stimulation, good food, great company, and beer!<\/p>","lon":-71.1299972534,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/4\/2\/highres_343737922.jpeg","photo_id":343737922,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/4\/2\/600_343737922.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/4\/2\/thumb_343737922.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":123814962,"name":"SteveM"},"members":41,"name":"Biology and the Computer after Dark","id":11462562,"state":"MA","urlname":"Biology-and-the-Computer-after-Dark","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Friends"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1387327867000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"computer-club","name":"Computer club","id":15176},{"urlkey":"computer","name":"Computers","id":15225},{"urlkey":"computers-and-photography","name":"Computers and Photography","id":15370},{"urlkey":"computer-training","name":"Computer Training","id":32688},{"urlkey":"macintosh-computer-users","name":"Macintosh Computer Users","id":80614}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Computer-Forum-Meet-Up-For-Beginners-to-Buffs\/","rating":4.42,"description":"<p>This is a group for anyone interested in helping beginners fix and solve problems they run into being a Computer User.

Women on their own bikes were few and far between, and the experience of meeting and riding with one another brought strength, friendship\u00a0and knowledge. From this experience evolved our basic philosophy: to enjoy\u00a0safe, noncompetitive riding with other women motorcyclists. Although most of our members are based in Metro-Boston, we also come from greater New England,\u00a0 New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and as far away as Colorado.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n Our activities can include picnics, camping trips, bowling, movies, leading parades, maintenance clinics, motorcycle safety courses,\u00a0 fund-raisers and spontaneous rides to just about anywhere. All members are encouraged to develop and\u00a0participate in group events. We have several official rides\u00a0per year: 2 Novice Rides (Spring\/Late Summer), the Benefit Run (May), the Provincetown Run (July\/August), the\u00a0Berkshire Run (September\/October) and we lead the Lesbian and Gay Pride Parade in June. Some of our rides are exclusively for members and prospects only. Additional rides may be announced in the club newsletter or organized informally.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n If you don't know any of us yet, come meet us!

Our practice is 90 minutes of traditional Japanese karate with direct lineage to Gichin Funakoshi and includes kihon, kumite and kata. Practitioners of all levels are welcome. You will receive the highest caliber instruction. Come experience Boston\u2019s best kept secret!<\/p>\n<p>Practice is on Mondays and Thursdays from 7:15 \u2013 9.00 P.M. and Saturdays from 10:15 A.M. to Noon.<\/p>\n<p>Karate-do is the Way of the Empty Hand. It is derived from the ancient Okinawan fighting style and heavily influenced by the Chinese martial arts. The style of karate we practice is the traditional Shotokan as practiced from the time of Gichin Funakoshi. We are affiliated with Shotokan Karate of America (SKA).<\/p>\n<p>Master Gichin Funakoshi introduced karate-do to mainland Japan in 1916. He had been initiated into all the major Okinawan karate methods and taught a synthesis of the Okinawan styles as a total discipline. This method became known as Shotokan. Because of the great popularity of the style in Japan and, later, around the world, Funakoshi is widely considered to be the \u201cfather of modern karate-do. Aside from creating Shotokan karate and introducing it to Japan and the world, Funakoshi Sensei also wrote several books, one of which is \u201cKarate-Do Kyohan\u201d - The Master Text, which is the \u201chandbook\u201d of Shotokan. The original Japanese text of Karate-Do Kyohan was translated into English by Tsutomu Ohshima in 1973.<\/p>\n<p>We practice Shotokan karate in the traditional manner for the development of mind, body, and spirit. This art form has been passed down from teachers to students in an unbroken line from Funakoshi Sensei himself to Ohshima Sensei to us. We believe it is the responsibility of each practitioner to learn and practice the techniques correctly so that the tradition is preserved and can be passed on intact to the next generation.<\/p>\n<p>Shotokan Karate of America is a national nonprofit organization that has been teaching traditional karate-do in the United States since 1955. SKA was founded and is still led by Tsutomu Ohshima, who is one of Master Funakoshi Sensei\u2019s last direct pupils. In 1955 Mr. Ohshima came to the United States and was the first person to teach karate to the U.S. public.

I have had a passion all of my life in the areas of wellness, self-improvement and the mind-body-spirit connection. I have experience in areas of Community Health, Oncology, Case Management, General Med-Surgical, Orthopedic, and Emergency Nursing. This experience as a Nurse has given me understanding of how all people - patients, their caregivers and the health care workers are affected by stress and burnout. Yoga became my LIFELINE when I was working night shift in the ER - It helped me so much to destress and ultimately take action towards regaining balance in my life. I do have a special interest in helping all Caregivers and Nurses with stress management &amp; self-care.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>My Yoga style is <b>gentle - moderate<\/b> Hatha Yoga designed for stress relief.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My classes are laid back and relaxed...stretch, laugh, build strength and flexibilty and repeat. &nbsp; I am not interested in Yoga as a workout so much as a work IN. &nbsp; &nbsp;My teaching style is focused less on alignment and more on the experience of yoga in your own body. &nbsp; Finding what works for you...<\/p>\n<p>Life is always a balancing act - Yoga is your net!

And for those of us who want to enjoy life! Have more fun! Suffer less!\n\nThe idea is to volunteer, give, get, or trade support. For example, I have a section of my basement that I want to clean up and get rid of stuff I don't need. And I never do it. I'd contact someone in the network (or someone would contact me, if they feel so moved) and we will agree to meet in my basement at a specific time, for one to three hours, and do what needs to be done. I may agree to barter with my support person the same amount of time, where I help him or her another day; or I may just receive the support as a gift, if my person isn't trading or doesn't need support in anything at this time, or prefers that someone else does it; or maybe just believes \"what goes around comes around.\" Whatever.\n\nYou may want a different kind of support, such as to change careers or some action that takes a more sustained effort than simply cleaning up a basement. You'd find someone, or several someones, for that.\n\nYou may wish to volunteer and helps others, even though you don't need support.\n\nYou may be in a tough situation or very challenging time in life, and really need support; so you just receive help, without any compulsion to give back at this time.\n\nI also wish to have more fun and more company in life! \"Many hands make light work\" is an old saying I find quite true.

Our meetups will be in the form of Laughter Yoga and Meditation sessions followed by brief discussions about laughter and play in our lives. \u00a0Laughter Yoga and Meditation involves simple movements, breathing, and obviously laughter, and is open to all ages. \u00a0Comfortable clothing is a plus but Laughter Yoga and Meditation isn't your usually yoga class so no special attire, mats, or props required although you'd be quite surprised on how much a workout continuous laughter can be. \u00a0No previous experience in yoga, meditation, or having a sense of humor necessary. \u00a0Please let me know if you have any questions.<\/p>\n<p>Kevin and I\u00a0started this group because we like to play and laugh, and laughter yoga was one of\u00a0the best ways we have found to fulfill that basic need. There are many proven physical\u00a0and psychological health benefits to the practice, which have been backed by peer-reviewed studies, but speaking to people about laughter yoga what comes up often\u00a0is that people feel they\u2019re not having enough fun in their life. We would like to\u00a0address that.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Which brings up the question: What is laughter yoga? Despite the name, there are\u00a0<br>\n\nno physical poses. What it takes from yoga is the attitude of practice \u2013 the idea isn\u2019t\u00a0<br>\n\nto be the best at doing the exercises, but simply to start where you are and begin\u00a0<br>\n\nto develop, over time, an innate and core aspect of your humanity. While yoga\u00a0<br>\n\nconcentrates mainly on the body, this practice focuses primarily on the capacity for\u00a0<br>\n\nlaughter and playfulness.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Laughter is by its nature contagious, so while it may begin like \"fake\" laughter, it\u00a0<br>\n\noften turns into real authentic laughter. \u00a0Playful exercises are generally the types of games you would play with a young\u00a0child.<\/p>\n<p>Time Magazine, The Huffington Post, and The New Yorker (subscription needed for\u00a0<br>\n\nfull article) have all written about laughter yoga. Though he has no affiliation with\u00a0<br>\n\nlaughter yoga, Dr. Stuart Brown gave an interesting TED talk on the importance\u00a0<br>\n\nof play to the human brain.

(Joomla and WordPress are also CMSs.) Drupal is used to create and manage all kinds of web content. Though Drupal is very powerful as a framework to build websites of all kinds, it is nevertheless remarkably user-friendly. Drupal empowers people from all walks of life, with little previous web design or development skills to relatively easily create dynamic websites with all sorts of bells and whistles. Of course easier doesn\u2019t mean effortless! A growing number of educational, Fortune 500, governments, and nonprofits already use it or are now migrating to Drupal. Places like the MIT Media Lab, The White House, The United Nations, Amnesty International, Best Buy, Zappos, FedEx, and The Economist use Drupal.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>About Best Bilingual Solutions, Inc. : Best Bilingual is a startup publishing house based in Cambridge, Massachusetts that publishes printed, digital and audio books in all the major and many of the minor languages of the world. The company has so far published four titles in up to eight different languages, including English, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Portuguese, Arabic, and French, with many more titles and languages to come in the near future, in printed, audio, and eBook formats.

I knew there had to be other women like me out there looking for connection and support and that's why I started this group. To create a space where we can find other single moms with young children who \"get\" us, share tips and parenting wisdom that will help us find rest, hope and encouragement, and hopefully find new friendships for ourselves and our children along the way. And above all simply have some fun! We can do a mix of girls nights, play dates and fun outings, open to any ideas you ladies have for the group! **By the way we won't be strict with the age cap at 40, my intention was to simply target women with younger children around the same age for play dates ease so feel free to join if you're over 40 too, you don't need to share your age ;)<\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/b\/a\/highres_368925242.jpeg","photo_id":368925242,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/b\/a\/600_368925242.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/b\/a\/thumb_368925242.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11310777,"name":"Felicia Newhouse"},"members":162,"name":"Single Moms of Young Children","id":14726602,"state":"MA","urlname":"singleMoms-Under-40","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Duxbury","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1401293576000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"craftswap","name":"Crafts","id":10099},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"stress-relief","name":"Stress Relief","id":17075},{"urlkey":"color","name":"Color","id":17349},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229},{"urlkey":"coloring","name":"Coloring","id":205031},{"urlkey":"adult-colouring-books-and-pages","name":"Adult colouring books and pages","id":1505792}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Duxbury-Free-Library-Coloring\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Come try the newest craze: coloring for adults!

New members joined after the original members completed the training program, so we've evolved into a more free-form workout-buddy thing where new runners are welcome to start the interval training, old runners are able to do 5K time improver exercises or longer runs according to their own preferences, and everything stays social by scheduling workouts by time instead of by distance so that we all warm up and cool down together. The track is open to the public and I've seen people running, walking, and interval training regardless of what time I've been there, so it's been perfect. There's parking on the street for Somerville residents and a small commuter lot that the campus police seem to ignore. However - we're in a state of transition since we're getting into winter. Because it's been too cold out for regular runs, we've switched over to doing runs every week or two for social reasons\/to get somewhere cool, like the recent runs to Bantam Cider and Downeast Cider. We've talked about Aeronaut Brewery in Cambridge and a few restaurants and festivals. Those runs are around 2 miles and that's the perfect distance to get there in about the same amount of time whether you're running intervals or just doing a straight jog, or faster if you're already really great at it. There's a virtual event posted for a fictional date in March - it's a place to suggest runs, which will then then turn into events.

The purpose of the group is to let members know about upcoming meetings, lectures, study groups and workshops on spirituality, meditation and personal development. Anthroposophy a.k.a. \u201cSpiritual Science\u201d encompasses many forms of spiritual striving, and our goal is to provide an open and supportive environment for discussing topics about inner spiritual development, personal growth and social transformation. As a modern way of knowing, Anthroposophy is non-denominational, and open to all who are on (or seeking) a spiritual path, and wish to share the fruits of their efforts with others. Although general in nature, it should be noted that our activities and the topics of our discussions are often based on or around the work of philosopher and spiritual scientist, Rudolf Steiner. That said, we strive to be open to all paths, and all points of view. The purpose of our group is learning and discussion, based on a firm conviction that we all have something to learn from one another!<\/p>\n<p>For more information about the Boston Anthroposophical Society including ongoing study groups, please check out our website:&nbsp;http:\/\/www.anthroposophyboston.org<\/p>","lon":-71.0999984741,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/4\/0\/c\/highres_408865612.jpeg","photo_id":408865612,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/4\/0\/c\/600_408865612.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/4\/0\/c\/thumb_408865612.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":8984390,"name":"Diane M"},"members":85,"name":"Boston Anthroposophy Meetup","id":16149182,"state":"MA","urlname":"BostonAnthros","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1407161024000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"ixd","name":"Interaction Design","id":10110},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"user-experience","name":"User Experience","id":19243},{"urlkey":"quantified-self","name":"Quantified Self","id":24099},{"urlkey":"user-research","name":"User Research","id":49541},{"urlkey":"ux-design","name":"UX Design","id":61781},{"urlkey":"behavioral-science","name":"Behavioral Science","id":68170},{"urlkey":"behavioral-psychology","name":"Behavioral Psychology","id":97313},{"urlkey":"user-interface-design","name":"User Interface Design","id":104717},{"urlkey":"habits","name":"Habits","id":105877},{"urlkey":"ui-design","name":"UI Design","id":107583},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"behavioral-economics","name":"Behavioral Economics","id":115420},{"urlkey":"behavior-change","name":"Behavior-Change","id":212821}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Action-Design-Boston\/","rating":4.6,"description":"<p>Action Design Boston is a group of designers, developers, entrepreneurs, economists and others who are passionate about helping people create positive change in their lives.

I started this group because my family and I moved to Waltham from Florida September 2013 with our 4 old son and 18 month old daughter and I want to socialize with other mommies and for my kids to have playmates . I had a similar group when we lived in Florida with my girlfriends and it was amazing!! Parents if you have a special needs child(ren), please don't be shy about joining. &nbsp;Please note that mamabakers meet ups are every other week, mostly AM groups and PM at the members request. &nbsp;This is a judgement free, inviting and fun group so if this sounds like the group for you, please feel free to join! &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>As of March 1st there is a strick \"Mamabakers\" policy. Due to the group being held at my private residence, I'm forced to limit the membership to 20-25 members and so far I've kept it at 20-21 members but have been receiving numerous request for membership but is forced to decline their request. I'm overwhelmed with messages in regards to joining the group so I've spoken to the active members and we've implemented a solution. Every member must attend a meetup session once every 2 months to see if the group is the right fit for them, if you don't comply you'll be sent a reminder and if it's ignored you'll become inactive. Starting in the spring I may host meetups on Saturdays or Sundays to accommodate every member. If you have any questions or suggestions please feel free to message me. My intention isn't to offend anyone and I hope you truly understand. &nbsp;In order for a member request to be approved, a picture of yourself or family member must be present thanks!!<\/span><\/p>","lon":-71.2200012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/c\/f\/3\/highres_437107411.jpeg","photo_id":437107411,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/c\/f\/3\/600_437107411.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/c\/f\/3\/thumb_437107411.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":121166402,"name":"Shion Walsh"},"members":26,"name":"Waltham\/Belmont\/Watertown Moms\/dads Who Love to Cook & Bake","id":16917372,"state":"MA","urlname":"Waltham-Moms-Who-Love-to-Cook-and-Bake-Meetup","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":42.4000015259,"who":"Mamabakers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410440788000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"girlfriends","name":"Girlfriends","id":15144},{"urlkey":"girls-having-fun","name":"Girls having fun","id":15413},{"urlkey":"drinking","name":"Drinking","id":15546},{"urlkey":"girls-night-out","name":"Girls' Night Out","id":16550},{"urlkey":"ladies-women","name":"Ladies, Women","id":16881},{"urlkey":"ladies","name":"Ladies","id":18333},{"urlkey":"ladies-fun-chics","name":"Ladies \/ Fun Chics!","id":25538},{"urlkey":"for-people-who-enjoy-going-out","name":"For People Who Enjoy Going Out","id":62358},{"urlkey":"new-girlfriends","name":"New Girlfriends","id":114221},{"urlkey":"social-drinking","name":"social drinking","id":162722},{"urlkey":"make-some-new-girlfriends","name":"Make some new girlfriends","id":385691},{"urlkey":"going-out-dancing-and-drinking","name":"Going out Dancing and Drinking","id":410722},{"urlkey":"ladies-nights-out","name":"Ladies Nights Out","id":1343012}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cambridge-side-30ish-Ladies\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Calling all ladies mid 20's to mid 30's.

Happy Couples is a Meet Up group for couples who respect each other and place a high value on creating stable, loving relationships.<\/p>\n<p>Relationship negativity can be contagious, and is especially uncomfortable to be around if you are consciously working to create harmony in your life. And lets face it, hanging around couples who constantly nag and criticize each other is just a huge drag!! If you are a couple that are in a loving, respectful relationship (or are at least actively trying to achieve that) come hang out with us!<\/p>\n<p>Happy Couples is primarily intended to be a social group. We will get together approximately once per month to do activities like bowling, hiking, dinner\/drinks, etc., and to have fun getting to know other happy, positive couples!<\/p>\n<p>Our secondary hope is that, as people get to know each other, group members can act as positive role models for each other and provide support for handling any relationship challenges that members face. However, sharing of this kind is strictly optional and can be done as selectively and privately as you wish.<\/p>\n<p>It should go without saying that self-righteousness, nagging, criticism, and put downs between partners (or towards other couples) is not welcome at these meet-ups, nor is the use of negative gender stereotypes. However, we do welcome couples of all ages, races, religions, cultural and socio-economic backgrounds, and sexual orientations.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Join us for some couples fun free of unnecessary negativity!!<\/p>","lon":-71.0299987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/1\/a\/highres_408766362.jpeg","photo_id":408766362,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/1\/a\/600_408766362.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/1\/a\/thumb_408766362.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":144182502,"name":"Daniel"},"members":67,"name":"Greater Boston Happy Couples","id":16956692,"state":"MA","urlname":"Greater-Boston-Happy-Couples","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Happy Partners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Swampscott","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410541166000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"single-moms","name":"Single Moms","id":16264},{"urlkey":"single-dads","name":"Single Dads","id":18711},{"urlkey":"infertility-support","name":"Infertility","id":25694},{"urlkey":"new-parents","name":"New Parents","id":30112},{"urlkey":"single-parties","name":"Single Parents","id":59433},{"urlkey":"single-mothers-by-choice","name":"Single mothers by choice","id":92839},{"urlkey":"sperm-donors","name":"Sperm Donors","id":136601},{"urlkey":"mothers-using-ivf-and-or-donors","name":"Mothers using IVF and\/or donors","id":156432},{"urlkey":"egg-donor-moms","name":"Egg Donor Moms","id":168498},{"urlkey":"egg-donor","name":"Egg Donor","id":190041},{"urlkey":"parents-via-egg-donation","name":"Parents Via Egg Donation","id":608972},{"urlkey":"moms-via-egg-donation","name":"Moms via egg donation","id":608992},{"urlkey":"donor-egg-ivf","name":"Donor Egg IVF","id":707472}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Parents-of-Donor-Conceived-Children\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is group is for parents and expectant parents of egg and\/or sperm donor conceived children (both single and coupled parents, with donor children of any age).

I now use a combination of digital and tradition scrapping style. I attend scrapbooking retreats a few times a year which gives me the devoted time I need to focus on my albums.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>My introduction to stamping began with taking a class at a local paper specialty store, that has now since closed (Ink About It). I fell in love with stamping! I love making hand-made cards and the first person I gave one of my cards to was my wonderful Mother-in-law! She was so appreciative that it really made my day. From there I took many classes and read many blogs to learn all about the different products and techniques that are out there! There are so many!!!<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>So..... that takes to me today! When I first started stamping, A Muse Artstamps were the first stamps that captured my attention. A Muse had grown over the years and is now know as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amusestudio.com\/attemptedcreativity\">A Muse Studio<\/a>, a direct sales company which has an incredible product line of stamps, inks, paper, pocket page style scrapbooking albums and supplies, fabulous embellishments, ribbons, tools and so much more! For anyone not familiar with A Muse Studio, they offer an exclusive line of cling-mount red rubber stamps, custom-printed papers, ribbons, dies and embellishments for creating handmade greeting cards, scrapbook pages and more.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>To continue with my love affair with card making, scrapbooking and stamping I joined A Muse Studio three years ago as an Independent Consultant.

I am looking for people with good emotional control and who believe in compromising\/getting along with others. People who truly believe that they are on this earth to work hard, play hard, and feel that they work to live, not live to work and have little desire for materialistic possessions, status quo, or fitting into society. Veterans are very welcome because I am a proud veteran. Those who consider themselves kids at heart are perfect for this group. People of all races, genders and ethnic backgrounds are welcome. I have lived all over the United States and have experience interacting with people of all walks of life and I can get along with anybody. I am looking for a general age range of 25-40 but those older or younger are welcome if they have a positive attitude. Rude or angry behavior and any type of racial, ethnic or gender discrimination will not be tolerated. I am looking for people with a very positive attitude, emotional maturity and a high level of character. It is very important that everybody is willing to interact with one another so that strong friendships can be developed and we can be a tight knit group. I myself am a very nerdy\/geeky good 'ol boy and am not afraid to show others how quirky, silly and funny I am. You will not be judged by myself or others for being yourself as long as you are happy and emotionally stable. A little more about myself: I am a non-conformist. At present, I am content with my life situation. I am 33, a very real person and don't strive to be something that I am not. I'm a grown up kid and believe that the key to true happiness lies in simplicity of life with no materialism, little stress, strong emotional control, a healthy lifestyle and a logical state of mind. I prefer to stay away from Boston. I am very passionate about video games and movies (I love to quote movies) and anything that involves adventure and excitement but not danger or unnecessary risk. I grew up in a rural part of Ohio and am having trouble fitting into the culture in the Boston area. I came here for work. If you are out there and believe that you have a similar state of mind that I do, inquire about joining my group.","lon":-71.1999969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/d\/0\/a\/highres_417079722.jpeg","photo_id":417079722,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/d\/0\/a\/600_417079722.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/d\/0\/a\/thumb_417079722.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":6146091,"name":"Marty "},"members":114,"name":"South Shore Geek Club\/North Shore Geek Club","id":17265362,"state":"MA","urlname":"South-Shore-Geek-Club-North-Shore-Geek-Club","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":42.1899986267,"who":"nerds, geeks, gamers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Natick","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1411940684000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"movies","name":"Watching Movies","id":1201},{"urlkey":"docfilm","name":"Documentary Films","id":4098},{"urlkey":"grassrootsprog","name":"Grassroots Progressives","id":10190},{"urlkey":"movement","name":"Social Movements","id":10460},{"urlkey":"movie-nights","name":"Movie Nights","id":15940},{"urlkey":"social-justice","name":"Social Justice","id":17986},{"urlkey":"activism","name":"Activism","id":19197},{"urlkey":"political-activism","name":"Political Activism","id":19690},{"urlkey":"social-issues","name":"Social Issues","id":31364}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Occupy-Natick-Film-and-Discussion-Meetup-Group\/","rating":3,"description":"This group hosts a monthly free film and discussion series the third Monday of the month, Sept.-June.

It's \"summer\" all year long now for us! We can do what we want, when we want! No more waiting for weekends and then having to try to find parking in crowded lots etc. We are free! I retired from teaching this year and am looking for others who would love to get together for some fun (outdoors preferably) whenever we feel like it! Especially during the week when others are working and places are not crowded. While we will set-up activities to look forward to, those who are up for \"last minute\" gatherings can share their preferred \"instant contact\" info and we can text, email or call one another to invite for spontaneous fun.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>I love to hike (easy to moderate), bike (same), kayak, scuba when in warm waters and explore new places. I also love to travel and think it would be great to have some friends to travel with. (Right now I'm looking at ways to explore New Zealand and Australia and environs, but I am open to anything.) I'll even learn to play cards again when the nights are long and the weather not so inviting. Don't let my \"lack of focus\" scare you- it's just about being OPEN to whatever sounds like fun as the moments arise and acting on it- with friends. I'm so happy to be retired!

If you are in a situation where you have kids and are single, or raising kids \u00a0pretty much on your own, you may be familiar with the unique challenges and difficulties sometimes encountered. The hope is that this group will form a fun, helping, sharing, collaborative group of solos, (be it never married, divorced, widowed, or disconnected from the other parent for wk, military, etc)into a community within a community of people that would like to have a social life for both them and their children. \u00a0We can plan events, meetups and play dates with or without our kids. These meetups can be a huge spectrum of ideas...from parents meeting at a local place to us planning a big moms or dads night out in the city. There are all sorts of possibilities depending on our members. My hope is simply new friends will be made for social contact that is family friendly, or just for the mums and dads that want to connect and have fun with others in common situations. \u00a0&lt;br&gt; Anyone is welcome! It is not a prerequisite to be single, nor is it necessary to even have kids, if you're interested in just the adult time!?<br>\n\nIn the future we may get to a level where we could assist each other with a huge number of things. \u00a0Ie. babysitting, car pooling..there are endless possibilities based on interests of the group! Some trips, activities, excursions, etc, are hard with little ones if you're solo-but with extra hands maybe it's more doable!? Sometimes more enjoyable for parent and kid alike. .....but, as they say, it takes a \" village\" so initial kiddo ideas are endless and based on the ages of the members kids..<\/p>\n<p>So please join us, get Yourself a sitter, bring photo or two of the kiddos ( if you've got kids) and let's see where it goes....If\u00a0you're looking to join and you don't have kids, you can get a feel for the crowd. Many people that are looking for fun stuff to do around the south shore may have kids, but they're off to college, etc, and can enjoy the adult time with other singles..... And you can enjoy kiddo activities and play dates on weeks with kids, as we plan them.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I envision a supportive laid back group of solos that enjoy staying active, getting out here and there, being social and want to further their kids socially...As parents with our kids, plus an extra set of eyes n hands.
