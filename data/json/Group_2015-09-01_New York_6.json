We do <em><strong>not<\/strong><\/em> support \"starve the beast\" as a political strategy, and feel that should significant tax cuts come, they should be <em><strong>after<\/strong><\/em> we have been running a budget surplus for years, sufficient to pay down the national debt to less than 70% of GDP. Tax increases should not be off the table.<\/p>\n<p>This meetup is about economics and politics, but only politics that relate to economics.<\/p>\n<p>Social and religious issues are off-topic unless they relate to economics.<\/p>\n<p>Investment strategies may be discussed, but they are not the central theme of this meetup.<\/p>\n<p>While the soul of this meetup is Libertarian, this is not a Libertarian Party meetup, partly because the US constitution usually dooms 3rd parties to obscurity, and partly because we want to be more pragmatic and less ideologically pure than the Libertarian Party.<\/p>\n<p>Topics we would like to discuss:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why did the mortgage meltdown happen -- was it \"excessive deregulation\", or was it \"just a bubble bursting\"? If it was a bubble bursting, can regulation prevent bubbles?<\/li>\n<li>Is it reasonable to expect people in government to be so much smarter than the market that they can accurately perceive bubbles and take corrective measures before the market has figured out that a bubble is happening?<\/li>\n<li>Ben Bernanke says that the bond market currently overestimates the government's willingness to bail out a big bank in the future, and he says the government now has tools to wind down a large organization that didn't exist in 2008. Should we believe him?<\/li>\n<li>Some types of regulation are clearly bad. What types of regulation are good?<\/li>\n<li>Do we need banks that are big enough to pose systemic risk? Or should we impose a \"systemic risk tax\" to penalize banks for being too big, so that they will voluntarily split themselves into smaller organizations?<\/li>\n<li>Is growing inequality a problem if poverty is not increasing and median income is not declining?<\/li>\n<li>Which is the worse sin: greed or envy?<\/li>\n<li>Incumbents usually want stimulus, while the opposition usually screams bloody murder about the deficit. Should we opt for more stimulus now, or austerity, or are we currently making the right trade off?<\/li>\n<li>You may love or hate Obamacare, but everyone agrees it won't do anything to contain our country's rampant medical inflation. What should be done to address this problem?<\/li>\n<li>Economic Liberals, like those who run the Tenement Museum on the LES, often point to conditions in the 19th century and claim \"that is where unbridled capitalism would take us\". How did people's living conditions in the 19th century compare to their living standards before that? Do we owe our improved standard of living to politicians, union organizers, and regulators, as these people would claim, or to the inventors and industrialists who made dramatic increases in productivity possible?<\/li>\n<li>Dodd-Frank: pros and cons?<\/li>\n<li>The cost of college has been increasing much faster than inflation. The \"US News and World Report\"'s annual ranking of colleges actually <em><strong>rewards<\/strong><\/em> schools for spending more money per pupil. Many students are graduating so far in debt they are unlikely be debt-free before they are 30. This whole problem undermines social mobility. Why is this happening and what can be done about it?<\/li>\n<li>China's gradual adoption of market reforms after the death of Mao and the discrediting of the Soviet economic model around 1990 have made market economics the only game in town. This has brought a flood of good news from economies that 20 years ago were deemed hopeless. Living standards in China and India have increased dramatically, and there are 3 cellphones for every four Africans.<\/li>\n<\/ul>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/2\/a\/highres_214336682.jpeg","photo_id":214336682,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/2\/a\/600_214336682.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/2\/a\/thumb_214336682.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":2341848,"name":"Bill"},"members":131,"name":"Fans of Capitalism","id":7645202,"state":"NY","urlname":"Fans-of-Capitalism","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1363466408000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"dotnet","name":".NET","id":827},{"urlkey":"consultant","name":"Consulting","id":915},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"ip-telephony","name":"IP Telephony","id":46498},{"urlkey":"unified-communications","name":"Unified Communications","id":65684},{"urlkey":"microsft","name":"Microsoft","id":88327},{"urlkey":"microsoft-technology","name":"Microsoft Technology","id":99537},{"urlkey":"microsoft-exchange-server","name":"Microsoft Exchange Server","id":113483},{"urlkey":"unified-messaging","name":"Unified Messaging","id":113486},{"urlkey":"microsoft-lync","name":"Microsoft Lync","id":134367},{"urlkey":"overview-of-office-365-features-and-functionalites","name":"Overview of Office 365 features and functionalites","id":311481},{"urlkey":"office-365-users-group","name":"Office 365 Users Group","id":387711},{"urlkey":"lync","name":"Lync","id":465662},{"urlkey":"office-365","name":"Office 365","id":483322},{"urlkey":"microsoft-office-365-public-cloud-based-technology","name":"Microsoft Office 365 public cloud-based technology","id":543292}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NJ-Unified-Communication-User-Group\/","rating":4.74,"description":"<p><span style=\"color : #000080 ; font-size : medium\"><strong>All Our events are hosted via MS LYNC now.

Our first accomplishment \u2013 though rather small, was giving a meager sum to the roundstarfoundation.org as two coaches went and set up clinics to coach kids and also teachers who want to lead community teams in<\/span> <span>Zimbabwe<\/span><span>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We are building our charity work as Beautiful Game grows. So we ask for $2 donations per game to cover our costs.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Meetup is a great website that connects all of us soccer lovers but in case you did not know. It is not free. Meetup charges $45 every 3 months to use it. Simple math= 3 months, goes into 12 months, 4 times. That\u2019s $180 per year to use Meetup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We also provide top quality gear. We play with 6 foot Pugg nets, cones, a kick-ass (pun intended) FIFA authentic Bola Official ball of Brasil ($150) and not so world class bibs. We hope to get nicer bibs in the future.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n We want to keep our current schedule of Mon-Wed-Fri<\/span> <span>1pm<\/span> <span>kickoffs but I'm not able to make it every time as I have coaching scheduling conflicts some days. So Mpande is running the Meetups on the days I can't. And he will set up the pitch so you can all play, but also, he will be collecting. Please don\u2019t make him beg for a dollar. He truly does this for the love of the game, but lugging 6 foot goals on the subway is no fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If your attitude is like \u2018F*ck this shit no way I\u2019m paying for pickup soccer in NYC!\u2019 that\u2019s cool there are many other soccer Meetup groups.

It\u2019s all about helping those that could use it.

Come to these meetups to learn how you can help yourself and others by knocking out the anxiety that underpins habits that damage our minds and bodies. You will learn to tap acupuncture points on your face, hands and body to instantly collapse panic attacks, overwhelming negative feelings, and self-sabotaging beliefs. You don't need to talk about that abusive event you survived. You don't need to re-live a disaster. Tapping works on the sub-verbal level, which is why it also works on people who cannot communicate (maybe because of a language barrier -- or maybe they're in a coma). Tapping works on infants and animals too. Sounds too good to be true? Join this group. Skeptics are my favorite people to work with because they keep me honest and are my strongest supporters when they experience this form of healing for themselves.<\/p>","lon":-73.9499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/0\/7\/6\/highres_335176502.jpeg","photo_id":335176502,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/0\/7\/6\/600_335176502.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/0\/7\/6\/thumb_335176502.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":83186772,"name":"Janelle"},"members":227,"name":"Tapping for Happiness, Inner Peace and Courageous Living","id":8105012,"state":"NY","urlname":"Tapping-for-Happiness-Inner-Peace-and-Courageous-Living","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Life Changers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Staten Island","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1366221947000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"webdesign","name":"Web Design","id":659},{"urlkey":"freelance","name":"Freelance","id":9876},{"urlkey":"coworking","name":"Coworking","id":14990},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"creative-freelancers","name":"Creative Freelancers","id":25505},{"urlkey":"collaboration-between-creative-minds","name":"Collaboration between Creative Minds","id":29526},{"urlkey":"lean-startup","name":"Lean Startup","id":38660},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595},{"urlkey":"start-ups","name":"start-ups","id":130937},{"urlkey":"business-strategy-and-coworking","name":"Business Strategy and Coworking","id":161350},{"urlkey":"co-working-space","name":"Co-working Space","id":328491},{"urlkey":"building-a-coworking-community","name":"Building a Coworking Community","id":660992}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Startup-Staten-Island-Tech-Meetup\/","rating":4.85,"description":"<p>Tech, startups, coworking, maker spaces and a whole new entrepreneurial culture has grown and evolved throughout New York City.

When a community of shared values and goals come together there is an innate inspiration that happens when all energies are focused and directed together towards a common good. Many of us live below our potential and have so many dreams that we want to create...yet we sabatoge ourselves with our negative self talk. The intention of this meet up is to create a safe environment for all women who want to move forward in their lives and live their greatness as well as enjoy taking journeys of travel and adventure . &nbsp;We will be exploring many varied topics including learning how to use tools for self empowerment and self improvement...make empowering choices to create the life you want to live...start responding to life rather directing it ....creating a positive mindset and using the law of attraction to manifest your dreams and goals. This is a new facet of TRAVELING and growing ..sharing and learning. &nbsp;It is a shared empowerment group to facilitate moving forward.<\/p>","lon":-74.4100036621,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/3\/e\/highres_231177662.jpeg","photo_id":231177662,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/3\/e\/600_231177662.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/3\/e\/thumb_231177662.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8481475,"name":"M"},"members":79,"name":"LES SPIRIT ADVENTURES","id":8278302,"state":"NJ","urlname":"LES-SPIRIT-ADVENTURES","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.4300003052,"who":"Spirit AdVenture WOMEN"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1367282306000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"sysadmin","name":"System Administration","id":2109},{"urlkey":"projectmgmt","name":"Project Management","id":3438},{"urlkey":"information-technology","name":"Information Technology","id":15568},{"urlkey":"it-infrastructure","name":"IT Infrastructure","id":20480},{"urlkey":"technology-professionals","name":"Technology Professionals","id":22203},{"urlkey":"information-technology-in-business","name":"Information Technology in Business","id":22239},{"urlkey":"information-security","name":"Information Security","id":32743},{"urlkey":"itil-itsm","name":"ITIL ITSM","id":46813},{"urlkey":"it","name":"IT","id":56729},{"urlkey":"help-desk","name":"Help Desk","id":66896},{"urlkey":"it-professionals","name":"IT Professionals","id":164111}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-HDI-Chapter\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Guided by an international panel of industry experts and practitioners, HDI serves a community of more than 120,000 technical service and support professionals and is the premier resource for best practices and emerging trends.<\/p>","lon":-74.0100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":91411372,"name":"Kevin Staley"},"members":13,"name":"NYC HDI Chapter","id":8280572,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-HDI-Chapter","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"HDI Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Fairfield","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1367290479000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"photoshop","name":"Photoshop","id":186},{"urlkey":"digcam","name":"Digital Photography","id":206},{"urlkey":"photo","name":"Photography","id":223},{"urlkey":"photography-classes","name":"Photography Classes","id":15043},{"urlkey":"boudoir-photography","name":"Boudoir Photography","id":15574},{"urlkey":"group-photo-shoots","name":"Group Photo Shoots","id":15731},{"urlkey":"portrait-photography","name":"Portrait Photography","id":16613},{"urlkey":"location-photography","name":"Location Photography","id":16614},{"urlkey":"model-photography","name":"Model Photography","id":16615},{"urlkey":"fashion-photography","name":"Fashion Photography","id":17885},{"urlkey":"pin-up-photography","name":"Pin Up Photography","id":19645},{"urlkey":"studio-photography","name":"Studio Photography","id":19646},{"urlkey":"nude-photography","name":"Nude Photography","id":40287},{"urlkey":"photographer-and-model-workshops","name":"Photographer and Model Workshops","id":44168},{"urlkey":"glamour-photography","name":"Glamour Photography","id":48375},{"urlkey":"adobe-lightroom","name":"Adobe Lightroom","id":704882}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/","rating":4.91,"description":"<p>This group is for the photographer that wants to to shoot in interesting locations, diverse themes, fun models and build a diverse portfolio while learning many different techniques and having fun in the process.

George Washington, to his troops before the battle of Long Island<\/p>\n<p>Such a time is near at hand again. The fate of unborn millions will now depend, under God, on the Courage and Conduct of this Army \u2013 and this Marine Corps, This Air Force, This Navy and the National Guard and police units of these sovereign states. Oath Keepers is a non-partisan association of currently serving military, reserves, National Guard, peace officers, fire-fighters, and veterans who swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic \u2026 and meant it.<\/p>\n<p>We won\u2019t \u201cjust follow orders.\u201d Below is our declaration of orders we will NOT obey because we will consider them unconstitutional (and thus unlawful) and immoral violations of the natural rights of the people. Such orders would be acts of war against the American people by their own government, and thus acts of treason. We will not make war against our own people. We will not commit treason. We will defend the Republic.<\/p>\n<p>Declaration of Orders&nbsp;<span>We Will NOT Obey<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Recognizing that we each swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and affirming that we are guardians of the Republic, of the principles in our Declaration of Independence, and of the rights of our people, we affirm and declare the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>1. We will NOT obey any order to disarm the American people.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The attempt to disarm the people on April 19, 1775 was the spark of open conflict in the American Revolution. That vile attempt was an act of war, and the American people fought back in justified, righteous self-defense of their natural rights. Any such order today would also be an act of war against the American people, and thus an act of treason. We will not make war on our own people, and we will not commit treason by obeying any such treasonous order. Nor will we assist, or support any such attempt to disarm the people by other government entities, either state or federal. In addition, we affirm that the purpose of the Second Amendment is to preserve the military power of the people so that they will, in the last resort, have effective final recourse to arms and to the God of Hosts in the face of tyranny. Accordingly, we oppose any and all further infringements on the right of the people to keep and bear arms. In particular we oppose a renewal of the misnamed \u201cassault-weapons\u201d ban or the enactment of H.R. 45 (which would register and track gun owners like convicted pedophiles).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>2. We will NOT obey any order to conduct warrantless searches of the American people, their homes, vehicles, papers, or effects \u2013 such as warrantless house-to house searches for weapons or persons.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>One of the causes of the American Revolution was the use of \u201cwrits of assistance,\u201d which were essentially warrantless searches because there was no requirement of a showing of probable cause to a judge, and the first fiery embers of American resistance were born in opposition to those infamous writs. The Founders considered all warrantless searches to be unreasonable and egregious. It was to prevent a repeat of such violations of the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects that the Fourth Amendment was written. We expect that sweeping warrantless searches of homes and vehicles, under some pretext, will be the means used to attempt to disarm the people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>3. We will NOT obey any order to detain American citizens as \u201cunlawful enemy combatants\u201d or to subject them to trial by military tribunal.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>One of the causes of the American Revolution was the denial of the right to jury trial, the use of admiralty courts (military tribunals) instead, and the application of the laws of war to the colonists. After that experience, and being well aware of the infamous Star Chamber in English history, the Founders ensured that the international laws of war would apply only to foreign enemies, not to the American people. Thus, the Article III Treason Clause establishes the only constitutional form of trial for an American, not serving in the military, who is accused of making war on his own nation. Such a trial for treason must be before a civilian jury, not a tribunal. The international laws of war do not trump our Bill of Rights. We reject as illegitimate any such claimed power, as did the Supreme Court in Ex Parte Milligan (1865). Any attempt to apply the laws of war to American civilians, under any pretext, such as against domestic \u201cmilitia\u201d groups the government brands \u201cdomestic terrorists,\u201d is an act of war and an act of treason.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>4. We will NOT obey orders to impose martial law or a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d on a state, or to enter with force into a state, without the express consent and invitation of that state\u2019s legislature and governor.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>One of the causes of the American Revolution was the attempt \u201cto render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power\u201d by disbanding the Massachusetts legislature and appointing General Gage as \u201cmilitary governor.\u201d The attempt to disarm the people of Massachusetts during that martial law sparked our Revolution. Accordingly, the power to impose martial law \u2013 the absolute rule over the people by a military officer with his will alone being law \u2013 is nowhere enumerated in our Constitution. Further, it is the militia of a state and of the several states that the Constitution contemplates being used in any context, during any emergency within a state, not the standing army. The imposition of martial law by the national government over a state and its people, treating them as an occupied enemy nation, is an act of war. Such an attempted suspension of the Constitution and Bill of Rights voids the compact with the states and with the people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>5. We will NOT obey orders to invade and subjugate any state that asserts its sovereignty and declares the national government to be in violation of the compact by which that state entered the Union.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In response to the obscene growth of federal power and to the absurdly totalitarian claimed powers of the Executive, upwards of 20 states are considering, have considered, or have passed courageous resolutions affirming states rights and sovereignty. Those resolutions follow in the honored and revered footsteps of Jefferson and Madison in their Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, and likewise seek to enforce the Constitution by affirming the very same principles of our Declaration, Constitution, and Bill of Rights that we Oath Keepers recognize and affirm. Chief among those principles is that ours is a dual sovereignty system, with the people of each state retaining all powers not granted to the national government they created, and thus the people of each state reserved to themselves the right to judge when the national government they created has voided the compact between the states by asserting powers never granted. Upon the declaration by a state that such a breach has occurred, we will not obey orders to force that state to submit to the national government.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>6. We will NOT obey any order to blockade American cities, thus turning them into giant concentration camps.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>One of the causes of the American Revolution was the blockade of Boston, and the occupying of that city by the British military, under martial law. Once hostilities began, the people of Boston were tricked into turning in their arms in exchange for safe passage, but were then forbidden to leave. That confinement of the residents of an entire city was an act of war. Such tactics were repeated by the Nazis in the Warsaw Ghetto, and by the Imperial Japanese in Nanking, turning entire cities into death camps. Any such order to disarm and confine the people of an American city will be an act of war and thus an act of treason.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>7. We will NOT obey any order to force American citizens into any form of detention camps under any pretext.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Mass, forced internment into concentration camps was a hallmark of every fascist and communist dictatorship in the 20th Century. Such internment was unfortunately even used against American citizens of Japanese descent during World War II. Whenever a government interns its own people, it treats them like an occupied enemy population. Oppressive governments often use the internment of women and children to break the will of the men fighting for their liberty \u2013 as was done to the Boers, to the Jewish resisters in the Warsaw Ghetto, and to the Chechens, for example. Such a vile order to forcibly intern Americans without charges or trial would be an act of war against the American people, and thus an act of treason, regardless of the pretext used. We will not commit treason, nor will we facilitate or support it.\u201dNOT on Our Watch!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>8. We will NOT obey orders to assist or support the use of any foreign troops on U.S. soil against the American people to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d or to \u201cmaintain control\u201d during any emergency, or under any other pretext.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We will consider such use of foreign troops against our people to be an invasion and an act of war. During the American Revolution, the British government enlisted the aid of Hessian mercenaries in an attempt to subjugate the rebellious American people. Throughout history, repressive regimes have enlisted the aid of foreign troops and mercenaries who have no bonds with the people. Accordingly, as the militia of the several states are the only military force contemplated by the Constitution, in Article I, Section 8, for domestic keeping of the peace, and as the use of even our own standing army for such purposes is without such constitutional support, the use of foreign troops and mercenaries against the people is wildly unconstitutional, egregious, and an act of war. We will oppose such troops as enemies of the people and we will treat all who request, invite, and aid those foreign troops as the traitors they are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>9. We will NOT obey any orders to confiscate the property of the American people, including food and other essential supplies, under any emergency pretext whatsoever.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>One of the causes of the American Revolution was the seizure and forfeiture of American ships, goods, and supplies, along with the seizure of American timber for the Royal Navy, all in violation of the people\u2019s natural right to their property and to the fruits of their labor. The final spark of the Revolution was the attempt by the government to seize powder and cannon stores at Concord. Deprivation of food has long been a weapon of war and oppression, with millions intentionally starved to death by fascist and communist governments in the 20th Century alone. Accordingly, we will not obey or facilitate orders to confiscate food and other essential supplies from the people, and we will consider all those who issue or carry out such orders to be the enemies of the people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>10. We will NOT obey any orders which infringe on the right of the people to free speech, to peaceably assemble, and to petition their government for a redress of grievances.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>There would have been no American Revolution without fiery speakers and writers such as James Otis, Patrick Henry, Thomas Paine, and Sam Adams \u201csetting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men.\u201d Patrick Henry: \u201cGive me Liberty, or Give me DEATH!\u201d Tyrants know that the pen of a man such as Thomas Paine can cause them more damage than entire armies, and thus they always seek to suppress the natural rights of speech, association, and assembly. Without freedom of speech, the people will have no recourse but to arms. Without freedom of speech and conscience, there is no freedom. Therefore, we will not obey or support any orders to suppress or violate the right of the people to speak, associate, worship, assemble, communicate, or petition government for the redress of grievances. \u2014 And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually affirm our oath and pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor. Oath Keepers The above list is not exhaustive but we do consider them to be clear tripwires \u2013 they form our \u201cline in the sand,\u201d and if we receive such orders, we will not obey them. Further, we will know that the time for another American Revolution is nigh. If you the people decide that you have no recourse, and such a revolution comes, at that time, not only will we NOT fire upon our fellow Americans who righteously resist such egregious violations of their God given rights, we will join them in fighting against those who dare attempt to enslave them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>NOTE: please also read our Principles of Our Republic We Are Sworn to Defend<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Oath Keepers is a non partisan association of currently serving military, peace officers, fire-fighters, and veterans who will fulfill our oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, so help us God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Our oath is to the Constitution, not to the politicians, and not to any political party. In the long-standing tradition of the U.S. military, we are apolitical. We don\u2019t care if unlawful orders come from a Democrat or a Republican, or if the violation is bi-partisan. We will not obey unconstitutional (and thus unlawful) and immoral orders, such as orders to disarm the American people or to place them under martial law. We won\u2019t \u201cjust follow orders.\u201d Our motto: \u201cNot on Our Watch!\u201d or to put it even more succinctly, in the words of 101st Airborne Commander General Anthony McAuliffe at the Battle of the Bulge, \u201cNUTS!\u201d There is at this time a debate within the ranks of the military regarding their oath. Some mistakenly believe they must follow any order the President issues. But many others do understand that their loyalty is to the Constitution and to the people, and understand what that means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The mission of Oath Keepers is to vastly increase their numbers. We are in a battle for the hearts and minds of our own troops.

Bring your friendly dog to Camp Canine on Sunday afternoons at 2pm and join us for an hour or two of playtime, training advice, and a little socialization. An expert trainer is always on hand to monitor play and to offer advice tailored to the dogs who are there that day. The trainer will explain training games and real life solutions to behavior issues during playtime. Each meet up has a theme relevant to the dogs who attend. For example: Using the \"SIT\" cue to help regulate over-excited players. If you have questions that do not apply to the whole group, the trainer will provide time near the end of the meet up to answer as many as possible. It is imperative for a city dog to have a healthy play relationship with other dogs (he needs friends too!) so that he can remain polite and sociable throughout his life.

THIS GAME IS NOT FOR BEGINNER OR INTERMEDIATE PLAYERS. We sometimes like to go out for beer afterwards. We like players who pass the ball and don't slide tackle. We just like to have fun and meet new people. If this sounds like you, come play!<\/p>\n<p>We use the following rules in our group to make it fair for everyone:<\/p>\n<p>1) Play can be quite fast and aggressive, but friendly. If the ball goes out, call it out even if the other team gets the throw in. Don't argue about every goal. Sometimes you fall down or get kicked, but do not foul. We ask repeat offenders to leave the group.<\/p>\n<p>2) We have no waiting list for games. If a game fills up, you can only jump on a spot if someone cancels. Anyone can come to the game to see if a spot is open, but if it is full, sorry.<\/p>\n<p>3) COME ON TIME. If you are not ready to play at the scheduled start time, you cannot play. If someone is there to play on time, they get your spot. Even if no one else is there to take your spot, you can't play if you come late. We are serious about this.<\/p>\n<p>4) No shows prevent other people from playing, so always cancel as early as possible if you can't make it. WE TAKE THE RSVP LIST ONE HOUR BEFORE THE GAME - AFTER THAT IF YOU CANCEL YOU ARE CONSIDERED A NO SHOW. If you are a no-show multiple times, you will be removed from the Meetup group. This is so that other people can have time to rsvp yes if you cancel.<\/p>\n<p>5) If you play, play the entire scheduled game. It is not fair to people on the waiting list or your teammates if you leave early.

Our zip codes range from the East Village to East Harlem, Soho to Sunset Park, Williamsburg to Woodlawn, Crown Heights to Chelsea, Astoria to Annadale.

The community will give you access to world-class fitness equipment, increase your workout time spent outdoors, and offer the ability to push yourself against your peers. What will the meetups consist of? It is simple, tell us what equipment you\u2019re interested in trying out and we will look to have it available for you at the next meetup. We will facilitate exercise sessions using untraditional outdoor fitness equipment such as elliptical bikes, nordic rollerblades, stand up paddle skateboards and anything else our members are interested in getting involved in without incurring the large up-front costs of ownership (not to mention the hassle of storage). The first meetup will be planned for mid-August and will be followed by drinks at a watering hole near Central Park where we can get to know\u00a0each other. \u00a0 Cant wait to meet everyone while working out with something new outdoors and close to home...<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":100984562,"name":"Patrick"},"members":55,"name":"Central Park Alternative Outdoor Fitness","id":9234002,"state":"NY","urlname":"Central-Park-Alternative-Outdoor-Fitness-and-Equipment-Share","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Advanced Athletes"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1373158417000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"womens-fitness","name":"Women's Fitness","id":15123},{"urlkey":"weight-loss-support","name":"Weight Loss Support","id":15538},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"womens-business-networking","name":"Women's Business Networking","id":21283},{"urlkey":"crossfit","name":"CrossFit","id":21890},{"urlkey":"group-womens-fitness","name":"GROUP WOMENS FITNESS","id":188431}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NY-Womens-FitLife\/","rating":4.12,"description":"<p>Hi my NY fit girls!!!\u00a0 It's 2014 and it's a new year and we are still at\u00a0\u00a0 this thing call fit life and we are still excited.<\/p>\n<p>This group is a resource for encouragement, celebration, and most importantly fitness.\u00a0 We are a power group that desire only, and I mean only to have a healthy, fitness-filled, full, and fabulous lives.\u00a0 We\u00a0all have different fitness paths and all have different starting points but the best of all, we are all here for the same reason...that's to empower other people to be healthy and whole.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you again for joining and I look forward to celebrating your fitness and health successes!!!!<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/1\/2\/6\/highres_258072582.jpeg","photo_id":258072582,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/1\/2\/6\/600_258072582.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/1\/2\/6\/thumb_258072582.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":44792342,"name":"Shelly Caldwell"},"members":91,"name":"NY Women's FitLife","id":9242372,"state":"NY","urlname":"NY-Womens-FitLife","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":40.75,"who":"NY Fit Girls"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1373165388000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"physics","name":"Physics","id":86},{"urlkey":"quantumcomputing","name":"Quantum Computing","id":10397},{"urlkey":"quantum-mechanics","name":"quantum mechanics","id":18550},{"urlkey":"quantum-physics","name":"Quantum Physics","id":18551},{"urlkey":"computer-science","name":"Computer Science","id":21751},{"urlkey":"mathematics","name":"Mathematics","id":33876},{"urlkey":"computing","name":"Computing","id":50927},{"urlkey":"algorithms","name":"Algorithms","id":111155}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Quantum-Computing-NYC\/","rating":4.92,"description":"<p>This is a group for anyone interested in quantum computing.

When you improve your speech, you increase your confidence, and enhance your chances for success, both professionally and socially.<\/p>\n<p>www.accentjweinman.com<\/p>","lon":-73.9400024414,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8521455,"name":"Judy Weinman"},"members":364,"name":"NYC Accent Reduction classes","id":9496682,"state":"NY","urlname":"accentjweinman-com","category":{"name":"language\/ethnic identity","id":16,"shortname":"language"},"lat":40.8499984741,"who":"English improvers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"South River","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1374680516000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"jewishparenting","name":"Jewish Parenting","id":3888},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"workingmoms","name":"Working Moms","id":10555},{"urlkey":"babies","name":"Babies","id":15461},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"new-moms","name":"New Moms","id":16208},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147},{"urlkey":"jewish-families","name":"Jewish families","id":51818},{"urlkey":"jewish-and-interfaith-families","name":"Jewish and Interfaith Families","id":81948},{"urlkey":"single-jewish-parents","name":"Single Jewish Parents","id":162638},{"urlkey":"raising-jewish-children","name":"Raising Jewish Children","id":164989},{"urlkey":"celebrate-jewish-holidays","name":"Celebrate Jewish holidays","id":283791},{"urlkey":"young-jewish-families-expecting-young-couples","name":"Young Jewish Families\/ Expecting Young Couples","id":385911},{"urlkey":"jewish-kids","name":"jewish kids","id":411342},{"urlkey":"jewish-families-with-young-children","name":"Jewish Families with young children","id":1382362}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Families-with-Young-Jewish-Children-in-Middlesex-County\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Check out our monthly programs for families with young Jewish children in Middlesex County.

We will playfully push boundaries with motion, sound and other fun ways to use our creativity in the moment.<\/p>\n<p>Some games and activities you may recognize (tag, everyone's it!), others you probably will not! (clown bumper cars, human accordion). Enjoy tapping into the clown's world of breaking expectations \u2013 and limitations. We will also be doing some energy awareness and breathing exercises - learn some energetic healing techniques that you can do anytime. If you want to be more spontaneous, see the world differently, connect more fully with yourself and others and re-energize your playful self then join us!<\/p>\n<p>Play is a respite from our self-doubts and fears, and opens us up to joy and the freedom that comes from a state of acceptance of our most authentic selves. It is about letting our true selves shine without fear or worry.\u00a0 Whoever or wherever you are right now is perfect.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about the story behind this Meetup, please visit www.LynnLevity.com.<\/p>\n<iframe src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/yj__m-GpEi0\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" style=\"margin : 5px ; max-width : 700px ; max-height : 700px\"><\/iframe> <iframe src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/buTs9sG72J4\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" style=\"margin : 5px ; max-width : 700px ; max-height : 700px\"><\/iframe> <iframe src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/b-7sphdPf2c\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" style=\"margin : 5px ; max-width : 700px ; max-height : 700px\"><\/iframe> <iframe src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MRcL3z9fsPE\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" style=\"margin : 5px ; max-width : 700px ; max-height : 700px\"><\/iframe> <iframe src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/PEYHoxYohoo\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" style=\"margin : 5px ; max-width : 700px ; max-height : 700px\"><\/iframe> <iframe src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/e3N9gXgz0JI\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" style=\"margin : 5px ; max-width : 700px ; max-height : 700px\"><\/iframe>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/a\/6\/2\/highres_293059042.jpeg","photo_id":293059042,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/a\/6\/2\/600_293059042.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/a\/6\/2\/thumb_293059042.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":1299350,"name":"Lynn"},"members":173,"name":"Lighten Up NYC!","id":9621812,"state":"NY","urlname":"Lighten-Up-NYC","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Fun-loving souls"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1375384069000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"wholefood","name":"Whole Food Nutrition","id":5951},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"plant-based-nutrition","name":"Plant-Based Nutrition","id":19490},{"urlkey":"healthy-eating","name":"Healthy Eating","id":19630},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"health-and-nutrition","name":"Health and Nutrition","id":22412},{"urlkey":"prenatal-nutrition-and-self-care","name":"Prenatal Nutrition and Self Care","id":22627},{"urlkey":"nutrition-and-healing","name":"Nutrition and Healing","id":23034},{"urlkey":"cooking-classes","name":"Cooking Classes","id":26041},{"urlkey":"childrens-health-and-nutrition","name":"Children's Health and Nutrition","id":26929},{"urlkey":"living-herbs-for-nutrition","name":"Living Herbs for Nutrition","id":30067},{"urlkey":"cooking-any-and-all-kinds-of-cooking","name":"Cooking","id":43256},{"urlkey":"recipes","name":"Recipes","id":50709}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cooking-classes-for-a-healthy-lifestyle\/","rating":0,"description":"For anyone who is interested in learning more about eating and being healthy.

Food can often be a great unifier, acting as the common ground for people who might otherwise have different interests. And what better way to get to know people than in a personal setting around a freshly cooked meal. In this group, we will have small gatherings in members' homes to share home cooked meals. One host will cook the meal and each guest will pay a small fee to compensate the host. All levels of cooking (and eating) experience are welcome! We hope this will act as a forum to convene friendly dinner parties, meet interesting new people, and eat some great food along the way.

While many of our members have eliminated employment altogether, others still work full time, part-time, flex-time, night shifts, have home-based businesses, consult or freelance from home, or have chosen alternative, less demanding career paths so that they are more available to their families. Our goal is to support the decisions made by our members. We will never pass judgment on mothers who choose to make or are forced to make different decisions for their families. Our purpose is to foster a nurturing environment where we can share the concerns and challenges of raising children, maintaining our families and ourselves, hoping to create a village of support that extends beyond meetings. Many of us have grown weary being the only black Mom at story time, swim class, etc, we seek to build a community of inclusion to help alleviate the isolation and loneness both stay-at-home and working mothers of color may feel navigating through the adventures of motherhood.

The newsletter was intended to encourage these mothers to feel good about their choice as well as to provide information to help them be the best and most important influence in their children\u2019s lives. It was distributed to over 100 moms across the country in the spring of 1997. During the summer of 1997, moms in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland decided to form a support group called Mocha Moms, Inc.

Subjects can be as ephemeral as \"love,\" \"god,\" and \"purpose,\" or as grounded as \"politics,\" \"environmentalism,\" and \"family.\" 2) At the meetup, people are encouraged to propose a question related to the subject. The moderator will collect all of the questions in a list. 3) The group will then vote on the questions. In the first round of voting, each individual may vote for as many questions as they like. The top three will then go to a second round, where each individual may vote just once. 4) The question with the most votes is then discussed. Often, the discussion starts with a narrowing of the question, as it can be challenging to devise a question that can possibly be answered by a small group in just a couple of hours' discussion. If you have a subject you'd like to discuss, feel free to tell the moderator. A list of subjects will be kept and selected from at random each month. One final note: there is no obligation to engage in the discussion. While we encourage everyone to speak if they have something to say, we also welcome those who would rather just observe and learn from others.

From our traderoom in Midtown Manhattan we gather traders with a myriad of methodologies and perspectives to help (1) those now trading enhance their processes and results, and (2) those starting out develop a core trading methodology. In the months ahead we will develop extensions to regular live meet-ups through a free, online trading community to permit members to share ideas, charts, engage in discussions, deal with the ups and downs of this business, overcome inertia in getting off the ground, and other subjects.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For those bouncing from one approach to another, looking at dozens of webinars and being bombarded by miracle systems in emails, getting started is daunting. Besides regular monthly in-person gatherings, we will have a free extension to let people share what they're doing, which can act as a trigger for aspiring traders to identify trade-styles and methods that resonate for them. Trading isn't one-size-fits-all. <\/p>\n<p>Those who are progressing are always looking to continue their advancement. Trading is a journey and an evolution. For those of you comfortable with your progress, you know there's always something new to learn and no part of your process is ever perfect. Sometimes your progress stalls. Talking to the right person or hearing about something someone else is doing that resonates for you can be the catalyst for another leap forward. Maybe it's the force that spurs your advancement and makes you (more) profitable. <br><\/p>\n<p><i><b>\u2022 Come join us!!!<\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>ABOUT THE ORGANIZER <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>I'm Mitch Firestone, a full-time trader here in NYC. I live in Chelsea and work out of a traderoom in Midtown West. I have stepped up to become the new organizer of NYCTTT so want to introduce myself.<\/p>\n<p>I've been trading successfully for a living for 3+ years, supporting myself and my family 100% through trading: (1) day- and swing-trading equities (2) options and (3) intraday futures. Now three years into being fully confident in my individual trading, I started coaching aspiring and intermediate traders about 18 months ago, and in the last six months decided to become involved in the trading \u201ccommunity.\u201d This includes hosting meet-ups, a graduate group where I received my trading education, as well developing Precision Trading Laboratories, a trading-connected business with my friend and business partner Ryan here in the traderoom.<\/p>\n<p>I'm currently a co-organizer in another NYC trading meet-up I'm quite proud of, but when I saw NYCTTT was dormant I decided to step up. I've got some ideas about shepherding a trading meet-up that's not only a stand-alone monthly meeting, but also a trading community that will benefit all involved.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Why do this?<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>I have a passion for trading and the markets. I enjoy talking about them and interacting with others with the same passion.<\/p>\n<p>I remember how I felt when I was trying to find my way. To help others through this always makes me feel good. Seeing the light-bulb go off over someone's head or getting a phone call about how someone's P&amp;L has gone green is gratifying and fun. I was recently at a trading social function with a successful student of mine and hearing him glowingly describe me as his mentor was a great feeling.<\/p>\n<p>I am always learning from others. Putting together a group of intermediate and advanced traders and committed, dedicated beginners can be a fantastic mix if correctly done. <\/p>\n<p>The act of teaching and preparing for presentations forces me to constantly evaluate my process and makes be better able to react, analyze and explain trading scenarios. This makes me sharper, more knowledgeable, and makes me a better trader. With the reboot of NYCTTT, those in the group who present their knowledge and lead discussions will find the same benefits.<\/p>\n<p>I love trading. Having said that, for many it's a solitary endeavor, which led me to the traderoom. Little did I know that not only would it be socially better, but it accelerated my progress. While I was successful with stocks and options, I was less so with futures. That all changed sitting next to my buddy Ryan here for six months. That sort of effect can arise within this group with the right structure, an extension of the group now being worked on, and interest and commitment from our members.<\/p>\n<p>I've got some ideas about turning this meet-up into a living trading community and I'd love to work with interested members to get this off the ground. As I said, I work out of a traderoom in Midtown West that can host this group early weekday evenings, and have some thoughts about how to extend the group beyond the in-person meet-up..<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<i><b>Come join us!!!<\/b><\/i><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/3\/5\/0\/highres_438749520.jpeg","photo_id":438749520,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/3\/5\/0\/600_438749520.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/3\/5\/0\/thumb_438749520.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":43499082,"name":"Mitch Firestone"},"members":256,"name":"NYC Technical Trader Talks","id":10010282,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Technical-Trader-Talks","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Traders"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1377713420000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"screenwriters","name":"Screenwriting","id":567},{"urlkey":"movies","name":"Watching Movies","id":1201},{"urlkey":"livemusic","name":"Live Music","id":8652},{"urlkey":"film","name":"Film","id":15029},{"urlkey":"reading","name":"Reading","id":15360},{"urlkey":"film-festivals","name":"Film Festivals","id":18495},{"urlkey":"concerts","name":"Concerts","id":18909},{"urlkey":"film-and-video-production","name":"Film and Video Production","id":20021},{"urlkey":"dinner-and-a-movie","name":"Dinner and a Movie","id":23778},{"urlkey":"filmmakers-screenwriters-other-film-crew","name":"Filmmakers, Screenwriters & Other Film Crew","id":38598},{"urlkey":"indie-filmmaking","name":"Indie Filmmaking","id":152559},{"urlkey":"screenwriter","name":"screenwriter","id":167861},{"urlkey":"short-films-for-film-festivals","name":"Short Films for Film Festivals","id":1058452}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Indie-Films-Fans\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Lovers of film<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":108773642,"name":"Gary T."},"members":197,"name":"Indie Films Fans","id":10010342,"state":"NY","urlname":"Indie-Films-Fans","category":{"name":"movies\/film","id":20,"shortname":"movies-film"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Filmmakers & Actors"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1377713794000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"homeschool","name":"Homeschooling","id":603},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"workingmoms","name":"Working Moms","id":10555},{"urlkey":"working-parents","name":"Working Parents","id":15786},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"school","name":"School","id":17017},{"urlkey":"school-age-children","name":"School-Age Kids","id":17705},{"urlkey":"public-school","name":"Public School","id":20182},{"urlkey":"single-parties","name":"Single Parents","id":59433},{"urlkey":"middle-school","name":"Middle School","id":72327},{"urlkey":"high-school","name":"High School","id":101296},{"urlkey":"nyc-parents","name":"NYC parents","id":164729},{"urlkey":"middle-school-parents","name":"middle school parents","id":426582}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-High-School-Admissions-101\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group is dedicated to providing support and resources for families thinking about or going through NYC high school admissions.

It's all about energy \u2014 Inner Energy \u2014 and everyone has it. Sahaja Meditation is a simple technique that lets you tap into that energy and harness its power to become better balanced and better connected to yourself \u2014 emotionally, physically, and spiritually. It's easy. Anyone can do it. And classes are always free.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Here are just a few specific benefits Sahaja Meditation offers\u2026<br>\n\n \u2022 Immediate stress relief and long-term stress management<br>\n\n \u2022 Improve physical and emotional health and boost long-term resilience<br>\n\n \u2022 Improve overall personality and relationships<br>\n\n \u2022 Balance personal and professional responsibilities<br>\n\n \u2022 Take control of your life; control negative emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety, guilt<br>\n\n \u2022 Improve cognitive functioning: focus, clarity, decision-making and problem-solving skills, enhanced creativity<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>What is Sahaja Meditation?<\/strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n How does Sahaja Meditation differ from other popular forms of meditation? On the surface, Sahaja Meditation has a lot in common with other forms of meditation. But what's unique to Sahaja is the ability to awaken and connect to your Inner Energy and influence the movement of this energy up through your body's seven primary energy centers to achieve physical and emotional well-being and ultimately establish a spiritual connection.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>How does energy flow work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Inner Energy flows through each of your energy centers or chakras, energizing, nurturing and balancing them. Think of your Inner Energy system as a flute with seven holes \u2014 each hole representing a chakra, and your Inner Energy representing the air that is blown through the flute. If the flute's holes are unobstructed, the flute can produce melodious, harmonious music in the hands of a skilled musician. And so it is with your chakras. When they're clear and free of obstructions, your Inner Energy flows through your body smoothly, achieving a harmonious balance.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Once your Inner Energy has been awakened, you'll find that Sahaja Meditation makes it easy to fall into the state of meditation, rather than having to perform meditation, as is the case with many forms of meditation. Most forms of meditation don't allow you to easily actualize the energy on Day 1. The reason is that Sahaja Meditation has the unique ability to achieve the powerful state of thoughtless awareness, quickly and effortlessly. What is thoughtless awareness? Think of it as purified attention, a state of maximum energy flow during which your mind is calmed and gradually emptied of all distractions and negative thoughts and feelings. Sahaja Meditation techniques allow you to extend that fraction-of-a-second gap between one thought and the next to remain in a thoughtless state for as long as you wish. Thoughtless awareness \u2014 mental silence \u2014 is a much-needed break from the thoughts that constantly bombard us all day long.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Recent studies conducted by Dr. Ramesh Manocha suggest that thoughtless awareness or mental silence has more impact, experientially and physiologically, than simple relaxation or generic meditation. Sahaja Meditation's mental silence approach to meditation, when compared to a \u201cnon-mental silence\u201d approach, was shown to be, on average, twice as effective in reducing work-related stress, general depressive symptoms and anxiety. Sahaja is much more than just feeling peaceful and relaxed. If you choose to explore it in depth, it can be a transformative path to achieving your highest potential, reaching a higher plane of knowledge and awareness, and living in peace and contentment.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Physical and emotional health and well-being<\/strong><br>\n\n Recent clinical studies have demonstrated the mental and physical health benefits provided by regular practice of Sahaja. For example:<br>\n\n<br>\n\n \u2022 Stress management and emotional resilience. Stress, in one way or another, contributes to all mental and physical health problems. The sense of inner calm you experience during thoughtless awareness boosts your emotional resilience, which helps you effectively cope with stressful events in the future. Regular meditation activates a built-in stress management mechanism that helps your cope with stressors on an ongoing basis. Thoughtless awareness enables you to influence your Inner Energy; in other words, influence your central nervous system to heal and improve yourself.<br>\n\n \u2022 Depression and anxiety relief. Sahaja Meditation helps relieve depression and anxiety symptoms and has been shown to increase positive emotions by influencing neurochemicals released by the limbic (emotional) system (e.g., beta-endorphins). Sahaja revitalizes energy and restores optimism, peace and contentment. Meditation helps manage anger, relieve fear and anxiety, erase negative thoughts and feelings, improve self-esteem, and restore a sense of balance, self-control and well-being. You're better equipped to confront and solve your problems, rather than just feel guilty about your mistakes.<br>\n\n \u2022 Prevention and treatment of illnesses, including: epilepsy, hypertension and cardiac diseases, asthma and respiratory illnesses, migraine syndrome, and menopausal symptoms<br>\n\n \u2022 Structurally alters the brain. A recent study at Massachusetts General Hospital, (Harvard Medical School teaching hospital), showed that the regular practice of meditation may produce structural changes in areas of the brain associated with attention and sensory processing.<br>\n\n \u2022 Boosts immune system and slows aging. By improving overall health, Sahaja helps your body manufacture more disease-fighting cells (T-cells). Thoughtless awareness, combined with the ongoing nourishent of Inner Energy, helps slow aging by keeping your mind and body revitalized and rejuvenated. The Mass General study also showed that meditation may help slow aging by reducing thinning of the cortex.<br>\n\n \u2022 Reduction of Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactive Disorder symptoms, such as attention deficit problems, impulsiveness, hyperactivity and conflict in interpersonal relationships in all settings (school, workplace, social and family). Family-oriented AD\/HD studies of meditation have also shown that parents reported feeling happier, less stressed and better able to manage their child\u2019s behavior.<br>\n\n \u2022 Pain reduction. NIH-funded neuroimaging studies found that long-term meditation can mitigate the brain's response to pain by 40 to 50 percent. In other words, meditation is actually capable of modifying how the brain perceives pain, which could be good news for chronic pain sufferers.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n It's important to mention that treatment or cure is a coincidental benefit of Sahaja Meditation \u2014 a wonderful byproduct \u2014 not Sahaja's ultimate goal. Healing is not Sahaja's core objective, nor was Sahaja Meditation intended to be a formal system of treatments for diseases and disorders. Having said that, healing \u2014 and long-term wellness \u2014 begins with harnessing your own untapped energy. So at the very least, Sahaja Meditation is a great place to start.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Personal Development, Self-Actualization, Personality and Relationships<br>\n\n Sahaja Meditation increases self-awareness, intuition and introspectiveness \u2014 all qualities that improve your communication skills and increase your compassion and empathy for others. Once you've awakened your Inner Energy through meditation, your attention turns inward \u2014 deep inside yourself, to your own energy centers. Through your own internal process of self-awareness and self-realization, your sensitivity to the feelings of others feelings automatically increases and it becomes easier to put yourself in someone else's shoes. You're better able to visualize and understand how others might feel or anticipate someone's reactions to your own words and deeds.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n You begin to focus more on how to improve yourself. You focus on self-improvement through introspection and self-examination, rather than seeking solutions externally through other people, situations, or circumstances. This alone brings about powerful personality changes and builds a foundation for positive interactions with others and strong, pure relationships. The people around you quickly notice your improved attitude, and that you are surrounded by an aura of peace and contentment. You become peaceful from within. As meditation continues to nourish your energy centers over time, people find you to be pleasant to be around and view you as someone who has valuable advice to offer.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Sahaja Meditation techniques can teach you to gauge the state of your own energy centers and become adept at pinpointing the location of blockages (known as 'catches'). Each energy center is associated with a set of qualities. So a problem in an energy center means a problem with the quality associated with that center.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n You'll have live and constant feedback of what's going on with your mind and body \u2014 a powerful self-diagnostic tool that allows you to quickly pinpoint and solve problems. Sahaja helps you analyze your own feelings \u2014 whether positive or negative \u2014 and determine what's triggering them. Negative emotions fade (e.g., feeling guilty for past mistakes) and the trajectory of your life becomes an ascending spiral.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>The spiritual face of Sahaja Meditation<\/strong><br>\n\n For those who choose to explore its depths, Sahaja Meditation can deliver benefits on two powerful dimensions: (1) the rejuvenating experiential aspect and true improvement of oneself and; (2) growth and understanding of spiritual knowledge. Regular practice of Sahaja Meditation can illuminate the true meaning of spirituality and what the journey of spirituality can mean in your life, not tethered to any religion or \"rules.\" The ability to influence the subtle energy system is a thoroughly modern solution with origins revealed in ancient scriptures more than 14,000 years ago. Sahaja can open up a whole world of knowledge known to very few. Attempting to fully articulate the Sahaja spiritual experience is like trying to describe the magnificent beauty of the ocean floor in all its living, miraculous complexity to someone who's standing on the shore, asking what lies beneath the surface of the ocean. No matter how hard you try to describe what can be found in the depths of the ocean, it can only be truly experienced if you dive to those depths yourself.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>What to expect from a Sahaja Meditation class<\/strong><br>\n\n First, all classes are free, no strings attached. There's nothing to buy, now or ever. It's against Sahaja principles to charge money for helping others awaken the energy that we were all born with. Sahaja instructors feel that spirituality should not be equated with money and commerce.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>And Sahaja Meditation is a \"family practice.\"<\/strong> We welcome all ages. Walk-ins are welcome.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Overview. The primary focus of Sahaja Meditation classes, especially for beginners, is awakening and experiencing the energy with the goal of achieving thoughtless awareness or mental silence. We'll provide a brief overview of the subtle energy system so that you can understand the sensations you feel within your body and correlate your experience to real physical and mental attributes. But experience is always valued over knowledge. In other words, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, not in learning how to make elaborate pudding recipes or discussing how wonderful the pudding tastes.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n If you continue to practice Sahaja Meditation, you'll discover and experience, step by step, your own energy centers and their associated qualities. Once you're able to consistently feel the energy and have experienced noticeable differences in your cognitive and emotional states, you can explore more advanced techniques, such as clearing and healing the chakras. You'll learn how the energy centers play a vital role in our evolutionary process of becoming better human beings and experience holistic improvement on all planes \u2014 physical, cognitive, emotional and spiritual. In the ultimate and most advanced phases, you may choose to use Sahaja Meditation to discover your inner spiritual self and how you can evolve to higher realms of spirituality. For many, Sahaja is much more than just a temporary solution or quick relief. It is a journey, rather than a destination.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Ultimately, Sahaja classes can provide a complete course on meditation and spirituality, which you can continue to experiment with and verify at every step. Just as no two life experiences are exactly alike, no two Sahaja Meditation experiences are exactly alike. You can explore at your own pace, in your own way. There are no rules, restrictions or rituals. Sahaja is entirely Do-It-Yourself. And I'm always available to help.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n There's no pressure to continue attending classes. You can come once or twice and never come back again or you can attend classes weekly. Many find that attending classes weekly is just what they need to recharge their batteries.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n About our sessions. Classes are conducted in a peaceful environment; soothing background music helps facilitate meditation. Meditations are guided by instructors and are designed to accommodate the collective experience. Individual assistance (both beginner and advanced) is always available. While the actual practice of meditation forms the core of our sessions, sessions may also include discussions of, for example, specific aspects of the subtle energy system. But it's not all \"serious.\" There's also plenty of opportunity to enjoy casual conversations and share experiences with others.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n The power of collective meditation. Collective meditation in an optimized environment can be exhilarating and rejuvenating. In fact, generally, the larger the group, the better the experience. Once you have awakened your Inner Energy, you may find that the benefits of meditation are compounded when you meditate in a group of people who are \"on the same frequency;\" i.e., connecting to the collective universal energy at the same time and place. Think of it as a network of computer servers linked to each other\u2026 each can access and share resources of the other, and as a group, they form a powerful network of resources. Collective meditation is also likely to help you progress faster in the initial weeks, as compared to meditating at home, alone.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Meditating at home. You can meditate anytime in any quiet environment. Once your Inner Energy has been awakened, the technique simply involves easing into the state of meditation to raise the energy, then gradually easing out of it to carry on with your day. You're likely to find your solo meditations to be much more beneficial if you have first attended a class where expert Sahaja practitioners are on hand to help.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n What Sahaja Meditation holds in store for you, personally, is up to you. You can devote as much time to it or as little as you wish. But like everything else in life, the benefits you reap will generally be commensurate with the amount of time and effort you invest. As with a physical fitness program, for example, you must have knowledge and understanding of the techniques, as well as the motivation and maturity to pursue the fitness routine. You must enter into the experience with an open mind, a belief that it can work and a willingness to work, or the program won't achieve a high level of success. And as with any physical fitness program you undertake, meditation results may vary, depending on variables such as how fit you are when you begin the program and how hard you work on an ongoing basis. But typically, two 10 to 15-minute-sessions per day will yield significant benefits.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Contact us at 973-506-9515 or send us a message for any questions.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Visit www.sahajameditation.com, www.sahajameditationbenefits.com for more details.<\/p>","lon":-74.3799972534,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/9\/0\/highres_277668272.jpeg","photo_id":277668272,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/9\/0\/600_277668272.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/9\/0\/thumb_277668272.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12407024,"name":"Nirmal K Mukhi"},"members":110,"name":"The Morris County Sahaja Meditation Group","id":10049382,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Morris-County-Meditation","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Meditation Practitioners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1377987030000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript","id":7029},{"urlkey":"ria","name":"Rich Internet Applications","id":9886},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"ext-js","name":"Ext JS","id":70707},{"urlkey":"mobile-web","name":"Mobile Web","id":78586},{"urlkey":"javascript-frameworks","name":"JavaScript Frameworks","id":85951},{"urlkey":"sencha-touch","name":"Sencha Touch","id":116642},{"urlkey":"sencha-ext-js","name":"Sencha Ext JS","id":116856},{"urlkey":"sencha","name":"Sencha","id":129312},{"urlkey":"cross-platform-mobile","name":"Cross-platform Mobile","id":846132}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Sencha-Users\/","rating":3,"description":"<p>The purpose of this group is to bring smart people together and learn how to develop amazing apps with Ext JS and Sencha Touch.

(ABSC), formerly known as the American Buddhist Academy, was founded in 1951 by the late Reverend Hozen Seki as a Buddhist cultural center. Rev. Seki sought to provide a Buddhist study center for people interested in learning more about the Buddhist teachings with particular emphasis toward Shin Buddhism.<\/p>\n<p>The Center is located on Riverside Drive near 105th Street on the upper West Side of New York City immediately adjacent to the New York Buddhist Temple. It is within walking distance to many of New York\u2019s finest schools and universities including Columbia, Barnard, Manhattan College, City College, NYU and theological seminaries.<\/p>\n<p>ABSC runs a full schedule of Buddhist programs and events throughout the year. From lecturer series, workshops, book discussion groups to afternoon movie series. Besides these activities the Center also publishes the Natural Way newsletter, booklets and other publications.<\/p>\n<p>The crown jewel of the center is its Buddhist reference and research library. There are over ten thousand volumes of Buddhist texts, manuscripts, and sutras. Many in the ABSC collection are very rare and priceless. There are books on Tibet Buddhism, Pure Land Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism, Japanese Shin and Zen Buddhism. ABSC has one of the best Buddhist collections of Shin Buddhist works on the East Coast.<\/p>\n<p>Through the years many famous Buddhist scholars have given lectures and workshops at the center. One of the most notable was D.T. Suzuki, who in 1958 gave a series of lectures that were published by Harper and Row entitled Shin Buddhism, in 1970. Then a second edition was later published by Shambhala in a new introduction by Taitetsu Unno, entitled Buddha of Infinite Light.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shinran Shonin Statue<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Today in front of the New York Buddhist Church stands a fifteen foot high bronze statue of Shinran Shonin, the founder of Shin Buddhism. This statue was a generous gift from Mr. Hirose, a Japanese industrialist, to the American Buddhist Academy. During WWII the Shinran Shonin statue stood in front of a Buddhist temple in Hiroshima. As metals became scarce in Japan many bronze statues and ornaments were melted down to be used for the war effort. The Shinran Shonin statue survived, while other Buddhist and religious ornaments were not so lucky. Then on August 6, 1946, the Shinran Shonin statue withstood its greatest test by surviving the Atomic bomb blast over Hiroshima. After the war Mr. Hirose wanted this statue to represent world peace, and Rev. Seki convinced Mr. Hirose to ship it to New York City, the crossroads of the world. On September 11, 1955, the statue was unveiled in the courtyard of the American Buddhist Academy. There D.T. Suzuki gave his key note address for world peace and harmony. This year, 2008 marks the 53rd anniversary of the occasion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is Shin Buddhism, also known as Jodo Shinshu<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The most important realization for Shin Buddhists is the attainment of shinjin, which occurs in our present life. Shinjin is true entrusting in the Immeasurable Life and Light of the compassionate Amida Buddha and the Primal Vow. This spiritual transformation takes place in our present life, not after death. We become aware of the oneness with all life surrounding us through our deepened understanding of the basic tenets of Buddhism, which include the Four Noble Truths, Eightfold paths, dependent origination, and impermanence. For the Shin Buddhist to realize this oneness is due to the working of Other Power, which is none other then Amida\u2019s Primal Vow. It is within this Vow that we take notice of our intimate interconnectedness with others and with all life. As Shinran Shonin wrote in 1250 \u201cThus, when we simply let the karmic retribution of whatever good or evil we might have play itself out, and we turn to believe solely in the true vow, that is other power.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span>The New York Buddhist Church (NYBC) is a temple of Jodoshinshu True Pure Land School Buddhism, whose head temple is Nishi-Hongwanji Temple in Kyoto, Japan. Shinran Shonin (1173-1262) is the founder of this school of Buddhism.<\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span>The NYBC has been serving the New York community since 1938, and was founded by Rev. Hozen Seki with the assistance of his wife, Satomi, and concerned lay people. They all wished to share the Buddha-Dharma in America's most populous city, which then had no center for Jodoshinshu Buddhism. Their wishes have flourished as today we continue to share the Buddha-Dharma here in New York.<\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span>May the Wisdom and Compassion of Amida Buddha touch your heart so that you may be awakened to the world of True Dharma with Nembutsu.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/8\/c\/6\/highres_279786342.jpeg","photo_id":279786342,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/8\/c\/6\/600_279786342.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/8\/c\/6\/thumb_279786342.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":1512390,"name":"Mariko"},"members":169,"name":"American Buddhist Study Center and New York Buddhist Church","id":10108852,"state":"NY","urlname":"ABSCNYBC","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Attendees"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1378337760000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"polyamory","name":"Polyamory","id":494},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"intimacy","name":"Intimacy","id":15187},{"urlkey":"human-sexuality","name":"Human Sexuality","id":17854},{"urlkey":"open-relationships","name":"Open Relationships","id":19785},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"swingers-parties","name":"Swingers Parties","id":22971},{"urlkey":"nudist-naturists","name":"Naturist","id":23517},{"urlkey":"alternative-lifestyles","name":"Alternative Lifestyles","id":24818},{"urlkey":"kinky","name":"Kinky","id":28523},{"urlkey":"swinger","name":"Swingers","id":61474},{"urlkey":"celebrate-sensuality","name":"Sensuality","id":93385},{"urlkey":"kinky-fetishes-bdsm","name":"Kinky - Fetishes & BDSM","id":165968},{"urlkey":"polyamory-and-open-relationships","name":"Polyamory and Open Relationships","id":167798}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Scene-NYC\/","rating":3,"description":"<p>Over the years we\u2019ve successfully harnessed all that an underground playground has to offer.

Although it is a fast and energetic dance, it flows smoothly and the moves are continuous and rhythmic, and dancers follow circular movements as they relate to each other. One way in which the present Porto-Seguro style differs from the orig<span>inal Kaoma-like Lambada style, is that the they have removed wiggling shoulder movements (also sometimes seen in Cuban-style salsa). Instead the shoulders are kept fixed while the hips move (swing) to create a sensual effect. A number of movements have been added to the modern version of this dance (many created by Didi Santos of Brazil). Porto Seguro style is so prominent in Lambazouk that the two are often considered synonymous, not to mention, even the most celebrated Porto Seguro dancers call themselves Lambazouk dancers.<br>\n\nLambazouk is characterized by the following movements:<br>\n\n<br>\n\nCabe\u00e7a.<br>\n\nBoneca.<br>\n\nChicote.<br>\n\nCambre.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nLambazouk is danced to rhythmic, up-tempo music (tempo is generally fast or medium, rarely slow). Kizomba music is very popular in Lambazouk owing to its rhythm and pace. Because the music faster, and head movements are more sophisticated and done more often, dancing Lambazouk requires better technique and timing in order to perform head movements without injuries.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nLambazouk is mainly danced in Porto Seguro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Argentina, Spain, Israel, UK, US, Israel, Japan &amp; recently also in Malaysia. LambaZouk is also evolving to include more modern movements. It is also not uncommon (lately) for dancers to switch fluently between these dancing styles during a single Zouk music song.<\/span><\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/9\/2\/highres_348498322.jpeg","photo_id":348498322,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/9\/2\/600_348498322.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/9\/2\/thumb_348498322.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8379582,"name":"Hisa"},"members":98,"name":"Dan\u00e7a Brasil, Lambazouk, Samba e Forro","id":10135062,"state":"NY","urlname":"Danca-Brasileira-Zouk-Lambada-Samba-e-Forro","category":{"name":"dancing","id":5,"shortname":"dancing"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Dancers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1378477302000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"screenwriters","name":"Screenwriting","id":567},{"urlkey":"indiefilm","name":"Indie Films","id":914},{"urlkey":"film-and-video-production","name":"Film and Video Production","id":20021},{"urlkey":"local-filmmakers","name":"Local Filmmakers","id":22984},{"urlkey":"gorilla-filmmaking-film-shorts-for-film-festivals","name":"Gorilla filmmaking, Film shorts for Film Festivals","id":26000},{"urlkey":"film-production","name":"Film Production","id":26681},{"urlkey":"film-makers","name":"Filmmaking","id":31082},{"urlkey":"independent-filmmakers","name":"Independent Filmmaking","id":48847},{"urlkey":"online-filmmaking","name":"Online Filmmaking","id":64061},{"urlkey":"micro-budget-filmmaking","name":"Micro Budget Filmmaking","id":76190},{"urlkey":"allowing-filmmakers-to-improve-their-skills","name":"Allowing Filmmakers to Improve their Skills","id":78403},{"urlkey":"low-budget-filmmaking","name":"Low Budget Filmmaking","id":124947},{"urlkey":"indie-filmmaking","name":"Indie Filmmaking","id":152559},{"urlkey":"guerilla-filmmaking","name":"Guerilla Filmmaking","id":249101},{"urlkey":"filmmaking-network","name":"filmmaking network","id":640022}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Zorkas-Creatives\/","rating":3.75,"description":"<p>Our group is dedicated to helping new creatives take that first step in creating a career in film and photography.

If the group grows, I'll schedule more frequent runs to accommodate everyone's demand and schedule. My pace for runs of 1-3 miles is usually about 10min\/mile. Hoping to get that to improve, but the point is, this group is for people who are not serious athletes looking to compete. That being said, we might look into some 5K's for fun... but that will be optional for whichever members are interested.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Also, I encourage members to take the lead and schedule runs so we can cover different neighborhoods, fitness levels, and schedules.
