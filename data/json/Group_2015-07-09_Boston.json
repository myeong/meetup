La gente es s\u00faper simp\u00e1tica y el grupo nos da chance de conocer a otras personas con intereses internacionales. La mayoria hablan espa\u00f1ol como primer idioma o avanzado pero siempre vienen algunos de todo nivel quienes se encuentran unos a otros. \u00a0 Hablamos completamente en espa\u00f1ol.<\/p>\n<p>Las reuniones son oportunidades informales para conocer y charlar con otros miembros del grupo. \u00a0Tenemos varios eventos para complacer a diferentes intereses. \u00a0Siempre estamos buscando nuevot organizadors, asi que si te animes, manda un mensaje a Kaela.<\/p>\n<p>Ahora conectate con nosotros en Facebook: \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/meetupdeboston\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/meetupdeboston<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Nota sobre finanzas: Cobramos $10 por a\u00f1o o $1 por evento a cada miembro para apoyar en los gastos de nuestra pagina de meetup ($144\/a\u00f1o) y de las etiquetas. De vez en cuando tambien negocios nos apatrocinan pagando los gastos de la pagina por un periodo de 6 meses, por ejemplo ahora con MasSpanish (es posible en el futuro que existen otras formas de patrocinio, pero por ahora esto es). Cuando tenemos patrocinio y tambien mucha gente asistiendo los eventos de Cambridge, recibo mas de lo que necesito para cubrir gastos. He decidido que cuando esto pasa, donare el dinero extra a Common Hope (www.commonhope.org), una ONG fantastico en Guatemala. Espero que les parezca este arreglo. Para mi resulta un \"win-win\" - es poca la contribucion de cada uno, pero siempre tengo lo necesario para cubrir gastos, y tambien hay otros beneficiarios en Guatemala.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a1Bienvenidos!<\/p>",

Write up your introduction in several lines. As for language skill set, you could say \"English - Native, Japanese - Beginner\" or vice versa. <span>We may decline your application if it doesn't tell much about you<\/span>...<\/p>\n<p><strong>We are not a Dating club.<\/strong> A lot of boys and girls come to our event, and we understand you may find someone very attractive.

So <span>We would appreciate you to make a small donation, if you are attending our events frequently and enjoy being there.<\/span> We setup 90 days as free trial period, and if you enjoy attending our event after the trial period, member due can be made from our home page, \"Member Dues $5.00 yearly\" link on left side bar. Member dues are mainly used for Meetup website cost. If member dues are funded more than enough to cover website cost, we might plan to do special event to appreciate your support. However, if we meet at a restaurant, people pay individually at the end. Some venues, such as a karaoke club, would have an equally shared cost.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>MA Korean Language &amp; Culture Group is open to anybody in the greater Boston area who is interested in the Korean language and culture. While this group is intended for learning Korean, we have speakers of other Asian languages such as Chinese and Japanese too. Our meeting is truly multi-cultural, with conversation happening in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese. If you speak one of these languages and if you are interested in the Korean language and culture, we are positive that you will have fun in this group. We are looking forward to seeing you soon! <br> <br><\/p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ AND AGREE WITH THE RULES BELOW BEFORE YOU JOIN THIS GROUP<\/strong> <br> <br><\/p>\n<p>MA Korean Language &amp; Culture Group mission statement, policies and rules <br> <br>MA Korean Language &amp; Culture Group is open to anybody who is interested in the Korean language and culture. The mission of this group is to provide members with fun and safe environment to meet people with the same interest. All activities in this group are done on a non-profit basis. We intend to keep this group as open and casual as possible. Therefore, we restrict our group policies and rules to the following very basic ones. <br> <br>1. <br>To be a member, you will need to go to our Meetup\u00ae website <a href=\"http:\/\/korean.meetup.com\/7\/\"><\/a><a><\/a><a>http:\/\/korean.meetup<\/a>.... and create a profile and introduce yourself. Any profile with no introduction will be deleted periodically. The reason why this is done is stated on <a href=\"http:\/\/korean.meetup.com\/7\/messages\/boards\/view\/viewthread?thread=2652593\"><\/a><a><\/a><a>http:\/\/korean.meetup<\/a>.... <br> <br>2. <br>This group engages in non-profit meetings and activities with the intention solely to promote friendship and cultural\/ linguistic exchange of participating members. Any commercial activities within the group are strictly prohibited. With the exceptions of collecting the actual cost of food\/beverages incurred in the meetings and any voluntary contributions made to the management of the group, no fees shall be collected from the members. <br> <br>3. <br>The regular meeting is generally held on the first Saturday of the month at a location announced only to the members registered on the Meetup\u00ae website. The monthly meeting is open to all members of the group. There are also additional sporadic spin-off BBQ parties, excursions, movie nights etc. The regular attendees of the group\u2019s monthly meetings receive prioritized invitations for these spin-off meetings because of the space limitation. <br> <br>4. <br>The mission of this group is to promote friendship and cultural\/linguistic exchange of participating members regardless of their nationalities, linguistic, cultural, ethnic or religious backgrounds. With the mission of our group as such, it is expected that members refrain from making comments and discussions that are considered to be offensive to or attacking\/criticizing any particular nationalities, people from particular linguistic, cultural, ethnic or religious backgrounds. What is considered offensive or attacking\/criticizing can sometimes be a subjective matter. However, as a group, we have our own commonly shared unwritten standards. The group has the right to warn, suspend or disqualify any member if our group policies and rules are not observed. <br> <br>5. <br>As this is a non-profit group managed and operated by a small number of volunteers, successful meetings depend largely on your participation and cooperation. Please make sure to RSVP for our meeting at least a couple of days in advance on our Meetup\u00ae website. Please try your best to come on time to the venue. This is especially important when the venue is a restaurant and a reservation has been made for the meeting. Please make sure to research on the transportation to the venue on your own. It is your responsibility to arrive at the venue on time safely. <br> <br>As you can see above, the policies and rules in this group come from the common sense. <br> <br>Simply put, the rules are; <br> <br>1. Introduce yourself when you join the group. <br>2. Do not make money from the group. <br>3. Regular meeting is normally held on the first Saturday of the month. <br>4. Be nice to other members. <br>5. Plan and show up on time on your own. <br> <br>Again, it is our intention to keep this group as open and casual as possible. We believe the common sense rules stated above are already practiced by most members. However, with the increasing number of new members joining the group, we took this opportunity to reiterate them formally. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions. <br> <br>MA Korean Language Group<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Mandarin Chinese conversation practice group, for all levels. The group is open and self-led. When we run out of vocabulary, we chat about China in English :) Welcome native speakers who would like to meet conversation partners, or lead activities.<\/p>\n<p>Housekeeping:<\/p>\n<p>Here are some guidelines to keep the group functioning smoothly, information on the site easy to find, and keep emails to a minimum. Thanks in advance for reading these and complying!<\/p>\n<p>Meetups:<\/p>\n<p>Members are welcome to suggest events and encouraged to host. Approval is at discretion of the lead Organizer. Events that consist of Mandarin conversation opportunities or are primarily in Mandarin are on-topic and will likely be approved. Events that relate to Chinese or Asian American culture may be permitted on a case by case basis. A Meetup is an event where group members meet each other to do something. Events hosted by outside agencies or other groups are NOT Meetups, unless there is a specific meeting time and location set for members to go together. If you'd like to share a Meetup from another group, please check first with the host and if they agree, you can post on our Discussion section for our members. Duplicate events from other Meetup groups will only be allowed at discretion of lead Organizer, and should only be rsvp'd to once by any member. Any cost must be clearly noted in the beginning of the description. Any event that is NOT primarily Mandarin language practice must be marked \"OT\" (off-topic) in the title line.<\/p>\n<p>Resources:<\/p>\n<p>If you'd like to share resources for language learning or other community notices or events, please post in the Discussion section. Anything OT for our group but related, may be a useful post. If it is too far OT it will be deleted. Commercial and business posts are not welcome here, sorry. Do not advertise your tutoring services. You are welcome to state in your member profile if you tutor or teach but no business information nor soliciting members, please. Free events at language schools, or open houses may be permitted. If a member wishes to post a review of a Mandarin language learning program or resource they have used, please do so in Discussion section.<\/p>\n<p>Members:<\/p>\n<p>Many of our members are in the US, or in MA, for brief time periods. Please delete your membership if you have left the group or the area- it helps keep the list up to date. Members inactive over six months are subject to deletion anytime. If you wish to stay in the group please remember to visit the page and reply occasionally in order to keep your profile active.<\/p>\n<p>Language exchange partners:<\/p>\n<p>Please do not post for conversation partners with any personal contact info on the site! You are welcome to post for members in your area, and to attend a Meetup to meet in person. Many language exchange partnerships have begun at Meetup events. Be sure to meet the person first before deciding to exchange any personal contact info and use your common sense, for example meeting at public places.<\/p>\n<p>Photos:<\/p>\n<p>Pictures of our members at Meetups are welcome, no more than 10 from each event please. Photos will be deleted at Organizer's discretion if inappropriate, irrelevant to the group's mission, or otherwise judged unsuitable to this group by the Organizer. A picture of the Meetup location or food, for future event planning, might be approved by the Organizer for posting. Or a snap or two of a cultural performance. Or they might not. Thanks in advance for keeping it relevant.<\/p>\n<p>Wishing you the best in your studies, see you soon!<\/p>\n<p>Reece<\/p>",

To join the fist time to the skype calls please send a skype contact request to Andras (skype id: \"andras.pap\", and be logged into skype at the time of the call). New texts are always discussed first on Skype, attending both or either of the two types of meetings is encouraged. Probably the best way to learn about us is to check out our past events in the \"Past\" tab on our \"Home\" page and our \"BPMU_ReadingList\" and \"NearFuturePlan\" files on our \"Files\" page. Come and join the discussion. (Don't let the background image discourage you.)<\/p>",

        "description": "<p><em><strong>Welcome to Boston Wine Meetup Group<\/strong><\/em>!<\/p>\n<p>This group is dedicated to all that is wine. Welcome. Whether you are just learning how to hold your glass, are a casual wine drinker, or a passionate expert, we are happy to have you on board.<\/p>\n<p>Our events range from informal tastings at Boston-area restaurants and wine stores, to large formal events, movies, socials, food and wine pairings, dessert wines, reds, whites, ros\u00e9s, Old World vs. New World wines, wine terroir vs. varietals, the language of the label, wine-related travel, lectures, history, cooking with wine...<\/p>\n<p>BostonWine is a \"big-tent\" group, so we welcome anyone and everyone who enjoys the pleasures of table. Come and share a bottle with us.<\/p>\n<p>the organizers<\/p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p>\n<p><strong>BostonWine Group Policies and Disclaimer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You must agree to ALL of our policies to be a member of our group and attend our events.<\/p>\n<p>LEGAL DRINKING AGE REQUIRED<\/p>\n<p><span>You must be of legal drinking age to be a member of our group. By requesting and continuing membership, you swear and affirm that you are over the age of 21. Further, any guests you bring to our events must be 21+ as well. If you intentionally or unintentionally misrepresent your age, or the age of a guest in order to provide alcohol to a person under the age of 21, the organizers will ban you from the group and possibly notify the proper authorities. Please have a photo ID handy when you come to one of our events.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>DRUNKEDNESS NOT TOLERATED<\/p>\n<p>Drinking alcohol is a normal activity of this group, but getting drunk is NOT! We expect our members and their guests to know their limits and be responsible wine drinkers. Those who over-indulge to the extent that it disrupts an event, raises safety concerns about the member or others at an event, or potentially presents a liability to the group, will be banned from the group.<\/p>\n<p>By being a member of BostonWine, you agree that you and your guests will follow the guidance of the organizers if told to stop drinking, need to leave, take a cab or ride from a fellow member, etc. Further, at the discretion of the organizers, the proper venue or legal authorities may be notified in cases of extreme safety concerns.<\/p>\n<p>AUTHORTY OF ORGANIZERS<\/p>\n<p>The organizers of BostonWine work hard to create and run great events. In some cases the organizers enter into financial understandings with a venue, supplier, or other third party as part of an event. By requesting membership with BostonWine you acknowledge and accept that the organizers are the only persons with the authority to speak for the group, decide who may or may not be a member of our group, decide what events to plan and how to run them. In particular, you agree that the organizer of an event has final authority on how the event is to proceed, what adjustments might have to be made during the event to ensure it is a success, what constitutes proper behavior and generally how to maintain order. \u00a0\u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n PROPER BEHAVOR<\/p>\n<p>BostonWine events generally are casual, educational and fun. We expect all members to behave as responsible adults and show respect for other members, their opinions, similarities as well as their differences. If an issue arises with another member, staff at a meetup venue, or on the group's web site, you agree to notify the organizers and let him\/her handle the situation. Further, you agree under no circumstance to argue or otherwise get into a dispute with another person during an event.<\/p>\n<p>The consumption of alcoholic beverages may impair one's judgments or actions to act responsibly. If a member participates in any action that the organizer deems is harmful or threatening to themselves, another person, animal or property, or whose behavior reflects poorly on BostonWine, that member will be banned from the group.<\/p>\n<p>Our discussion boards, event comments, etc. are not forums for airing personal disputes, and doing will result in your removal from the group. Using our web site to distribute email virus or other malware is a crime and will be reported to proper legal authorities.<\/p>\n<p>FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<\/p>\n<p>Members are responsible for paying their own way and settling their tab before leaving a meetup in a restaurant or other venue where a group tab was open.\u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n GOVERNMENT WARNING ON HEALTH CONSEQUENCES of CONSUMING ALCOHOL<\/p>\n<p>The organizers and our members believe that moderate consumption of wine with food is part of a healthly lifestyle. However, alcohol consumption is ill advised for certain people in certain circumstances. By joining BostonWine, you acknowledge that there is a government warning concerning the health effects of consuming alcoholic beverages: (1) According to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery, and may cause health problems.<\/p>\n<p>MUST HAVE A PROFILE PHOTO<\/p>\n<p>To join or remain in this group ALL Members are required to have a representative main profile photo at all times. A head shot is best, but not required. You will not be able to join without a photo and will be removed for lack thereof. We do this to ensure the safety of our members, but also to simplify the lives of the organizers.<\/p>\n<p>PUBLIC IMAGES<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, members take photographic, digital or video images of event participants and post these images to our web site. You hereby agree to allow the BostonWine group to display those images without expectation of privacy or remuneration. Members are free to request, however, that a particular image of themselves be removed by contacting one of the organizers; final determination of whether the image should be removed however is at the discretion of the organizer.<\/p>\n<p>NO_SHOW POLICY<\/p>\n<p>Most of our events have wait lists due to their popularity. Not showing up to an event that you have RSVP'd to is disrespectful to your fellow members, makes it difficult for the organizer to plan events and may incur financial penalties. As a result, after 3 \"no-shows,\" the organizer may decide to remove you from the group.<\/p>\n<p>DISCLAIMER<\/p>\n<p>By being a member of the BostonWine group you hereby agree to assume all risks and liability related to or resulting from any and all group events, interactions with our meetup web site and other members. You agree that neither you nor any third party will hold any of the group's organizers, members, companies, officers, or representatives liable for any injury, loss, or damage to yourself, your guests or any members of your family, friends, acquaintances, children, pets, or property, arising directly or as a consequence from a group activity.<\/p>\n<p>During all events, everyone is responsible for themselves. The organizers are not responsible for the safety of the participants. We will try our best to prevent accidents, but are not responsible or liable if something happens to you. Be aware of your limits and respect your fellow group members; DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE.<\/p>\n<p>By joining the BostonWine meetup group and remaining a member, you acknowledge and accept these points.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks,<\/p>\n<p>the organizers<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>",

We have a rather ecclectic group and the music will range from pop to rock to oldies to soul to alternative to rap to country. We welcome all types of music.<\/p>\n<p>Some of our members are very good singers and they provide quality entertainment. Other members are just starting out we give them a supportive and encouraging environment to learn. So whether you are a professional or a novice, you would fit right in.

At each meetup that the organizer attends will collect the suggested $3 donation that will go towards the monthly $14.99 fee. In addition you can donate anytime via the \"Chip In\" button on the home page. If at the end of the month, the organizer does not collect enough money through donations, the organizer will pay the difference. If the organizer receives more than enough, the extra money will be banked for use to cover shortages for future months and\/or additional meetup expenses. At the end of the year if there are additional funds available a portion will be rolled over into the next year and a portion will be donated to a Frenchie in need at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.frenchbulldogrescue.org\/\">French Bulldog Rescue Network<\/a>.<\/p>",

This is a group that will provide you opportunities to meet others and make bonds, both for yourself and for children, which can last a lifetime!<\/p>\n<p>The annual fee is $21 and gives you access to our calendar of many events, message board, many clubs including Supper Club, Cooking Crew, Not Just Sushi Night, Motherless Mothers, and several Momtourage sponsored (free to members) events and activities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Participation is key to success of the group; therefore, we encourage our members to share their ideas and suggestions and schedule play dates.<\/strong> Be sure to check our Message Board for daily updates and share some messages of your own!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #ff00ff\"><strong>PLEASE, before petitioning to join our group<\/strong><\/span>, be sure that your Meetup username is your name (last name not needed) and not initials or combination of letters and numbers.

We're now an \"ATCs+\" group, meaning that our activities&nbsp;are open to people working on other art and craft projects, such as altered books, art journals,&nbsp;greeting cards, etc. (See \"About Us\" for much more detail.)<\/p>\n<p>Our group is open to adult artists and craftspeople (you must be 18+ to join) at all experience levels. Our current members range from professional artists to near-newbies. We&nbsp;offer a variety of demos at our monthly Meetups in Natick, and we're looking to meet more frequently and in other locations. Everyone is welcome at our events--we just ask that you RSVP to let us know you're attending.<\/p>\n<p>This group, which began in mid-2007, has quickly evolved into a lively, highly creative community. As one member puts it: \"You feel like you're 'in the flow' from the moment you walk in the door.\" And yet it's not all about self-expression: Without exception, members have been extraordinarily generous about sharing ideas, techniques and tools.<\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Signing up for events&nbsp;in either Natick or Holliston&nbsp;is easy. Just<\/strong> <strong>join this Meetup group (membership is free). Then&nbsp;RSVP \"yes\" for the events that interest you.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Bottom line: We take art seriously, but we have a LOT of fun. And we welcome newcomers. Join us.<\/p>",

I'd like this group be open to all Organizers & Assistant Organizers so we can help each other to become more successful at running all of our Meetup groups. I know we are spread all over but it would nice to meet monthly in some common area like Waltham. \r\n\r\nAlso, I encourage people to use the message boards to ask questions and to participate in lively discussions to better help us all! I wanted to thank Adam for saving the group and naming me for the Organizer spot. If you are interested in becoming organizer of this group please let me know! Thanks and enjoy.\r\n\r\nNew Note: The group is large and growing, but we are spread all over New England to make meeting in one spot practical. I think its best to use the message boards. We are all busy with work and life so lets make the best of what little free time we do have. Please check message boards often and see if you can help others and also post questions to the group too. Thanks",

(<\/strong><\/span><strong>and&nbsp;p<\/strong><strong>hysical reality is infinitely more interesting than virtual reality).<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>\"<em>There is no life on the internet<\/em> <em>...&nbsp;no sense of space in cyberspace.<\/em>\"<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>:: :: ::<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This group was created to encourage exploration of and participation in cultural and educational opportunities in the Greater Cambridge area and occasionally further afield. All events are open to attendance by anyone. Viewers of this site, whether they choose to join the CMF or not, may attend any of the events.&nbsp; Members may RSVP or not, and still attend events. There are no requirements either&nbsp;for membership or attendance. Members do, however, receive event reminders - and members are encouraged to actually meet up!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>CMF Meet-Ups are <span>member-driven<\/span>; that is, if you want to meet other members, it is up to you, as a member, to post your plans on the event message board. I am not able to attend every event, so if no one posts plans, then no one meets up. This aspect of the CMF can be somewhat empowering since anyone can become the ad-hoc organizer for any event. Just do it <\/strong>(as used to be said).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Please note that \"<\/b><i><b>Featured Events<\/b><\/i><b>\" are not in chronological order ...&nbsp;<\/b>(other events listed further down may be happening at an earlier date). &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>:: :: ::<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Cambridge Moveable Feast is geared more toward Traditional Cultural and Educational opportunities rather than Pop, Abstract, Postmodernist or Techno-Culture.<\/p>\n<p><strong>:: :: ::<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>Note<\/span><\/strong>: If you have a question that doesn't affect the rest of the group, Please email me directly using the link to the left. Everyone else gets enough email as it is. Thanks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><span>Further Note<\/span><\/strong>: Occasionally, events are cancelled by the event sponsor. Should an event be cancelled, it will be removed from the calendar. However, the CMF is not always notified of cancellations. <strong><span>Please confirm<\/span>, <span>prior to attending<\/span>, <span>the time and location of the event from the event sponsor<\/span>.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>Also<\/span><\/strong>: <strong>Some events require pre-registration through the event sponsor. <span>A \"Yes\" RSVP here is NOT pre-registration<\/span>. Attendees must still pre-register individually through the event sponsor.<\/strong> Usually there will be a link to the event sponsor's website for pre-registration.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span>One more thing<\/span>: CMF protocol suggests that members only wear official CMF sleeveless tee-shirts when it is appropriate to the venue and the event.<\/strong> The preferred method of fabrication is to cut the sleeves off of a regular tee-shirt and hand-print the CMF acronym , somewhat legibly, on either the front or back of the shirt (or both, as you wish)&nbsp;with an indelible marking pen. Members who submit selfies with CMF sleeveless tee-shirts will receive two complimentary CMF pin-on buttons ... (and will also qualify to learn the secret CMF handshake).<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/a\/c\/8\/event_253071912.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><span>The&nbsp;Cambridge Moveable Feast&nbsp;has no political, commercial, academic or spiritual affiliations of any kind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>:: :: ::<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you care about the future of this planet, click here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.idealist.org\/if\/i\/en\/av\/Org\/180146-21\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.idealist.org\/if\/i\/en\/av\/Org\/180146-21\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.idealist.org\/if\/i\/en\/av\/Org\/180146-21\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.idealist.org\/if\/i\/en\/av\/Org\/180146-21\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.idealist.org\/if\/i\/en\/av\/Org\/180146-21\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.idealist.org\/if\/i\/en\/av\/Org\/180146-21\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.idealist.org\/if\/i\/en\/av\/Org\/180146-21\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.idealist.org\/if\/i\/en\/av\/Org\/180146-21\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.idealist.org\/if\/i\/en\/av\/Org\/180146-21\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.idealist.org\/if\/i\/en\/av\/Org\/180146-21\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.idealist.org\/if\/i\/en\/av\/Org\/180146-21\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.idealist.org\/if\/i\/en\/av\/Org\/180146-21\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.idealist.org\/if\/i\/en\/av\/Org\/180146-21\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.idealist.org\/if\/i\/en\/av\/Org\/180146-21\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.idealist.org\/if\/i\/en\/av\/Org\/180146-21\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.idealist.org\/if\/i\/en\/av\/Org\/180146-21\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.idealist.org\/if\/i\/en\/av\/Org\/180146-21\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sequitoria\/\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sequitoria\/\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sequitoria\/\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sequitoria\/\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sequitoria\/\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sequitoria\/\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sequitoria\/\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sequitoria\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sequitoria\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>:: :: ::<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\"<em>Men <\/em>(sic) <em>have sought to make a world from their own conception and to draw from their own minds all the material which they employed, but if, instead of doing so, they had consulted experience and observation, they would have the facts and not opinions to reason about, and might have ultimately arrived at the knowledge of the laws which govern the material world<\/em>.\" - Francis Bacon<\/p>\n<p><span><strong>:: :: ::<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>\"<em>The society which scorns excellence in plumbing as a humble activity and tolerates shoddiness in philosophy because it is an exalted activity will have neither good plumbing nor good philosophy ... neither its pipes nor its theories will hold water<\/em>.\" - John W.

Come meet other local climbers for outdoor and indoor climbing, and be a part of it!<\/p>\n<p>Our purpose is provide additional social networking opportunities\u00a0for Boston-area climbers of all levels, beginner to advanced, to meet, find more climbing partners, and share climbing-related information.\u00a0 We don't teach novices, or generally offer instructional programs, but we can give advice how and where to get the training and equipment you need.\u00a0 Once proficient at basic skills, we can all learn further from each other, sharing tips and ideas on advanced skills, techniques, and styles.\u00a0 The Boston climbing community, including this Meetup group, has cool people from many different backgrounds, and from around the globe, so you can also learn a lot about the world while sharing your passion for the vertical domain!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : x-small\">Seasoned climbers know it well, but to those who are new: Keep it fun by climbing smart and safe. Climbing is inherently dangerous, and any bad fall (rock, ice, or human) can result in serious injury or death. Proper training and good common sense are important to minimize risks. Your participation in any climbing activity (and any activity with this Meetup group) is AT YOUR OWN RISK. Ward Smith summed it up nicely: \"If you do get hurt, don't even think about blaming someone else. You made the decision to walk up to the cliff and get on a particular route . . . instead of staying home, watching football, and eating cheese doodles like the rest of the 'free' world. Have fun, but climb safely, and take responsibility for your own actions.\"<\/span><\/p>",

Our hope is to create more community for gay\/queer women in the Boston Area, especially for women who have recently moved here, or who have recently come out. Also, to help change the story that it is so hard to meet people in Boston. We are an inclusive group for women of all ages and backgrounds who identify as gay or queer in any way, including\u00a0transgender individuals who identify as\u00a0women. Please respect our desire to maintain a \"women's space\" if you\u00a0do not\u00a0claim a woman's identity.\u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n One of the organizers tries to be at as many of the events as possible to help welcome everyone. Many women come to these events on their own, but we're available to meet up with anyone interested before an event so you don't have to go on your own. Feel free to contact one of us by email, or call Robin at 617-331-4116.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n The more events we have the better, so please send any ideas you have for exciting events by email to the organizers. Please understand that we'll typically need at least a week's notice to post an event. If you have a last minute idea, you can always post it to the Message Board.<\/p>\n<p>You can also send a message to the group if your are looking for resources or referrals. We are great resources to one another.<\/p>",

Just make sure to check the calendar first , as the location may change<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : small\">This is an ongoing thing unless otherwise noted, so be sure to check the calendar weekly and PLEASE, rsvp so we'll be sure to have a seat for you!\u00a0\u00a0 We're usually in the back of the restaurant in the large banquette.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : small\">We ask that you NOT bring in drinks and food from other places and\/or home.\u00a0 Panera is very generous with the space and time they give to us and we want to support and give back to them.\u00a0 Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : small\">The original Meet Up group started with about 10 - 12 people who met at Panera in Stoughton\u00a0 and were from Dedham, Framingham, Canton, Stoughton, Sharon and\u00a0Brockton. Since that time our membership has spread to Brookline, Newton, Needham, West Roxbury, but based on popular demand, we want to make it convenient for people who live in the city, Metrowest, and north\u00a0to join us as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : small\">Some of us are divorced, others widowed and some single...and we all have the same desire to expand our social life...meet new people, make new friends, and be busy with all that life has to offer us here in Greater Boston. That's why we've grown so much in just 4 years and made incredible friendships!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : small\">Whether religious, observant, or not observant at all, we also share a common heritage that brings us close. Being 55+ means we have lots of shared experiences and special memories too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : small\">Keep in mind that we are not a \u2018dating site\u2019, but if you do meet someone special (and several of our members have) we\u2019ll celebrate right along with you!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : small\">We are a dues paying group - $12.00 annually every January, or prorated @ $1.00\/month if you join during the year. Once your membership is approved by having answered the five questions, we ask that you come to Panera within the next 30 days to meet us and determine if you wish to become a dues paying member. If we do no see or hear from you in 30 days we'll assume you've decided otherwise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : medium\">We hope to see you very soon!<br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>",

We gather to share a unique perspective that belongs to people of Asian descent and to celebrate our diversity as well.

By joining our group we presume you are struggling with SA in some way, we are a peer only group and do not have any therapists, clinicians as members, .&nbsp; SA affects people regardless of race, religion, gender, age, or sexual orientation. We are an inclusive group and welcome all who have SA. Most importantly, this group is about community. We all have something in common. We always strive to provide a welcoming envirnment. There are two types of activities that we organize: Discussion meetups and Social Activity events. At the discussion meetups , we gather and discuss SA-relevant topics, strategies, and experiences. For the activity events, we venture out into that imposing social world in the form of various fun activities, with the support of our environment at our meetings\/events to help people feel more at ease. Participation at an event or meeting is always voluntary. Past events have included ethnic dining, walks, movies, game nights, brunches, museum visits, and hiking. <span>Please note that any member with frequent no-shows or a last-minute cancellations is subject to being changed from the yes list to the waitlist at any event that has a waiting list.&nbsp;<\/span>Boston Area Social Anxiety Organizers are not responsible for the well being of any person \/member while attending an event. Every member must use their own best judgement and common sense and are wholly responsible for themselves. By joining the Boston Area Social Anxiety group each member agrees to these rules. Once you join please check out our activity calendar and message board too. Feel free to participate in anything we do! We try to have fun\/interesting activities to do despite our SA.

If you're looking for a fun group of all ages, genders and cultures... , By membership vote we do not allow trikes or CAN\u00a0<span>AMs'.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>BAMR has lots of planned rides on the calendar and plenty of pickup rides, in addition off season events... a group open to both recent and seasoned riders... then perhaps BAMR is the riding group for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>BAMR gets around Take a look at our calendar and you'll see we average over 60 rides a year! From your backyard to Caribou ME, Quebec and Tail of Dragon<\/p>\n<p>BAMR emphasizes safety. We schedule rides for all experience levels and we are the only group (that we know of) conducting monthly rides specifically for those who have never ridden in a group. We want our members to feel relaxed and safe and discourage any stunts or \"trick\" riding. As much as we love to avoid highways, some rides require us to use them. If your bike is not \"highway compatible\" you may want to skip any ride that's noted as such.<\/p>\n<p>BAMR is not a club (no meetings, no elections) The dues help to cover fees that meetup.com charges. The group is run by volunteers and you are welcome to help out or simply come along for the rides.<\/p>\n<p>THIS IS NOT A DATING SITE, it is purely for owners of bikes who like to ride<\/p>\n<p>DISCLAIMER: By joining this group I acknowledge that motorcycle related activities are dangerous and that accidents causing death, bodily injury, disability and property damage, can, and do happen. I acknowledge that I have motorcycle insurance coverage as required by Massachusetts state laws. I acknowledge that I am responsible for my own actions and behaviors while riding a motorcycle within the group.<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: We do have a few message areas open to the public Click on \"Discussions\" above and message board to see them. This is a bug with meetup.com<\/p>",

Words can't summarize my experience. Absolutely wonderful people with a great sense of humor. Time just flew by. Thanks, Rob for organizing this event and WE ( I take the liberty of every one that attended here) truly appreciate your time &amp; thoughtfulness. Simply put it we had a BLAST; Thank you again and look forward few more meet ups before the season ends. \u201d<\/p>\n<p>Karan: 2009 Nantucket Trip Participant<\/p>\n<p>Organizer Rob Fox writes: \"I've participated in so many other biking\/fitness groups over the years where it seems like the main goal is to just get to the finish first. In our group, we are not only out to get a good fitness ride in (average pace 12-15 mph) but I like for people to leave our rides feeling like they just made a bunch of great new friends! Join us! We're a fun group and we love cycling!!\"<\/p>\n<p>If you join us, please bring your sense of humor and desire for adventure because, yes it's true, we even get lost sometimes :-) as we explore new routes together? It keeps things exciting!<\/p>\n<p>We usually wrap up the ride with a bite to eat or an ice cream somewhere in the vicinity of the ride's end point.<\/p>\n<p>Feel free at anytime to write me with any questions that you have!<\/p>\n<p>Rob Fox, Organizer<br>\n\nrobfox@verizon.net<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>We are a group of friends with similar interests - the primary one being hiking. It doesn't matter if it's a one-day trip or a multi-day backpack; we like climbing up and down the tallest mountains throughout the Northeast (and beyond). Having other people come along with us makes things even more fun. Other activities on our calendar include biking (rail trail, road, &amp; off-road), kayaking (rivers, lakes, &amp; ocean), skiing (downhill &amp; cross country), and various adventure races.<\/p>\n<p>Our approach is simple - the strength of a cohesive group is greater than the sum of its individual parts.\u00a0We start as a group, stay as a group, and finish as a group. Our pace will be that of the slowest hiker. We travel in small groups (10-15 people) to lessen our impact on the environment and the others who are also out there enjoying the peace and solitude of the outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>Here some glimpses of what we do...<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/hiking-305\/photos\/\"><strong>Random Pictures of Random Events<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/hiking-305\/pages\/Random_Videos_of_Random_Events\/\">Random Videos of Random Events<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Most of our hikes involve climbing to the highest summits in the Northeast. That means people have to get up early, drive a long distance, and then spend most of the day hiking. There aren\u2019t many late starts, short day, or easy\/moderate level hikes on our calendar. Instead of trying to do something that another group has already perfected, we have partnered with the\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Blue-Hills-Hiking\">Blue Hills Hiking Club<\/a><\/strong> out of Boston, MA to offer hikes to the members of the other group.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t let their name fool you \u2013 while they spend a lot of time hiking in the Blue Hills they will also be planning trips to explore some of the other great places close to Boston. Don\u2019t let the Blue Hills themselves fool you either \u2013 you can put together a route that includes similar distance (~10-14 miles) and elevation gain (~2,600 feet) to what you might find three hours away in the White Mountains.<\/p>\n<p>If this sounds like fun then be sure to join our group and sign-up for an event.<\/p>",

The group originally ran with two branches: Cambridge and Brookline, and our goal is to provide similar groupings in and around the Boston area.  Organization has changed hands over the past two years, but the result has always been a source of good conversation, new acquaintances, and exposure to books and genres that provide both comfort and exploration.  \r\n\r\nSo, if you're into reading, talking, and often eating (yay, eating!), you are even remotely close to the Boston area, and are the ages of 20-30ish, this is the group for you.",

My goal is for this group to be the place where you can meet-up with other like-minded and go to the diverse and eclectic international live music scene happening in all of New England! This group is not more mine than yours. Anyone can organize a meet-up just email me and I'll have you as an assistant organizer or change a posted event to be a meet-up. I try to keep the calendar up to date but please keep me informed if you know about an event that I missed. I am a musician and I have a passion for traditional and contemporary North-African music. I also love all traditional dances and acoustic Indian and African music as well as salsa, samba, jazz...Anything that moves me! What is the music that moves and touches you?<\/p>\n<p>Joining the group, policies, etc..<\/p>\n<p>After a new member come to a meet-up, if he or she decide to stick with the group they will have to participate a mandatory $5 once a year contribution.<\/p>\n<p>This is to help me pay for the site maintenance fees. You can always look at the group finances by going and clicking on the \"tools\" tag and then to the \"money\".<\/p>\n<p>If you RSVP to an event but don't show up - without taking the time to let the event organizer know - there is a good chance that you will be expelled from the group. <span>Please understand that, event organizers are not paid (no one is) but\u00a0take some of their valuable time and sometime put quite a lot of effort to organize a meet-up. You have to let them know if you cannot make it at the last minute, it's only fair and polite.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n That's about it! I hope that does not sound too harsh...really we are a bunch of nice and gentle music lovers people!<\/p>\n<p>See you at a show!<\/p>\n<p>Jacques Pardo<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/p>",

The moderator posts weekly where we are to meet and when. Typical plein air sites include fields, historic sites, lakes, ocean, saltmarsh, rivers, and hills, all accessible easily. All media (drawing, photography, pastels, oils, watercolor, etc.) are welcome as are all skill levels. Group size will be limited so to keep the outings informal, manageable, and friendly. Family members are welcome, although specific quiet rules apply. The culture of the group is supportive and non-critical. Membership is free and artists are under no obligation to attend outings.<\/p>",

Meet up for food or drinks before and after shows.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nVenues that will be the most frequented:<br>\n\n<br>\n\nMiddle East &ndash; Cambridge<br>\n\nBrighton Music Hall &ndash; Brighton<br>\n\nGreat Scott &ndash; Allston<br>\n\nParadise Rock Club (and Lounge) - Boston (near BU)<br>\n\nRoyale &ndash; Boston<br>\n\nTT the Bears - Cambridge<br>\n\n<br>\n\nThis group will be an open forum for indie (and the like) shows. Rather than stick to the standard Meetup model of having a few organizers run all the events, we&rsquo;d like to get everyone involved and have lots of options on the calendar. So if you&rsquo;re planning on heading to a show, and you&rsquo;re willing to be responsible for arranging a time and place to meet and making sure people can find you and the group when they arrive, send us a suggestion (use the big &ldquo;Schedule a New Meetup&rdquo; link on our page) and we&rsquo;ll help you do the rest!<\/p>",

We plan surfing events when possible, but many of our events will be of the social nature including beach clean ups, surfrider fundraiser events, after work cocktail hours, and other events that members show an interest in.Through these social events, we can get to know one another, and when there is surf it will be much easier to find someone to hit the beach with.<\/p>\n<p>This group is made up of, and for, its members. Have an idea for an event or looking for someone to go surf with? Please feel welcome to post it as a suggested meetup or to our discussion Board. I am sure you will find many people who would love to join you!<\/p>\n<p>If you are not interested in participating in these other, more social events, you are still very welcome in the group, just be sure to adjust your account settings accordingly - to receive emails daily, weekly, or not at all if you would not like to hear about the events unless you visit the page.<\/p>\n<p>I look forward to meeting you and seeing you at an upcoming event!<\/p>",

A large number of us live in the Framingham, Hopkinton, Ashland and Southborough areas.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>Training:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Our open water trainings take place primarily in the Ashland Reservoir, on Mon, Wed and Fri mornings. Distances range&nbsp;from \u00bd mi to 2 mi or more, depending on who\u2019s up for what. We also coordinate run and bike training at other times during the week, including early morning track workouts and the 11.3 mi Pat Bell Time Trial on Tue evenings at 6:30p, leaving from the Southborough Library. You can learn more about the Pat Bell TT on Facebook.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Membership Dues:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Our annual membership fee is currently $25. The link to pay dues is: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bikereg.com\/27665\">https:\/\/www.bikereg.com\/27665<\/a>.<span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Most years we offer our members club-logo'd shwag (a hat, hoodie, bike shirt, etc.) This year we\u2019re designing a windbreaker. The club will subsidize about 50% and members will pitch in about $20, so that we break even.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Team Races:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This year we have designated the Ashland Lions Olympic Tri on June 21, the Mass State Championships Olympic Tri on July 12 and Cranberry Trifest on Aug 23rd as team races. We will have the Landry's Bike 12'x12' canopy at these races for members and their guests to congregate under. Members will be at many other races throughout the season, including sprints, Olympics, \u00bd irons, and ironman races (2 at Mont Tremblant and 1 at Lake Placid), as well as at road (running) races and certain biking events such as reach the beach and the Harpoon brewer ride. Although we did not do so this year, we typically enter one or two teams at TriMania in the beginning of the season (at MIT), and regardless of whether we do this, many of us attended TriMania.&nbsp;<br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Social:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We have pre-season and post-season BBQs, and we have been known to meet for a drink on a random week night as well. We also tend to&nbsp;<\/span><span>share a good deal of information on training, nutrition, race expectations, fitness, recovery, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Other:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Some members are also into Cyclocross, Aquabike, and trail running. Also, we get discounts at Landry\u2019s and other sponsors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Off-Season:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We have begun to make arrangements with Landry\u2019s to host off-season bike training in the stores, open only to Tri club members where we\u2019ll bring our own bikes and hook them up to trainers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Feel free to message me if you wish to learn more.&nbsp;<\/span><span>Happy training and racing!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Craig Slater<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>President, LTC<\/span><\/p>",

That's my term for people of african heritage (i.e., african, african-american, afro-caribbean, afro-latino, afro-european) who love to spread their wings and travel to unusual, unexpected and interesting places. The Onyxbird also thrives on cultural exploration and tends to be socially conscious. Unfortunately, Onyxbirds tend to fly solo or as a pair. Very rarely are \"flocks\" of Onyxbirds spotted in China or Argentina or Finland or New Zealand.<\/p>\n<p>The purpose of this group is to form a Boston flock of Onyxbirds. We&nbsp;share travel tales, photos, food, music, recommendations, horror stories and more from our travels. We even schedule some \"migrations\"!!<\/p>\n<p>Please note that this group is not meant to be exclusionary. It is simply meant as a way to encourage people from the african diaspora to travel together and experience destinations other than the usual ones (e.g., Caribbean islands, Cancun, USA, etc.). We will always welcome birds from other flocks into the nest with open wings.<\/p>\n<p>Come get blown away by travel with the ONYXBIRDS!<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"embedded\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=W-RABR4FCAc\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=W-RABR4FCAc<\/a><\/p>",

Many of you have enough greenspace around your homes to make an impact. \u00a0There are also many who haven't got much more than a couple windowboxes or a single tree beside your apartment. \u00a0Yet, you shouldn't feel limited to your immediate surroundings; there are opportunities to volunteer in your neighborhood's public parks\/public spaces, or chances to guerrilla garden in vacant\u00a0lots.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Many of you are interested in ethnobotany--medicinal plants, foraging wild edibles, etc. \u00a0While that hasn't been the central focus of this group, it is certainly a welcome supplement, and engages people in their natural world in a way that helps them best identify with the experience of wildlife: gathering and using plants for survival. \u00a0We neglect our environment when we fail to recognize this common interest and the value it provides.<\/p>\n<p><span>All suburban properties are landscaped to some extent; owners recognize the improved appearance and property value. \u00a0Yet, the plants chosen are too often non-native, invasive, produce sterile blossoms, inedible fruit, often situated in monocultures, and are a limited selection of tedious repetition (on average, the same 40 plants--in various arrangements--comprise 90% of our suburban landscapes). \u00a0Some of the problem lies with limited availability from nurseries and garden centers; the rest with uninformed consumers. \u00a0So let's get informed. \u00a0With a little insight, plants offering beauty and greater wildlife benefit can be substituted.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n ps. \u00a0<br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We love dogs, but many of our members prefer not to walk with them during our nature hikes--they can <span>sometimes<\/span> be a distraction when we are trying to observe wildlife.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/c\/b\/0\/event_3464208.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left\"><\/p>\n<p><span><br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>The Vocal Revolution at vocalrevolution.org (formerly Sounds of Concord) is one of New England's top performing men's a cappella choruses that loves to perform for the love of music. Chartered in the Barbershop Harmony Society (BHS), Vocal Revolution (VR for short) has been entertaining audiences for over 40 years, most recently as one of New England's top-ranked male vocal ensembles, specifically the 2012 Northeastern District (NED) Chorus Champion of the BHS. Our singing is primarily in the barbershop style: four-part close harmony with rich emotional melodies designed to captivate our audiences. Our current repertoire includes gorgeous ballads, toe-tapping swing songs, and vivacious up-tunes geared at energizing our listeners. While we specialize in traditional barbershop tunes, we enjoy all forms of a cappella music from stage and screen, spirituals, folk tunes, and patriotic songs.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n The singers of Vocal Revolution come from all walks of life, joining together to share the<br>\n\n joy of singing and fellowship. From the risers, you'll find lawyers, software programmers,<br>\n\n students, salesmen, handymen, retired men, and the list goes on. We join together to create music that has the ability to affect people's lives, if only for a moment.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Our philosophy is that if you want to do something, it's worth doing at the best of your ability!<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Our culture consists of a diverse group of guys who bond together by one fervent passion: we love to sing and we believe that changing lives through music is worth the hard work and determination asked of us in Vocal Revolution. We work hard individually outside of rehearsal to learn the notes and words to our songs, so that rehearsal time can be spent molding our individual abilities into a holistic art form. Our consistent goal is to better ourselves, as well as the chorus, as we work together to make our sound a true item of beauty. We hope you will love the VR culture of warmth and encouragement; each member has his own unique qualities and we love that! We are thrilled to have you experience it for yourself.<\/p>",

Usually around 10 people, the group size fluctuates between 5 and 18 each week.\u00a0 Once people (like you!) find us on Meetups they don't usually register through this website each week - so you may not see a lot of activity on these pages even though the group is very active.<\/p>\n<p>Good company, good snacks, good vibes, good meditation, good life! Visit www.sacredspaces.ws for more info and other events happening weekly and monthly here at Sacred Spaces. Related topics include:\u00a0 meditation, retreat, inner peace, present moment, living in the now, spirituality, consciousness, awareness, spiritual community, friends, The Power of Now, A New Earth, and so on.\u00a0 You get the picture!\u00a0 I do look forward to meeting you here.\u00a0 Peace,\u00a0 Judy<\/p>",

This group is also open to non-single parents who appreciate & support our situation (relatives, mentors, teachers, adult children of single moms, babysitters, etc.).\r\nThis meetup is unique from most because it is a chance for families to not only get together at least once a month, but to really be a supportive resource to single mothers.  If your sitter bailed at the last minute, you would call another mother within our community to help you out & she, in return, could count on you to reciprocate, without $$$.  Or if you are without a vehicle, but need to go food shopping, another mom would be able to support you as well.\r\nThis group is definitely lots of fun.  We have Moms' Nite Out\/In, cool outings with the kids, pampering days, themed playdates & so much more!  I have enrolled business associates, qualified sitters & male mentors, just to name a few, who have offered their support as well.\r\nYou will have love, support, a voice that will be heard and friendships that will last a lifetime!",

Boston By Foot is a non-profit organization that promotes the architecture and history of Boston and has been offering guided walking tours of Boston since 1976. Our meetup group is made up of Boston By Foot volunteers, Boston explorers, history buffs, and architecture aficionados who like the \"off the beaten trail\" walking tours offered by Boston By Foot. Learn more about Boston By Foot at www.bostonbyfoot.org.  Boston By Foot charges a price for their tours to keep the organization going but once in a while we get a freebie. A \"card holder\" price is also posted which applies to card-carrying Boston By Foot members. Joining this meetup group doesn't make you a Boston By Foot member, you need to do that through the Boston By Foot web site. The membership fees for an individual are about $50 per year (less if you are a student) . If you plan on attending more than a few, the membership is worth it. You can also arrange to sample one and apply your ticket fee to a membership following a tour.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>\"Sex And the City\", \"Friends\", \"Seinfeld\"-- Something fundamental about these shows made them cult like hits. I think it recognizes a reality that young 20s, 30 somethings desire-- a good network of reliable friends. Ever get a flat tire, need a ride to the airport, and wonder which buddy you can call. And overall, what maeks this group different is that sometimes we don't want to go hiking- we just want to go out the house, go for coffee, the movies, or shopping with a bud to have someone tell us how we look at that shirt.<\/p>\r\n<p>I believe the diversity of interests of friends can make it fun. So this is the Seinfeld of Meetup groups, about nothing, ...about everything. The meet-ups will be laid back and I will make sure people get introduced. I was an RA in college so maybe I'm good at that.<\/p>",

I want to share with others the joy and gift of meditation and connection with God. Personally, daily meditation continues to help me to be centered in my life. I have been meditating for many years using different techniques. My path through yoga and contemplative Hinduism brought me to mystical Christianity.\u00a0<br>\n\nI will offer\u00a0meet ups, classes, events\u00a0and seminars that will focus on experiencing inner peace, stillness of mind, learning how to connect with God inside. Meditation is a tool to learn more about ourselves and others, and to have a deeper relationship with the Great Source of love, God\u00a0(or what ever name you want to call It.) Practice is the key, It is totally doable even for the most unruly mind!<\/p>",

CEOs and executives at top companies, including Google, Salesforce and Tupperware, state in recent magazine articles that meditation restores balance in their lives, improves sleep and<\/span> provides them with a competitive edge.<\/p>\n<p>Boston Meditates is supported by The Art of Living Foundation.

Our members come from towns all over MetroWest, including (but not limited to) Framingham, Natick, Ashland, Hopkinton, Southboro, Sudbury, Wayland, and Wellesley. Our children range in age from newborns to teenagers, and we have a good mix of members who are caring for children full time, working full-time for pay, and everywhere in between. <br> <br>In addition to this large network of mothers, we offer a wide range of activities including monthly discussion meetings, moms\u2019 nights out, children's activities, a book group, community service projects, playgroups, and much more. There is something for everyone!<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Mothers &amp; More: <br><\/strong>Mothers &amp; More is a national non-profit organization dedicated to improving the lives of mothers through support, education and advocacy. We address mothers\u2019 needs as individuals and members of society, and promote the value of all the work mothers do. Our mission is based on the following core beliefs:<\/p>\n<ul> \n <p>A mother is more than any single role she plays at any given point in her lifetime. She is entitled to fully explore and develop her identity as she chooses: as a woman, a citizen, a parent or an employee. <br> <br><\/p> \n <p>All the work mothers do \u2013 whether paid or unpaid - has social and economic value. <br> <br><\/p> \n <p>All women deserve recognition and support for their right to choose if and how to combine parenting and paid employment. <br> <br><\/p> \n <p>All mothers, all children and all families are unique. We respect the wisdom of each mother to decide how to care for her children, her family and herself. <br> <br><\/p> \n <p>Mothers have the right to fulfill their caregiving responsibilities without incurring social and economic penalties. <br> <br><\/p> \n <p>The transitions women make into and through motherhood are challenging and can be difficult. <br> <br><\/p> \n <p>Together, mothers are powerful.<\/p> \n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n  Check out our local site for even more information and consider coming to our next scheduled meetup! \n <a href=\"http:\/\/www.metrowestmothersandmore.org\"><\/a> \n <a href=\"http:\/\/www.metrowestmothersandmore.org\">http:\/\/www.metrowestmothersandmore.org<\/a> \n<\/ul>",

It's a great group for practicing having real conversations in ASL.<\/p>\n<p>We welcome ANYONE with an interest in ASL and Deaf culture.<\/p>\n<p>We are a bunch of people who love ASL and Deaf culture, and who want to get better and better at signing. Some of us want to become interpreters or are in interpreting programs. Others work with Deaf people or have Deaf family members. We have beginner ASL students, pros, and everything in between. Some of us are Deaf and just want to hang out with other fun Deaf, hard-of-hearing, or hearing people who sign. Essentially, we are a social group brought together because we love ASL and we want to have a place where we can socialize, get to know one another, and practice our ASL skills.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">Boston ASL welcomes and celebrates diversity in our membership!

        "description": "<p>Good Day, A group organizer for Artists + Artisans has stepped down and I've volunteered to take the reins. I'm a first-time Meetup Organizer, so we'll have to learn as we go. Number one, this group is for anyone who likes to make something out of anything, make something from nothing, make art from trash and turn trash to treasure. If your project is portable, then bring it. What projects could people possibly have? Sewing, painting, sketching, crocheting, knitting, pottery, paper making, carving, metal working, jewelry making and book binding just came to mind. With winter weather coming, wouldn't be cool to meet somewhere and work on our projects while it snows outside? The scheduled Meetups are still a go as planned, if you want to attend! . If you have ideas about what to do and where to go, please speak up. I'm looking into other venues, where we could possibly meet to work and our stuff would be safe from food crumbs and coffee stains. Public libraries have meeting rooms where we could talk above a whisper, right? In conclusion, I'm Melissa and the Coast Guard just transferred me to Boston a few months ago. I live in South End and love to walk, bike and take the T anywhere. I'll use a Zipcar when I have to. Currently, I'm dedicated to sewing quilt blocks from fabric scraps. I can knit, but need to practice more. I want to learn crochet, tatting, and how to make clothes. I love drawing, but am still stuck in the beginner stages. If you teach me to draw, I'll teach you to sew, deal? Ideas? See you there, Melissa<\/p>",

Through my own experience in singledom that past few years I've learned that both hosting and attending singles events can be an exercise in frustration and disappointment.<\/p>\n<p>I have since learned what I've known all along. the best way to meet someone and develop a healthy relationship is to get to know them the old fashioned way. You hang out with them for a little while, become friends and take it from there. So without drabbing on about the perils of dating in the new millennium, I just wanted to let you know that I am changing the focus of the group to mimic what I have been doing on the South Shore for a few years.<\/p>\n<p>You see the new name above. The focus will be on hosting varied events in the Boston Metro area and beyond, with the sole purpose of having fun and making friends. You don't have to be single to be a member of the group but most of us will be and if romance happens then it's a bonus !<\/p>\n<p>But let me be clear, this is not a dating site and I ask everyone to please be respectful and polite of the other members.<\/p>\n<p>I am always looking for help hosting events and Ideas so please don't be shy. This is just as much your group as it is mine. So let's have some fun.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>",

We are always interested in meeting new people.<\/p>\n<p>We are part of the Eastern Interclub Ski League with over 1000 members throughout the Mount Washington Valley. We participate in skiing and snowboarding in the winter, hiking in the White Mountains in the spring and fall and we organize a summer tubing trip on the Saco River every summer.<\/p>\n<p>The Brettl-Hupfers maintain a lodge that sleeps over 50 people in Bartlett, NH within minutes of several ski areas. We also organize events throughout the winter and during the rest of the year with our members, guests and friends. This meetup group is a way to stay in touch and participate in the events we\u2019ll organize throughout the season. If you\u2019re over 21, come on up as a guest to one of our events.<\/p>\n<p>*Members of the meetup are not necessarily members of the Brettl-Hupfers. \u00a0Please email any of the organizers to find out about club membership.*<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>21 plus only; no pets.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>",

That wedding, party, business event, or trip to Asia is coming up and you need to get up there and sing one. But you say, \u201cMy voice stinks! I can\u2019t sing! I can\u2019t get up in front of a group and do that!\u201d In Nigeria they say, \u201cIf you can talk, you can sing.\u201d Karaoke is not about being Sinatra, Streisand, Springsteen, or Stefani. Karaoke is about letting go and enjoying expressing yourself. Karaoke-Do\u2122 (\u201c\u2018empty orchestra\u2019-Way\u201d) is a path to enlightenment and growth, with no complicated body positions. Join Founding Grand Master Shihan Scott A. for the practice and insight (inspired by Carolyn Sloan's \"Finding Your Voice\") that will get you to take the mike. We aspire to the values of metta (fellowship) and mudita (joy in another's success). Have fun as you: \u2022 Learn to use your breath the right way. \u2022 Find, exercise, and use your voice. Yes, even yours. \u2022 Pick a song to sing. \u2022 Become one with the music and the applause! The only pre-requisite is a desire to sing. Every session is the \u201cfirst session\u201d. We meet in a private karaoke room, so your first performances are in front of a small, like-minded group. About Founding Grand Master Shihan Scott A.: \u2022 Master of Education from Harvard (and he has the ring to prove it.) \u2022 Sang 8 years with a prominent Boston chorus. \u2022 Appeared with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra under Zubin Mehta. \u2022 Sang with opera legends Robert Merrill and Jan Peerce, and rock pianist Jef Labes (\"Moondance\"). \u2022 Spiritual leader. \u2022 Ordained Minister, Church of Spiritual Humanism. \u2022 Student of karate-do, tai chi chu\u2019an, and Kabbalah. \u2022 Karaoke devotee since 1993. \u2022 Has sung karaoke from California to Kuala Lumpur (traveling east). \u2022 Taught computer consciousness as a software trainer. \u2022 Non-judgmental, supportive, encouraging.

They said it couldn't be done. Create a way to organize and empowers thousands of caring people to help fellow Bostonians in need? And do it in a no-hassle, no commitment way where folks can easily choose where and how they want to help?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">When we started the Boston Volunteers, we bucked all the trends. No mandatory training sessions for new people. No large corporate structures or high costs. Simply a bunch of good-natured and hard working people wanting to make our little corner of the world a better place. Why?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">Because we believe in better.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">With nothing more than word-of-mouth reputation, Meetup.com as a springboard, and a knack for gathering some of the coolest people around, the Boston Volunteers have experienced exponential and geometric growth. Who would have imagined that in three years we'd have more than forty seven hundred good-hearted Boston Volunteers standing up and fighting for better? Not us, for sure!\u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n While we are so incredibly grateful for all the volunteers who are already part of our community, there are still countless people in our neighbourhood who find themselves in need. That's why we need you. All you need is a caring heart and a willingness to share a little bit of your valuable time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">Join us and spend an evening in a Boston soup kitchen; help tutor a single, local mom so she can earn her GED; rebuild your neighborhood playground so kids can play safely; kayak and clean the Charles to better our environment; build a home for a local family; spend time with the elderly. The variety is endless and refreshing. You choose where and when. There will be a convenient volunteer celebration for you. Don't miss this easy opportunity to build community.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">While the Boston Volunteers have a well-earned reputation for having hard working and dependable folks, we're also known to have a pretty good time doing so. Beyound having fun while helping others, we also celebrate a variety of social events in your neighbourhood where we simply spend a little time relaxing and getting to know each other.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">Volunteer enough and you will make some meaningful and lasting friendships with some truly great people. I've build a growing and meaningful community. We often see each other at community volunteer events and frequently go to museums together. Please know that since day one, we have been an open and inclusive nonprofit community, where every volunteer- regardless of superficial differences is valued, respected and needed. Not only can you choose where and when you would like to volunteer, but also you are encouraged to bring new ideas and new volunteer opportunities to our attention. And if you have a passion and there's a need, we'll get you set up to lead your own volunteer event. We revere the can-do spirit.\u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Can you think of how we can better help people? Please share.<br>\n\n We are determinedly pursuing perfection.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">Are you ready to partner with a community our like-minded folks as we help our neighbors in need? Set-out to make our city a better place for us all?<br>\n\n Learn more about our popular nonprofit, take a peek at upcoming celebrations, sign up when there's a space, and start making a difference! If you ever have questions, feel free to email any of the assistant organizers. We are here for you.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Welcome to THE BOSTON VOLUNTEER FAMILY!

Most of our members live in the greater Boston area and get together either there or visit the lodge during the winter to have fun and enjoy winter sports, such as skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing and snowmobiling. We also have ski and snowboard racing and a variety of social events throughout the season with other clubs in the area. Please join our meetup so that we can keep you informed on upcoming events and get you involved with our club and have you meet our amazing members.<\/p>",

Gather to discuss Development, Standards, Networks, Marketing, Promotion and Business opportunities using AWS. Open to anyone interested in learning more about Amazon Web Services!<br><span><br><strong>And now for some details...<\/strong><\/span><\/p> \n<p><strong>Upcoming Scheduled Meetups:<\/strong><span> In general we meet on once a month, from 6:30-9pm, with 6:30-7pm for networking and food. <\/span><\/p> \n<p><strong>Attendance:<\/strong><span> We usually have in attendance approx. 30-60+ depending on location and topic - and we normally hold these Meetups in the Boston area - however, we are branching out to other areas\/facilities. Our attendees are generally in the middle ground between novice and expert, with many in the dev\/ops space. <br><\/span><\/p> \n<p><strong>Presentations:<\/strong><span> If you wish to present, contact the moderator at awsmeetup@extrmereach.com. Suggest a topic and an upcoming meeting(s) you would be available to present, then provide an abstract of the presentation (title and descriptive info) and a bit about the presenter (brief bio, just a few words). We generally have 2-3 presentations\/presenters per Meetup without repetition from recent past meetups - there is flexibility here. Also, our attendees are looking for technical depth and NOT a sales pitch - so please keep this in mind when proposing and creating your presentation. It\u2019s important that speakers speak loud and clear, in the event a PA system is not available. Also, when questions are asked, the presenter should repeat the question so that all can hear and understand the context of the answer. <\/span><\/p> \n<p><strong>Presentation - Slides: <\/strong><span>Usually there are requests for slides after a presentation. Your best bet is to post a link to slides as a comment to the applicable Meetup page. Any comments go to the entire group. <\/span><\/p> \n<p><strong>Sponsorship: <\/strong><span>A sponsor has their logo posted on our Meetup site with promotional statements, and is provided time during the Meetup to address attendees. Please see this link for examples: http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Boston-Amazon-Web-Services- Meetup-Group\/sponsors\/ <\/span><\/p> \n<p><strong>Sponsorship - Food\/Drink: <\/strong><span>We really appreciate our food sponsors and provide them extra time in self-promotion. Food and drink selection is up to the sponsor. Usually a mixed assortment of pizza and salad works well - but this is up to the sponsor. Pretty simple fare for this crowd - and usually no alcohol (but optional if the venue allows). Food is consumed as people arrive and mingle, and we usually get started with the presentations by 7pm. <\/span><\/p> \n<p><strong>Sponsorship - Location:<\/strong><span> We are open to a variety of locations. Minimum requirements include a facility that can host approx. 60 attendees, with projector and screen available. The only time we have needed amplification is when the meeting area has significant background noise (like certain climate control systems, or open environments where sound does not carry well). The facility should support groups who allow food and drink on premise. Please specify if alcohol is Not permitted, and\/or if there are drinks\/snacks or benefits that the facility supplies beyond the space hosting. Usually, attendance requires RSVP for security check-in (if required). The host location should post signage to make it very clear where attendees need to go for the meetup. Please supply any special instructions with regard to directions, parking, security check-in, etc. - these will be posted on the Meetup site. <\/span><\/p> \n<p><strong>Sponsorship - Other Items: <\/strong><span>There are other forms of sponsorship available, including supplying swag, offering door prizes for info cards being filled out, and covering the Meetup site hosting fees. Please reach out to the moderator for further details and arrangements. <\/span><\/p> \n<p><strong>Promotion of Other Events: <\/strong><span>We receive many requests to post outside events, functions, positions, and other items to the Meetup group. Members have provided direct feedback that they do Not want any sales presentations or unrelated solicitations. So, we keep it simple, stay focused on the purpose of this Meetup, and provide opportunities for companies to sponsor or present, and make announcements during the Meetup. In addition, comments can be posted to any of the scheduled Meetup pages on the Meetup site. These comments go out to the entire membership. <\/span><\/p> \n<p><strong>Attendee List: <\/strong><span>We are often asked about providing presenters and sponsors the attendee list. Unfortunately, most Meetup registrants use nicknames, and emails are not supplied to presenters\/sponsors. However, presenters\/sponsors can post to the Meetup site, commenting on the particular meeting page, which goes out to the entire group. In the comments you can indicate positive follow-up comments, offer slides, and drive response to another web link where more info can be gathered from attendees. <\/span><\/p> \n<p><strong>Reaching Mark Annati, the group moderator: <\/strong><span>Emails to Mark should contain the word \u2018meetup\u2019.

It's more of a \"networking laboratory.\"<\/p>\n<p>It is organized and hosted Diane Darling. I am an author, entrepreneur, blogger, columnist, speaker, and more.<\/p>\n<p>It's called \"Drinks Above Tiffanys\" because we started meeting at a restaurant literally above Tiffanys. We now meet at a variety of restauants. If you know of place that is interested in hosting us, please let me know - Diane@EffectiveNetworking.com.<\/p>\n<p>The spirit behind this group is for low-key, casual networking. Each month I share a few networking tips and we do an exercise where you introduce someone you've recently met.<\/p>\n<p>Why introduce someone you've met vs. yourself? GREAT question!<\/p>\n<p>You are just one person - you can only be in one place at a time. If you have \"ambassadors\" who can be your eyes and ears, then there are many others who can help you.<\/p>\n<p>It's pretty low-key so if you want to add something to the introduction yourself, that's fine too. It's a great way to learn what people hear you say ... or interpret what you say.<\/p>\n<p>We gather ~ 6:00 pm and have casual networking. Then we have a networking exercise. More details are available in the description.<\/p>\n<p>I look forward to seeing you and enjoy!<\/p>\n<p>Cheers ~ Diane Darling<\/p>",

Join us through series of ongoing events and workshops to learn pioneering systems and self-help tools based on Energy Psychology and Energy Medicine that have consistently led many all over the world to true recovery, from fear, anxiety and trauma, not just coping for the rest of one's life. And do it in a way that is fast, safe and lasting, by following universal principles and understanding structures of our bodies and the fact that we live in a state of energetic displacement and misalignment.<\/p>\r\n<p>Plato and most non-western traditions viewed anxiety and trauma not merely as something being &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; with a person, or an illness, but as a loss of balance between the psyche and body (soma), hence the origin of the term psychosomatic symptom.<\/p>\r\n<p>You may find what is going on with you particularly scary because no one can explain your symptoms, and you feel a loss of control.  But, from energy psychology, we learn that the disconnection of the psyche and the body happens in a particular order, according to certain rules and structures, which leads directly to the symptoms you experience.<\/p>\r\n<p>But it's not your fault that energetic misalignment is holding you back. There is nothing \"wrong\" with you or how you feel. Your fears are not irrational. Your symptoms are not un-explainable. When you reintegrate back as you heal your trauma, you become whole and you will find that all the symptoms disappear along with the anxiety and fears.  <br \/>(to learn more about structures and symptoms listen to a FREE interview with Victor Vinkus on <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.healingwithouteffort.com\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.healingwithouteffort.com\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.healingwithouteffort.com\" title=\"http:\/\/www.healingwithouteffort.com\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.healingwithouteffort.com<\/a><\/a>)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>We deserve to be comfortable in our body and with things around us. This meetup could be an invaluable support tool for all the work that you are doing in your life or other systems and tools you are already using.<\/p>\r\n<p>Learn the most effective self-help techniques for clearing worried mind, stopping persistent thoughts and most importantly, being comfortable in the body. It will work in cases of acute and chronic trauma, but it is an amazing tool in everyday life. Many unexplainable symptoms and pains that we have is a result particular displacement and misalignment of your energy as a result of trauma and stress.<\/p>\r\n<p>This meetup is for individuals who want to learn how to heal themselves (and others) from a wide range of emotional trauma that may hold you back in your life &ndash; fears, anxiety, depression, panic disorders, and fears\/phobias. (All types of emotional trauma will be covered depending on the needs of the group, including childhood emotional trauma, PTSD, abuse, rape, alcoholism and drug abuse)<\/p>\r\n<p>This meetup is not about just coping with these conditions, but about reversing them, even when other methods have failed.<\/p>\r\n<p>( Also please see the About page for more info)<\/p>\r\n<p>Do you dream, do you hope to be free one day from the grips of fears, panic, anxiety, depression, PTSD or any other emotional trauma? You've invested so much time and energy in getting to where you are now but, so often like the end of a rainbow, it moves away from you the closer you get to it.<\/p>\r\n<p>All that is about to change though!<\/p>\r\n<p>Come and join this group if you are looking for a friend <br \/>who is on your side, <br \/>who can meet you exactly where you are, <br \/>who can go with you to where you want to go, <br \/>who can offer some helpful advice and explanations <br \/>who knows that your stories are not baseless, and knows it better then you could ever imagine.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let us make this meetup 'the light at the end of the tunnel'! One last door that needs to be opened before you can step into a place of wholeness and freedom from all that holds you back. Come and join in us to heal together.<\/p>\r\n<p>We do not support strict dogma or belief systems. All the exercises are experiential and based on principles that are universally grounded in a wide range of spiritual traditions. An effective system has to make sense and produce tangible results.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Yuliya Cohen is an internationally known expert in the area of anxiety and trauma. Over the last 25 years, she have developed a pioneering system presented at the International Energy Psychology conference in USA and Canada.  She has enabled thousands of people to heal from most severe fears, anxiety and trauma in a way that is safe, lasting and with a sense of ease using her groundbreaking method for correcting energetic displacement. Formerly a computer scientist and an engineer, she is the founder of the Energy Restructuring Institute where she carries out research in the emerging fields of Energy Medicine and Energy Psychology.<\/p>\r\n<p>She is an author of a book \"<strong>Energetic Boundaries: The New Paradigm in Effortless Healing<\/strong>\" <br \/>and an upcoming paradigm shifting book \"<strong>The Four Gateways to Recovery - The Forgotten Path of Returning to Wholeness from Anxiety, Panic and PTSD<\/strong>\" <br \/> More info about Yuliya <strong>is at www.healingwithouteffort.com<\/strong><\/p>",

It is a place of beautiful parks and waterfront, great restaurants and late night cafes. We'll dine in, visit the summer feasts, the Taste of the North End event, wine tastings, a food tour and other special events. And for all of you night-owls like myself, there will be after-parties- at cafes, bars and even my place. So please join us for fun food events in Boston's \"Little Italy.\" And a diverse membership is much desired.\r\n\r\nJim",

Thanks! The Boston Tea Party was an act of direct protest by American Colonists demanding representation in the British Government. They became known as the original patriots. The New Boston Tea Party of 2009 and Tea Parties all across America will reinvigorate that American and Patriotic spirit; one that demands respect for individual rights and property. As the bailouts spiral out of control, we are forced to fund failed banks. With foreclosures on the rise, we are made the collateral of reckless spending. And, when the bills come due, the IRS knocks on the door of \u201cself-responsibility\u201d. ENOUGH! America is the land of opportunity. To succeed AND to Fail. Without consequences, what is our incentive to learn? What is our incentive to produce? On July 4, 2009, those that ask nothing from the government but the protection of our inalienable right to succeed, will gather in many cities across this great nation in an historic act of direct protest.<\/p>",

The Enneagram is an amazing tool to understand personality differences, to increase self-understanding and communicate to the world of each personality type and many unique subtypes.

(And, truth be told, I, the founder, have been accused of being \"polymorphously attracted,\" as one friend put it -- meaning, I like many different shapes and sizes of people.)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">For a few years, I studied feminism and queer theory very carefully, trying to figure out where my story fits, and in the process, I felt forced to identify with only the established categories (read: stereotypes) of women who like women. At some point, however -- and thankfully so -- I realized that none of them truly spoke to me \u2014 although many of them spoke to parts of me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">It took longer still for me to truly embrace my <em><strong>own<\/strong><\/em> vision of <em><strong>which<\/strong><\/em> women I like -- and to be okay with it. But, after many years of struggling with the dissonance between the established reality and my own reality, and once I had finally embraced my feminine self, I decided to form this group. <a href=\"http:\/\/lipsticklesbiansociety.blog.com\/2011\/02\/02\/our-story-on-exclusivity-and-how-we-came-to-be\/\">Read More....<\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size : large\">No one should feel restricted in finding fulfillment because they fear judgment from their community.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I'd like to thank all of you for the tremendous and continued support in fulfilling our dreams.

It could change today or tomorrow. (And that's why we love it.) Others of us are more moderate, a-okay with being feminine, and have no qualms about it!!<\/p>\n<p>We hope to create support, community, and a social outlet for all us poor LL's and femme girls starved for attractive, girly female company. :)<\/p>\n<p>** A note on this group being for 'very femme' girls: Our presentation as very feminine may or may not be our permanent style. We realize the trappings of heterosexism that sometimes force women into 'femmehood.' There will be members of this group who don't give a hoot about social theory on this topic, and that is their right. Other members will be aware of the implications and history of their gender presentation, but nonetheless (or in spite of it) will be happy to embrace their presentation as femmes. There will also be a range of members in between, and outside of, those two opinions. It should all make for interesting debate and discussion. We ask that you respect our right to associate, whatever your beliefs.<\/p>\n<p>** A further note on the use of the words 'lesbian' and 'bisexual:' Some of us, for example, aren't crazy about the gender binary created by the two poles of 'lesbian' and 'straight,' with the only in-between or both-encompassing category being 'bi.' We question gender as a concept, and see it as a social construct. This only begins to scratch the surface of why the words 'lesbian' or 'bi' may be insufficient descriptors for some (though not all!) of us, but we are simply using these popular terms for the sake of easy recognition by those seeking this type of community.<\/p>",

Whether you are a Meetup member or not, if you're over 40 and single (single couples also) you are invited to the party. \r\n\r\nI would like to know which area you'd like to see a North of 40 dance held. Marblehead is hard for many people to get to and not close to a major highway. Many of our members haven't attended a dance yet and I'd like to know where and what would get you to attend our dances. If you have attended a dance please let me know what you liked and didn't like. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email me.\r\n\r\nSincerely, Rick\r\n\r\nCheck out North of 40's Meetup affiliates:\r\nSINGLES DANCE DINNER PARTY- AGE 30-65\r\nHosted by Richard Tosti\/Burlington - http:\/\/www.dance.meetup.com\/393\r\n\r\nBOSTON-35-WINE-DINE-DANCE-AND-BE-MERRY\r\nHosted by Ms. Marianne\/Boston - http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BOSTON-35-WINE-DINE-DANCE-AND-BE-MERRY-MEET-UP\r\n\r\nJoshua 's Meet up Group - Pool, bowling, movies, travel and BEER!\r\nhttp:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pool-bowling-movies-travel-and-BEER",

We\u00a0help you see doors where you see only walls!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Our Holistic Lifestyle Club is a group of energetic women who are on their journey to a more fulfilling and abundant life. \u00a0We all have our dreams, small and big, and we all have some challenges, also small and big. But we are optimistic and persistent in following our own bliss. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We get together for interesting discussions and fun workshops. We believe in the power of the mind and holistic healing. We practice, teach and offer others Qi-Gong, yoga classes, Reiki, nutrition advice or deep breathing detox.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Our meetings evolve around body-brain-mind-spirit topics and usually end with a special healing tea time.<br>\n\n If you are a young lady who has many questions about life and is not sure where to start her journey, or a mid-age woman seeking her own authentic voice, or an older woman who is looking for a female group to support her late dreams, or to get into a better, healthier lifestyle, you are so welcome to our group!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Women are multi-tasking beings and like to see the details as well as the whole picture. They are programmed by Mother Nature to jump from one thing to another just to \"taste\"\/ to sense if that method, tool or direction is right for them. If you want to try a little bit of everything to move forward while searching for who you are, this meetup is for you. It will offer you these opportunities and maybe much more.<\/p>\n<p>I hope to see you soon in our group for learning and having good time!<\/p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Costs:<\/strong><\/span> <span><span><em>To join<\/em><\/span> the group is\u00a0<em><strong>FREE<\/strong><\/em>, but if you have enjoyed\u00a0at least two workshops during a year, please help to keep it going by making a <span><strong>$5.00<\/strong><\/span> annual donation to \u00a0cover the costs associated with running the website and pay<\/span> <span>the Meetup fees of $144\/year.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Attendance policy:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>1.

Check out the recipe or cooking advice section under the discussions section. Food is a\u00a0phenomena that brings people together and through that venue we can broaden our horizons,\u00a0meet new people and have fun. That's what it's all about.<\/p>",

You break a sweat, burn your quads a bit and then enjoy some food\/drinks, and in the process become friends.<\/p>\n<p><em>We will try to schedule our rides with a social element to follow. A 20 to 40 mile ride with a drink or two at a local pub - what could be better?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Nervous about your ability to keep up with the group? Look, we all come in different shapes and sizes and that goes for our bikes too. More often than not we'll have a 'sweeper' (someone who purposefully rides last to ensure that no one is left behind) on these rides. We also try to make route maps for everyone. But it's completely natural for the group to organically divide itself up depending on speed. Just know thyself and your own threshold :-)<\/p>\n<p>We just ask that you come with a good attitude and an open-mind.

I can\u2019t get up in front of a group and do that!\u201d In Nigeria they say, \u201cIf you can talk, you can sing.\u201d Singing in public -- is not about being Sinatra, Streisand, Springsteen, or Stefani. -- is not about \u201cgoing to Hollywood\/Vegas\/the next round\u201d so that you can be exploited or disappointed. Singing in public is about letting go and enjoying expressing yourself. SingFree Sessions\u2122 are a path to that growth that will push your envelope in a completely fun way. It is practice and insight on all levels (based on Carolyn Sloan's \"Finding Your Voice\") that encourage you to shatter the barriers to public self-presentation. We uphold the values of metta (fellowship) and mudita (joy in another's success). No contests! Have fun as you: \u2022 Learn to use your breath the right way. \u2022 Find, exercise, and use your voice. (Yes, even yours.) \u2022 Pick a song to sing. \u2022 Sing out and express yourself! There are no pre-requisites, except a desire to sing. Every session is the \u201cfirst session\u201d. About Scott: \u2022 Ed. M., Harvard Graduate School of Education. \u2022 Sang 8 years with a prominent Boston chorus, including performances with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. \u2022 Religious Leader, United Brothers Synagogue, Bristol, RI \u2022 Teacher of leaders of Jewish prayer \u2022 Ordained Minister, Church of Spiritual Humanism. \u2022 Student of karate-do, tai chi chu\u2019an, and Kabbalah. \u2022 Taught hundreds of new technology users as a software trainer. \u2022 Non-judgmental, supportive, and encouraging instructor and coach. Join the group, and you'll easily find out about upcoming public SingFree Sessions. You can also arrange SingFree Sessions for private groups and corporate events.

True to a Meetup format, we always have a presentation or learning session and a Q&amp;A which is preceded and followed by general networking opportunities with both experienced and relatively new professionals interested in the Internet and its use in successful marketing programs.&nbsp; We feel peer learning and networking with an educational component is the best way to get introduced to Internet Marketing as well as building your knowledge base and contacts for the experienced online marketer. We like to hang out after a presentation, get some food or a drink, talk internet, answer questions and really get to know all you folks that are both passionate about or just learning of&nbsp; the opportunities online for the first time.<br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Topics regularly include Websites: buying\/selling\/optimizing; Search: optimization, tools; Social media: real time, video, tools (twitter\/facebook\/youtube, etc); Analytics: free and paid programs.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Our educational series that started in 2011 has been well attended and pulls from our talented membership to create a regular learning track for Internet marketing topics.&nbsp; We also have our eyes open for cool events that may be a little bit different, but hopefully bring a level of take-home value you do not find elsewhere.&nbsp; Our goal with each meetup is to give our attendees at least one thing they can go home with and make a difference in their business, website or internet marketing plan.<br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We invite anyone interested in these topics to join us anytime.

The International MOMS Club&reg; is the first, largest, and fastest growing support group specifically for at-home mothers.

Since women are finding out about us and joining regularly, most likely you probably won't be the only new person there. Although some of us have lived here for years, many of us are new in town or new to motherhood! We all have one thing in common&mdash;the MOMS Club introduced us to other moms who stay home...and these moms have become our friends.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the things that make us special:\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>&mdash;We meet during the day, when at-home mothers most need support.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>&mdash;MOMS may bring their children with them to any event.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>&mdash;There are many fun activities every month for children of all ages.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>&mdash;The MOMS Club is a nonprofit corporation.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>&mdash;Mothers of any age children are welcome.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>&mdash;Each chapter performs at least one service project every year to help needy women or children.<\/p>\n<p>Every month throughout the year we host fun activities and gatherings, including local park days, trips to children&rsquo;s museums and zoos, tours of local fire stations or other businesses, and many other kid-friendly field trips. When MOMS need some time for themselves, the Club offers monthly MOMS Nights Out. Club members are also able to join existing playgroups or start their own. As a member, you will receive a monthly newsletter with a calendar of scheduled events. Feel free to participate in as many or as few activities each month as you desire.<\/p>",

We promote and create story in live performance because story is everywhere and needs a presence. We video tape and post our performances. We are storytellers willing to tell stories in the world. We are out of the clubs, the hot houses, the supportive audiences and into the streets.<\/p>\n<p>WHO: Anyone willing to practice the art and craft of story in live performance.<\/p>\n<p>WHY: massmouth was started to promote the art of storytelling in Massachusetts. We exist to bring the art of storytelling into the wider world, in the street, online and, by doing so, into the ears and imaginations of people everywhere. and open mic called a \"mouthoff\" every month and other happenings and events as planned.<br>\n\nCheck out : <a href=\"http:\/\/massmouth.blogspot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/massmouth.blogspot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/massmouth.blogspot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/massmouth.blogspot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/massmouth.blogspot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/massmouth.blogspot.com\/<\/a><br>\n\nand join at: <a href=\"http:\/\/massmouth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/massmouth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/massmouth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/massmouth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/massmouth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/massmouth.com\/<\/a><\/p>",

I expect we will share expenses such as fuel and other incidentals.<\/p>\n<p>Members are welcome\/encouraged to become Event Planners by contacting (text or phone is best) the Organizer that currently oversees administrative functions (Peter). You may have your own a ski boat or can beg\/borrow\/rent one. Ideally, Event Planners should organize a Meetup at least every other month. <br> <br> Anyone who is looking to make and meet new friends in and around the area is welcome to join. Activities are not limited and can vary, depending upon the members interests. This is your group and members are strongly encouraged to voice their ideas and opinions. <br><\/p>\n<p>I learned to waterski at seven years old. I still love to do it. <br>I have a boat and skis.&nbsp; Several other members also have their own boats, so there is variety of boats and favorite waterski locations. Borrowing equipment to learn or try is usual, just let us know.<\/p>\n<p>Where will we meet and Waterski? <br>For freshwater we trailer to nearby Rivers or Lakes such The Merrimac River, Lake Cochiutate, Chebacco Lake.&nbsp; For saltwater, around Boston Harbor or near The Cape, and as far as Newport or Providence RI where the water is warmer. You can review the past meetups for more location details. And keep in mind that we are open to exploring your favorite spot.<\/p>\n<p> <br>Let's make the best of the days of summer we have here in Boston. Let's get out and waterski!<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Asians and Friends - Boston (AaFB) is an International Friendship and social support group. Our group was established in 2001 as a grass roots non-profit to promote friendship among gay, Asians and non-Asians. Since Meetup has recently changed a few things, we no longer have an invite code and since we still want to maintain some privacy we now have to approve all new members, please be patient since we do not always check the emails daily.<\/p>\n<p>Many of our founding members are still involved in the group and we welcome new members to join all the time. We have not charged dues since the first year and now there is no cost to join. So it doesn't cost any money to be a member! But most of the events do cost money (food, drinks, admission, etc.) you pick and choose which ones you attend. Keep in mind that the organizers do have to pay money to meetup.com to run the website. If you have enjoyed and can donate please do but do not worry if you are on a tight budget we would rather you attend than stay at home because you don't have a donation. The donations do go to help cover the costs of running the groups website.<\/p>\n<p><span>The members of this group get together to meet, greet, and socialize, sharing life experiences in safe, social settings.<\/span> We provide a wide range of social, cultural, and educational activities for men and women in a gay friendly supportive environment. Regularly held activities include potluck dinners and cookouts, movie nights, discussion groups, and dinner parties around the general Boston area. Special events might include bar hopping, concerts, sporting events, bowling, museum tours, theatre groups, shows, and theme park adventures.<\/p>\n<p>We want you to join us in planning and organizing events which you feel others will enjoy as well as yourself. Please check out the ideas page and add your ideas, and VOTE for ideas or events which you would like to attend. Also let us know if you would like to assist in organizing any event, and we will be happy to help plan events as we all try to enjoy life.<\/p>\n<p>If you are only on the Yahoo group or you know someone who is only on the Yahoo group, please <span>encourage<\/span> them to sign up for this meetup group.<\/p>\n<p>If you have read this far and would like to sign up, Meetup as of May 1, 2013 has now changed and we no longer have an invite code and since we still want to maintain some privacy we will now be approving all new members, again please be patient since we do not always check the emails daily. When you sign up, you are able to restrict emails on the site so you do not get duplicated email notices, but this site is much more interactive and updated.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<br>\n\n We are Your Group help us, help you, enjoy our lives!!!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>ps, If you have sent the group an email and several days have passed by without a reply please check your spam folder and update your email system to accept our emails,\u00a0 we try not to spam anyone.<\/p>",

The chronic fatigue and pain was so debilitating it affected my work and social life. A fibromyalgia specialist suggested I try yoga to ease my symptoms. So I started practicing yoga in 2003 on a weekly basis. Within a few months, I saw my symptoms diminish dramatically. Recently I decided I wanted to share my experience with others through teaching and became a certified yoga instructor in August of 2009.<\/p>\n<p>Needless to say, yoga has been a saving grace for me (no pun intended!) It has boosted my energy, helped me gain strength and reduced my stress; thus keeping my fibromyalgia at bay.<\/p>\n<p>For those of you who suffer from this chronic illness and other auto immune diseases such as lupus and arthritis, I suggest you give yoga a try.<\/p>\n<p>The right approach for you\u2026<\/p>\n<p>I will design a program for you that will start with simple stretching and breathing techniques for mental clarity and relaxation. Then we will work our way towards asanas (poses) to help your strength and flexibility. And remember, yoga is not a competition; you can always pull back once you have reached your edge.<\/p>\n<p>The style of yoga you will experience...<\/p>\n<p>Hatha style classes blend breath work, mindfulness, meditation, and guided imagery, with stretching and strengthening. A Hatha Yoga class fosters an understanding between breath and movement. A typical class will challenge you in a variety of ways depending on your own personal level of fitness, connection to your inner self, and ability to balance\u2014physically and mentally.<\/p>",

Cultural Caf\u00e9, a fun way to explore delicious food and meet new people, holds monthly meetups at restaurants in the Greater Boston area that serve up a variety of tasty cuisines.<\/p>\n<p>We will enjoy a family-style meal mixing \"greatest hits\" with some lesser-known gems of that month's cuisine. Each restaurant will provide a cultural presentation or demonstration as part of the experience. Your meal, tip, and nonalcoholic beverages are included in the $25 price; alcoholic drinks must be paid for separately.<\/p>\n<p>Cultural Caf\u00e9 provides an opportunity for community members to experience what students experience in the Cultural Kitchen program. The setting is informal as guests gather to build community, share a delicious meal, learn about another culture, network with like-minded individuals and support a great cause!<\/p>\n<p>As we grow, we hope to begin leveraging HI-Boston's new group kitchen and dining room for special cooking demonstrations and in-house cultural dinners.<\/p>\n<p>Meetup members will need to pay for event tickets in advance. We will have a convenient online payment method or people can contact the group leader, Paul Kuhne at community.boston@hiusa.org or 617-556-5312.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Welcome to the VersatilePhD Boston group, and thank you for your interest! The main purpose of this group is to reach out and connect with doctoral students and PhD's who have gone off the beaten path to pursue careers outside of academia. There are many more of us out there than one thinks, and my hope is to build a thriving community in the greater Boston area.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nThe ivory tower isn't for everyone. Whatever your reasons for leaving the tenure track or your PhD program (or just pondering it), you need support, dignity, perspective, a little self-knowledge, and a new network of contacts. That's where this group comes in.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nVPhD holds two types of Meetups. Once a month, we meet for a Meet and Greet.\u00a0 Discussion runs the gamut from the nuts-and-bolts of translating academic skills and experience to nonacademic careers, to the more difficult project of figuring out what you actually want. Nor are we necessarily opposed to the academic world itself: some participants have left reassured that the professor track is in fact the right path for them.\u00a0 This is simply a safe space to air doubts and explore other possibilities as well as swap contacts and information.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nThe second type of Meetup is our Speaker Series.\u00a0 Each month or thereabouts, VPhD invites a former PhD, EdD, or ABD to discuss his or her successful transition into a nonacademic career. Again, the discussion may range from the technicalities of other fields and interview practices to the emotional and psychological work involved in leaving behind past professional identities, achievements, mentors, and colleagues.\u00a0 Some of the speakers will address the search for creative outlets outside the academy; others will focus on the more prosaic problem of finding a steady paycheck.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nSince this is the beginning of things to come, there will be some shuffling of things as such, but I guarantee that you will enjoy yourself and meet some great folks. I will try to plan monthly gatherings - and you are free to make any suggestions for things you'd like to do!<br>\n\n<br>\n\nCome hang out, network, and make new friends while learning about a variety of opportunities! Also, if you'd like to share about your experience navigating the job market after graduation, that would be great as well. Please contact us at [url=mailto:versatilephdboston@gmail.com]versatilephdboston@gmail.com[\/url] to get started!<br>\n\n<br>\n\nWarmly,<br>\n\n<br>\n\n[url=linkedin.com\/in\/nikkiboots]Nikki Boots, Ph.D.[\/url]<br>\n\nnikkiboots.com<br>\n\n<br>\n\nand<br>\n\n<br>\n\n[url=linkedin\/com\/in\/sarahdykstra]Sarah Dykstra[\/url]<br>\n\n<br>\n\n(Note to prospective members, particularly those who have not yet \"outed\" themselves to advisors and colleagues as academic leavers: This group is private, which means that Google will not \"crawl\" its pages.

We are a group of friendly travelers and expats who meet monthly for a drink to exchange travel ideas, tips, and stories about exciting places we have traveled to, lived in, or hope to visit soon. We welcome anyone who is interested in world travel, whether you are considering it for the first time or a travel junkie who routinely quits your job in search of your next travel fix, or somewhere in between. Hope to see you at an event soon! Please note, we do not arrange slide shows, organize group trips, or push commercial ventures on you. Unlike some other groups, we're not affiliated with travel companies looking to promote their commercial services. What we do is meet, enjoy each other's company, and remind ourselves why people who travel the world are such good fun to be around. BEWT is a non-commercial social travel group. Active solicitation of members at Meet Ups or via the Message Board by commercial organizations is contrary to the spirit of the group. Commercial Message Board solicitations will be deleted.<\/p>",

Who would you like to listen to?\r\n\r\nPerhaps YOU could be a speaker, if you have an area of expertise or are a professional in some health-related or consciousness-related field. Health professionals could give informative talks that would be educational as well as introduce your business.\r\n\r\nMeetings will range from a low or no-cost meeting where a few of us gather to read a chapter from some interesting book together and then talk about it, up to a more expen$ive all-day seminar with some nationally renowned authority.\r\n\r\nWhen you join, please answer the new member questions and tell us about yourself. Fee free to email me with requests, and also if you have a large enough home and would like to host a meeting.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPaul G.\r\n\r\n>>About me, your group organizer, if you are curious:\r\n\r\nI changed my diet and thinking back in 7th grade in 1967 in Indianapolis, Indiana. Now it\u2019s about 40 years later, I\u2019ve been living in the Boston area for years, and I\u2019m still eating a whole foods diet and continuing to develop my understanding of medicine, the human bodymind, life in general, universal law, and how to experience love and freedom.\r\n\r\nI earn my living by producing educational and transformative meetings, and by being a handyman and carpenter as well. I have learned and benefited a lot from my studies in macrobiotics, acupuncture, holistic health, emotional healing, psychology, human potential movement, Landmark Education, Process Oriented Psychology, various therapies and counseling (including Re-Evaluation Counseling, or Co-Counseling, Voice Dialogue, coaching, Guided Self Healing, etc.); Men\u2019s Work, David Deida, Alan Watts, Tom Monte, Dr. Andy Hahn, Eckhart Tolle, Deepak Chopra.

It just takes practice. Anyone of any age with any body type can do it. A general level of fitness, not brawn, is what it takes. If you can run a mile, you can do this. In this meetup we will: *Meet other active, funloving people who want to try kiteboarding *Experience the thrill of flying power kites during Kite Nights *Learn the best way to get started in the sport *Escape the winter and learn kiteboarding in Mexico or Key West with other group members *Progress safely with practice partners You'll also get access to member only discounts on lessons, travel and equipment with Boston Kite School, Boston's kiteboarding outfit.<\/p>",

Happiness comes from deep within, and not from people, situations, or circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>According to Researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of California, San Diego:<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;When an individual becomes happy, the network effect can be measured up to three degrees. One person&rsquo;s happiness triggers a chain reaction that benefits not only his friends, but his friends&rsquo; friends, and his friends&rsquo; friends&rsquo; friends. The effect lasts for up to one year.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Since whatever we focus on grows, the aim of this group is to help members focus on happiness and to spread it at every opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a happy person and want to socialize and network with other happy people, this is for you. If your goal is to become a happier person this group is for you. If you want to contaminate others with your happiness, this group is definitely for you.

CZC was founded in 1973 by early students of Zen Master Seung Sahn, the first Korean Zen master to teach in the West. We offer daily morning and evening meditation and chanting, and weekly public talks and instruction free of charge. Retreats and accommodations are offered for a reasonable price. Zen meditation is a powerful way to clear our mind of habitual thinking. It helps us to balance ourselves and our world by pointing us towards our own wisdom and compassion. New friendships are formed and support for doing this practice is found by coming together for this special purpose.<\/p>",

What are the tax implications for the different types of business structures, and what exactly is the significance of an 83(b) election? Is your intellectual property adequately protected? Should you hire independent contractors or employees?<\/p>\n<p>Everyone will tell you that a good business attorney will provide vital assistance in almost every aspect of your business. However, not everyone will tell you lawyers need you just as much. Lawyers who focus on startup issues need to be around entrepreneurs to keep their fingers on the pulse of the startup community. They need to learn from entrepreneurs modern methods of operating a business, and technologies that may influence the practice of law for years to come. And yes, lawyers need clients too.<\/p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why we created Lunchtime with Lawyers, a networking event unlike any other for both the attorney and the entrepreneur. A new concept, we envision this to begin as an informal lunchtime networking session with an opportunity for entrepreneurs to ask practicing attorneys and other professionals questions about legal issues. In the future, depending on demand, we can offer such unique activities as business plan hot-seats or roundtable discussions.<\/p>\n<p>Please join us to show us your support for this idea. Lunchtime for Lawyers: where like-minded lawyers and entrepreneurs meet.<\/p>",

I even like spending time with them more that my cats, which I thought I would never say!  Join our group and make a whole new set of friends who don't think you are crazy for owning one of the most reviled creatures on this planet, sad, but true.  Maybe we can change the world in a little way by spreading the wonder of our little friends.  We will meet on line and at memeber's houses to swap stories and just have fun!",

        "description": "<p>The Zeitgeist Movement is an explicitly non-violent, global sustainability advocacy group currently working in over 1000 Regional Chapters across 70 countries. The basic structure of The Movement consists of Chapters, Teams, Projects &amp; Events. Overall, the Chapters are essentially what define the Movement and each Chapter works to not only spread awareness about the roots of our social problems today but also to express the logical, scientific solutions and methods we have at our disposal to update and correct the current social system and create a truly responsible, sustainable, peaceful, global society. Working through global and regional educational projects and community programs, the intermediate goal is to obtain a worldwide movement, essentially unifying the people, regardless of country, religion or political party, with a common value identification that we all invariably share, pertaining to our survival and sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>It is the assumption of The Movement that the educational\/activist pressure generated, coupled with what is currently a failing social system, will inhibit and override the established political, commercial and nationalist institutions outright, exposing and resolving the flaws inherent. It is our view that the traditional mediums of politics and commerce as forces for change will not obtain the goals needed to make our social system sustainable and humane for they appear to be born out of the same traditionalist, flawed logic that has created the problems as they stand.<\/p>\n<p>The transitional goal, once such a global presence and pressure is obtained, is to implement an economic model that follows a truly scientific train of thought with respect to the technical factors that allow for human propensity, public health and environment responsibility over generational time. This new model, since it is based upon Resource Management and Natural Law (Science) as the logical starting point for all decisions and processes, is often referred to as a \"Resource-Based Economic Model\". However, the realization of this direction is not that of an institution but of a train of thought - the train of thought of objectively applying The Scientific Method for Social Concern and allowing its natural emergence to flourish without limitation as new efficiencies present themselves.<\/p>\nGeneral Observations: \n<p>In the view of The Movement, the society today has become increasingly detached from the physical world, with techniques of production, distribution and social ordering that have little to no relationship to the environment, or the current state of scientific knowledge with respect to public health and sustainability.<\/p>\nCyclical Consumption \n<p>For instance, our use of a profit based, \"growth\" driven monetary system has become one of the greatest destroyers of the natural world and sustainable human values. The entire global economy requires \"cyclical consumption\" to operate, which means that money must constantly be circulating. Thus, new goods and services must be constantly introduced regardless of the state of the environment and actual human necessity. This \"perpetual\" approach has a fatal flaw for resources as we know it are simply not infinite. Resources are finite and the Earth is essentially a closed system. To assume the need for constant consumption to keep people employed and hence the market system going is eco-cidal on a finite planet. The true goal of an economy, by definition, is to strategically preserve and create efficiency. The system today demands the opposite.<\/p>\nInfinite Growth \n<p>The Monetary-Market Model is based upon money being treated as a Commodity and its origination from Debt; sold for Interest Income. This is a \"Ponzi Scheme\". Each time this Commodity (Money) is sold (Bank Loans) it needs to be paid back (Debt) with more money charged as a fee for profit (Interest). The problem is that the Interest Value required to settle the debt does not exist in the Money Supply outright. In other words, Bankruptcy and Default are not byproducts - they are inevitable \u2013 as there is always more debt outstanding than money in existence. This creates severe, offset monetary scarcity that oppresses many people on many levels.<\/p>\nThe Value of Scarcity \n<p>Likewise, the intents inherent within the monetary system derive a strategic edge from scarcity. This means that depleted resources are actually a positive thing for industry in the short term for more money can be made off each respective unit. This is contextual to the monetary law of Supply &amp; Demand and hence \"Value\" in economics. It creates a perverse reinforcement to ignore environmental problems and the negative consequences that create scarcity; not to mention reinforcing technically unnecessary human deprivation. This system does not\/can not meet the needs of the many because it isn't financially efficient to do so.<\/p>\nProblems\/Inefficiency = Profit. \n<p>Similarly, the system also requires problems\/constant consumer interest in order to work. The more people who have cancer or cars that breakdown, the better the economy due to the servicing of those problems. Needless to say, this also generates an inherent disregard for human well being and the environment. Sustainability, efficiency, and preservation are the enemies of this model.<\/p>\nCost Efficiency &amp; Irresponsible Obsolescence \n<p>There is also the Cost Efficiency mechanism that demands cutting expenses to remain \u201ccompetitive\u201d in the marketplace. Every single product created by a corporation today is immediately inferior by design for the market requirement to cut creation costs in favor of lowering the output \"purchase price\" to maintain a competitive edge automatically reduces the quality of any given item by default. It is impossible to create the \"strategically best\"\/long lasting anything in our society, which translates into outrageous amounts of wasted resources and time. Likewise, this same mechanism is reinforcing the environmental disregard, depletion, and pollution that we see as a constant in the world today\u2026 among other issues.<\/p>\nWaste &amp; Oppression of the Human Resource \n<p>As far as Occupations today, we need to ask ourselves what the point is of a given focus and why it is necessary. The fact is, most jobs today are not directly related to the actual necessities of life. Rather, most are artificial concoctions created in order to keep people employed so they can maintain purchasing power in an environment where our technology continues to expand exponentially, displacing humans from the production force.<\/p>\n<p>It is a common statement in politics today to hear about \"creating jobs\". Well, in theory, an occupation could be created where people are paid to sit in a room and test chewing gum all day, everyday... but is that a viable use of the human mind? Should we relegate our mental capacity to simple any so called job due to mere \"economic\" reasons, regardless of what it actually contributes to personal and\/or social development? This becomes even more bizarre as a train of reason when we realize that Mechanization not only frees us from labor, it is actually more efficient and productive due to the exponential advancement of science and technology.<\/p>\n<p>On a different level, the very reality that each human being is required to be put in a position of servitude to a corporation or client in order to gain income to purchase the necessities of life not only perpetuates the waste of the human mind and human life, it is also a form of oppression \u2013 slavery. If we combine the aforementioned \"Infinite Growth\" point above regarding the Debt pressure that is build into this system, we see that the combination of the guaranteed Debt imbalance and the requirement to submit to Labor, regardless of its purpose\/effect, in order to gain monetary income to survival \u2013 is a structural form of oppression against the lower classes (who hold the most debt and need for more period income).<\/p>\n<p>As noted, advancements in science and technology have shown that we can automate a great deal. The more we have applied mechanization to labor, the more productive things have become. Therefore, it is not only negligent for us to waste our lives waiting tables, working at a bus station, fixing cars, or other repetitive, monotonous jobs, it is also entirely irresponsible for us not to apply modern mechanization techniques to all industries that it is possible for, apart from strategic resource management, this is a powerful way to achieve balance and abundance for all the world's people, thus reducing crime generating imbalances.<\/p>\n<p>The fact is, the Market System cannot maintain itself with any viable integrity anymore for corporation will continue to save money through automation, displacing human labor- which also displaces purchasing power, continuing the inevitable loss of \"growth\" that defines this system.<\/p>\n<p>In the end, today\u2019s society now has access to highly advanced technologies and can easily provide more than enough for all of the earth\u2019s people. This is possible through the implementation of an economy based on scientific resource management and applying modern methods. This is the purpose of The Zeitgeist Movement- to create a global awareness to thus transition into a new, sustainable direction for humanity as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>",

We dont tend to play the longer ones when we have large groups but they are available for play usually. They are a step more advanced than your typical monopoly, scrabble and risk games. We may have all played these games in the past but we dont anymore. If you wish to learn these types of games feel free to join us as we are always up for teaching new players.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some of the games we play are played on Wil Wheatons youtube show Tabletop.

We will have a blast hitting golf balls into a net and viewing individuals swings with the state of the art V1 software. You will see your swing next to the tour pros and have swing comparison done. You will leave the group so excited to play this season. This will be a laid back group and no questions are dumb questions.

        "description": "<p>Boston Armizare (formerly SSG Boston) is a martial arts group practicing an integrated system of longsword, grappling and dagger, taken from the early 15th century fighting manuals of Fiore dei Liberi, who wrote the earliest comprehensive system (L'Arte di Armizare) for teaching Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) that has survived to the present day.\u00a0 We also work from other historical Italian, English, German, Spanish and French manuscripts, working both in translation and producing our own translations and interpretations. At this writing, we have classes in Newton and Arlington\/Cambridge.<\/p>\n<p>Our students are a mix of experienced martial artists who enjoy the cross-training and interested brand new folks. Our beginner class works equally well for each, working on a combination of longsword, abrazare (grappling) and daga (dagger\/knife) skills. We also host workshops with outside experts and periodic gatherings with other groups to exchange ideas, spar, and just have fun.\u00a0 These skills are drawn from direct translation from our historical sources, developed through multiple physical interpretations and tested at speed.\u00a0 Though we emphasize historical technique, our training sessions are a blend of interpretation, drill, and both focused and open sparring. Intermediate and more advanced students continue their work on the core techniques of grappling, dagger and sword, and expand to other weapons like pollaxe or bastone, or combat in armor.<\/p>\n<p>Start with a Foundational class (four classes and annual membership), which we offer ~5 times per year; after that monthly fees are $40\/month\/location.\u00a0 Come wearing comfortable workout clothes &amp; flat shoes (worn-out sneakers are best).\u00a0 Men need groin protection (cup), but other equipment can usually be lent for a time.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/6\/e\/0\/event_225990432.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left\"><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>",

He has taught at\u00a0several well known\u00a0colleges and\u00a0more recently at the ICA in Boston. \u00a0With over 450 successful events and workshops already held, this group is one of the premier New England photography teaching groups.\u00a0 The classes and workshops invariably receive a maximum rating and rave reviews from our members. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If you are looking for just a social gathering of photographers and are not looking for paid instruction you are very welcome to stick around and join our occasional free meetups - we love to hang out with other photographers!\u00a0\u00a0If you are serious about improving your photography skills with some Top-class instruction at a great price, then this is the place for you.<\/p>\n<p>Either way we don't charge a membership fee.<\/p>\n<p>Read the group reviews and you will be assured that the workshops offered by this group are uniquely special and of a very high quality.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that many of the workshops have a very strict limit on numbers and payment is required in advance. To maintain the high quality of attention provided by such a small group approach it is necessary to have a policy of no refunds or credits of any kind if you cancel or don't show. This enables the classes to be kept cost effective and keeps the cost down to a reasonable level for everyone.\u00a0 Of course, if the class is cancelled or has to be re-scheduled then a full refund is given.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>",

If this sounds like you, we'd love to have you joins us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Currently, we meet on the second Saturday of every month at Framingham Public Library. Each critique session generally lasts about two hours and one or two works are critiqued.<\/p>\n<p><strong>THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE REQUESTING TO JOIN<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>MWC runs on an attendance-based system. This means the more meetings you attend, the more likely it is we'll review your work. New members still have ample opportunity to have their work critiqued.<\/li>\n<li>The three words that embody our critique process are honesty, respect, and discipline.<\/li>\n<li>MWC runs a biannual audit of its membership. Members who have not participated in the group for six months will be removed from the membership unless they request to remain in the group.<\/li>\n<li>Despite how serious all these points sound, we're still a fun bunch of people, and have one or two social events a year. Writers need to socialize, too. :)<\/li>\n<li>Curious about some of our members?

Fresh, alive and simple, they are touch points of sanity and happiness for many friends.<\/p>\n<p>There are drop-in groups each week on Friday mornings at 9. W<span>e sit for about 40 (the time goes quickly in a small group) and then have a cup of tea. \u00a0There is no charge and donations are welcome. \u00a0They support these circle and the good energy, kindness and wellbeing in our neighborhoods and community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you've been meditating on your own, these groups can really jump-start your sittings. It's an amazing effect to sit with a group in stillness. If you're new at meditating, you can either just show up (it's easier than you might think because it's natural!) or, send a note to me and come a little early and I can give you some tips. I look forward to seeing you here!<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and if you want to know more about Sacred Spaces, you can visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sacredspaces.ws\/%C2%A0\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sacredspaces.ws\/\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sacredspaces.ws\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.sacredspaces.ws\/<\/a><\/p>",

This Meetup Group will focus on doing that. This is a private group, however all <span style=\"color : #000000\">adults are welcome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>ABOUT THIS GROUP<\/strong> - This is a\u00a0group of fun and friendly people who share a common interest in hiking. \u00a0We pride ourselves the fact that we've taken many from the couch to the trail and have advanced to levels beyond their expectations all while having a great time with fellow hikers. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">To become a member you must have a <span style=\"color : #ff0000\">recognizable facial photo<\/span> of yourself that we use to identify you at our events along with a positive attitude to match our spirit :)<\/span><\/strong>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>WHEN WE HIKE<\/strong> - We hike any day of the week all year long. \u00a0Our weekday hikes tend to be in the afternoon to accommodate after work schedules while our weekend hikes can start at any time. \u00a0We often have several hikes posted on the same day to accommodate different levels and skills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>WHERE WE HIKE<\/strong> - We primarily hike in the Blue Hills Reservation for the vast majority of our hikes. \u00a0Sometimes we may offer hikes in the greater Boston area. \u00a0However, rather than to re-invent ourselves we have partnered with one group that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/random-hikers\/\">Random Group of Hikers<\/a> which has proven itself to be one of the most successful hiking groups in New England focusing on more challenging hikes in New England and beyond such as the Adirondacks, Main, and the White Mountains. \u00a0Once you feel you've reached advanced Blue Hills hikes then be sure to sign-up with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/random-hikers\/\">Random Group of Hikers<\/a> for one of their events.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"color : #000000\">Voluntary Membership Dues -<\/strong> <span style=\"color : #000000\">There are<\/span> <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">NO<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">membership dues to join this club. \u00a0However, donations are welcome for any amount. \u00a0Although it does cost to maintain a meetup group I choose to pay for that myself. \u00a0100% of the donations go towards door prizes at our annual anniversary hike and party. \u00a0As a thank you for those who donate you get a special title \"Skyline Member\" under your name on the site.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>ABOUT THE BLUE HILLS<\/strong> - The Blue Hill<\/span>s were so named by early European explorers who, while sailing along the coastline, noticed the bluish hue on the slopes when viewed from a distance. More than ten thousand years before those Europeans arrived, Native Americans made their home in the hills. The Natives referred to themselves as Massachusett, or \"people of the great hills\". Eventually the Europeans began settling in this region. The colonists built houses and barns, cleared fields for crops and livestock and logged the hillsides for lumber.<\/p>\n<p>In 1893, the Metropolitan Parks Commission purchased the lands of Blue Hills Reservation as one of the first areas set aside for public recreation. Today, the reservation is rich in both archaeological and historic resources. Sixteen historic structures listed on the National Register tell the fascinating tales of Native Americans, explorers, farmers, quarry workers and inventors. Additionally the Blue Hills Weather Observatory, a National Historic Landmark, sits atop Great Blue Hill, as a crowning feature.<\/p>\n<p>The living treasures of the Blue Hills include flora, fauna and natural phenomena \u2013 from coyotes to copperheads, dogwoods to lady's slippers, and turkey vultures to dragonflies. Trails traverse upland and bottomland forests, marsh, swamp and pond edges, meadows and an Atlantic white cedar bog. A great variety of plant and animal life thrive in the diverse habitats, including several rare and endangered species in Massachusetts, such as the timber rattlesnake.<\/p>",

Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia and J.K Rowling's Harry Potter books, and even contemporary mainstream works, such as Audrey Niffenegger's <em>The Time Traveler's Wife<\/em> and Margaret Atwood's <em>The Handmaiden's Tale<\/em>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Our group meets regularly to critique <strong>original<\/strong> writing projects (novels, novellas, short stories, etc- no fan fiction, please). We don't focus on writing exercises; rather, we share already written projects (or portions of projects in the case of longer works) for reading\u00a0in advance, and then critique them at our meetings.<\/p>\n<p>At each meeting we critique approximately two pieces, depending on length and availability, and pieces are available in advance for download via our Files section.\u00a0<span>Part of our time may also include discussing craft, techniques for improvement, and preparing works for future publication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We have also added regular informal writing nights, where members get together to just work, work, work on whatever ongoing projects they might have. And we schedule occasional meet ups for author appearances or conventions, social nights, and hold informal (fun!) writing competitions.<\/p>\n<p>This group is open to\u00a0writers with experience\u00a0from amateur to published, but we're looking members who are <strong>serious about writing, submitting, and meeting regularly,<\/strong> as well as having a basic handle on the craft itself. To ensure this,\u00a0we ask that everyone interested in joining please email a writing sample (for example, a short story or first novel chapter, preferably in your preferred genre) to the\u00a0Group Organizer. Once you request to join, the GO will respond to you with information about where to submit this. (In addition, members who join up but don't visit the site for over three months and\/or don't attend any meetings are removed in the interest of keeping our numbers reflective of <strong>active<\/strong> members.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you are a dedicated spec-fic writer who is looking for a writing group that will motivate you to keep working on a project, as well as providing useful critique, this is the group for you! We've been meeting regularly now for over three years, and are looking forward to many more!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\"><span style=\"font-size : small\"><strong>To best benefit our writers, we keep our numbers low and limited to regular participants. All new members will be subject to a \"trial membership\" and asked to attend a couple of meetings before joining permanently. This is in no way meant to be exclusionary; we are simply looking for members who are good fits for the current (awesome!) group dynamic.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\"><span style=\"color : #ae3333 ; font-size : small\"><strong style=\"font-size : small\">Please make sure to fill out your profile in it's entirety when requesting to join. If it sounds like you'd be a good fit, an Organizer will contact you with instructions on where to send a sample.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>",

Hackers use the digital equivalent of duct tape to whip out code. Hacker-journalists try and bridge the two worlds.<\/p>\r\n<p>This group is to bring all these people together -- those who are working to help people make sense of their world. It's for hackers exploring technologies to filter and visualize information, and for journalists who use technology to find and tell stories. In the age of information overload, all their work has become even more crucial.<\/p>\r\n<p>This group aims to help members find inspiration and think in new directions, bringing together potential collaborators for projects and new ventures.<\/p>\r\n<p>Please also check out our site at <a href=\"http:\/\/hackshackers.com\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/hackshackers.com\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"http:\/\/hackshackers.com\" title=\"http:\/\/hackshackers.com\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/hackshackers.com<\/a><\/a>, along with our question-and-answer site at <a href=\"http:\/\/help.hackshackers.com\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/help.hackshackers.com\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"http:\/\/help.hackshackers.com\" title=\"http:\/\/help.hackshackers.com\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/help.hackshackers.com<\/a><\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Help us build the future of media!<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>The aim of this group is to help more people become aware of the power of minerals in the human body.<\/p>\r\n<p>Today, we're living in a stress-filled environment and our mind and body require more nutrition on a daily basis than our ancestors did. Unfortunately, we're getting less nutrition from our food than our parents and grandparents did. Often excess hunger and cravings for certain foods people experience reflect the body's need for nutrients that aren't sufficient in the diet.<\/p>\r\n<p>A major cause of the problem is that our farm soils themselves are very depleted in nutrients, and as a result, our foods (even organic) are deficient in major and trace minerals, which are also among the cofactors needed to utilize vitamins. Mineral deficiency is affecting our health and increasing the risk of chronic or degenerative diseases later in life. Supplementation is now necessary if we want to achieve even adequate health, however, there are issues of safety, absorption and efficacy.<\/p>\r\n<p><span>Getting adequate minerals in the diet can be of benefit for people with <\/span>ADD\/ADHD, allergies, arthritis, asthma, depression, diabetes, digestive disorders (celiac, Crohn's, IBS, malabsorption), fatigue, headaches (including migraines), herpes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, immune system balancing or strengthening, insomnia, mental clarity and focus, psoriasis and other skin diseases, stress, and autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, lupus and others), weight loss, women's health issues.<\/p>\r\n<p>This Meetup will be of interest to anyone concerned with preventative healthcare or specific health conditions, as well as healthcare practitioners of all modalities. Let's meet and discuss our options - food, herbal remedies, supplements and supplementation choices, food preparation methods, soil amendments, etc. For more information, see the \"About\" page and the files under \"More\".<\/p>",

By doing this, you will become more confident and comfortable when doing any kind of public speaking.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can be at any level of experience, and you're not limited to one type of presentation, as long as it's under 7 minutes.  To illustrate, here are a few of the many types of presentations our members can do:<\/p>\r\n<p>- Storytelling (either personal, business, or folktale) <br><\/br><br><\/br>- Short, informative speeches (5-7 minutes) <br><\/br><br><\/br>- Stand up comedy routines <br><\/br><br><\/br>- Your elevator speech for networking events<\/p>\r\n<p>Our motto is - \"Personal growth through public speaking\".  In other words, you'll learn how to be a better, sharper communicator by learning how to communicate your ideas to a small, supportive group of people.<\/p>\r\n<p>Is this group for you?  Well that depends.  Let me ask you a few questions...<\/p>\r\n<p>- Do you have a story from your life that you've always wanted to tell, but you're not sure what to do first?<\/p>\r\n<p>- Have you always wanted to learn how to do public speaking, or perhaps overcome your fears around it?<\/p>\r\n<p>- Do your friends tell you you're a \"ham\" and that you belong on stage?<\/p>\r\n<p>- Do you have some life lessons that you've learned, and would like to share with others so they can benefit too?<\/p>\r\n<p>If you said yes to any of these questions, then this group could be just what you've been looking for.

We have a saying in Parkour \u2013 \u00catre fort pour \u00eatre utile - To Be Strong Is to Be Useful.

This 'art of displacement' requires neither specific structure nor accessory for its practice. The body is the only tool. It's an athletic discipline accessible to all, because it combines all the natural skills of the human body: running, jumping, climbing, etc. It's a utility sport that permits exploration of the potential offered by your body. It's about being able to face the obstacles with which you are presented, whether they be in the natural environment or in the urban environment, in a search for movement that combines effectiveness and control.<\/p>",

The goal of our group will be to provide an opportunity to work on our crafts, to finish projects that have sat waiting for attention for too long, and to learn some new techniques, skills or entirely new crafts with warm friendly people. We will get together to crochet, knit, stamp, and bead, or what ever your portable project is. We will be meeting on at least a monthly basis at a coffee shop in the Arlington, Burlington, Waltham area.&nbsp; Please note that this is social group and we do not allow any business \/ commercial use of this site. I would also like to include a charitable element to our group. There are many organizations such as Project Linus, Warm Up America, Rosie&rsquo;s Place and the Pine Street Inn that are in need of hand made items such as squares for afghans, scarves, hats, mittens and blankets. Passing your work on to someone in need is a very rewarding experience and I hope the members of the group will join me in helping others.<\/p>\n<p>Please join us at one of our events soon!<\/p>",

However, the group is not exclusively for jazz connoisseurs. Anyone who has an interest or would like to just sit, listen, and maybe sway to some great jazz tunes, can join us as well.<\/p>\n<p>We will endeavor to offer our members live jazz events without a cover. However, in cases when we can\u2019t, we will try to broker with clubs and venues special reduced admission fees for our members.<\/p>\n<p>In order to become a member of our Jazz in the City Meetup group, we ask you to pay nominal membership dues of $10 per year. Any way you look at it, it\u2019s a great deal \u2013 where else can you listen to top-notch live jazz in the best venues (and meet other fans while you\u2019re at it) for mere pennies per event? And, you will receive additional benefits and discounts from our various partners and sponsors throughout the year. So your $10 really goes a long way and is a pittance, all things considered!

Together we develop our ethical ideals, celebrate life's joys, and support one another through life's crises. We work for the improvement of our world and for the future of our children. Membership is open to those who agree with our principles regardless of race, religion, or national origin.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n As ethical humanists, we believe it is important to understand the complexity of modern life. We live in a changing society and we want to help it change in a way that is helpful to humanity. Like traditional religious groups, our values are important in our lives and social actions, but they are not limited by dogma or tradition.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n The Ethical Society is part of the larger Ethical Culture movement whose member societies are joined together through the American Ethical Union, headquartered in New York, NY, which has about two dozen societies in the U.S. The AEU belongs to the International Humanist and Ethical Union with branches in about 100 countries worldwide.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n We hold Sunday Platform Meetings in the Humanist Hub, 30 JFK St. on the 4th floor, Cambridge, Massachusetts each Sunday from 10:30 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. on a more or less academic calendar. Meetings are free and open to the public. Platforms include a featured guest speaker and discussion, readings, and music. We cover a wide range of social, political, environmental, emotional, and interpersonal issues - including matters of war, peace, and justice.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n We also give a series of short courses called the School for Ethics that explore ethics in society, in personal relationships and in the arts. We present an annual Humanist of the Year Award each Spring.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n We also have a range of social events, including potluck suppers, nature walks, book discussions, and a movie group.<\/p>\n<p>For more information, visit our website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bostonethical.org\">www.BostonEthical.org<\/a><\/p>",

(The Friends Meeting House is located at 5 Longfellow Park, Cambridge, MA  02138) The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p>\r\n<p><span>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/span><\/p>",

We are a group of folks who enjoy taking Adventures with like-minded people. The trips that we offer will take us to places well off the beaten path and to places that you will want to explore and savor for a lifetime.<\/p>\r\n<p>Have you ever wanted to see the sun rise over the ocean while being in total seclusion; have you ever wanted to Mountain Bike along old trails that were once trade routes? Have you ever wanted to leave all of the planning to someone else so that you can just enjoy the ride? If these are the types of things that you seek, then you have come to the right place.<\/p>\r\n<p>Through the trips you will forge new friendships, see unseen places and have a lot of fun while doing it all. Trips may include food, lodging and gear transportation as described in the event description. We look forward to hosting many adventures including those centered around Mountain Biking, Road Biking, Hiking and Kayaking.<\/p>\r\n<p>Scott <br \/>Cloud9 Adventures Organizer<\/p>",

Then join us!<\/p>\n<p>Did you come of age during the Cold War and scandals like the Iran Contra affair? Did you spend hours watching MTV when all it showed were 24-hour music videos? Did you play with a Rubik's Cube or try to clear the last level of Pac Man? Did you ever have the hallmark \"big hair?\" Do you remember the original Pop Rocks and the \"New Coke?\" Can you do all the \"arm moves\" for <em>Y.M.C.A.<\/em>? And did you truly get tired of hearing your doctor refer to you as a \"mother of advanced maternal aged?\" (I did!)<\/p>\n<p>If yes... then...<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/a\/2\/2\/event_107435362.jpeg\" width=\"200\" height=\"179\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left\">You should join other like-minded moms for playdates, coffee, lunch, free activities at local libraries (like story time, music shows, magicians) and other kid-friendly activities. We plan Moms' Night Out once each month for some grown-up conversation. Our calendar is bursting with fun activities that include kid-friendly outings, playground playdates, and library events. We welcome all suggestions for activities.<\/p>\n<p>Our group is designed primarily for stay-at-home <strong>mothers of children from newborns to kindergarten<\/strong> who are able to take part in daytime events, but working mothers are certainly welcome. We plan some weekend events to accommodate those who can't meet during the day.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/9\/a\/c\/event_107367052.jpeg\" width=\"229\" height=\"172\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : right\">We welcome diversity and differing opinions, and hope that we can cultivate a close-knit group of mothers connecting around their kids. Moms who share an interest in attachment parenting, breastfeeding, eating healthy and organic, co-sleeping, the \"no-cry sleep solution,\" baby wearing, cloth diapering, green living, recycling, alternative or holistic medicine, or natural parenting are especially encouraged to join. But ALL are welcome!<\/p>\n<p>Expectant mothers and stay-at-home dads welcome, too!<\/p>\n<p>We hope this group can be a great source of support and friendship. If this sounds like a good fit for you and you live in the <strong>MetroWest Area or just beyond,<\/strong> we hope you decide to join us!<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n <em>*This group has been listed as \"private\" in order to protect ourselves and our children from internet predators.

Then come and take a class at Nirvana Yoga!<\/p>\r\n<p>A guided meditation in motion, yoga is a place to explore peace and find relaxation through a physical practice. Nirvana yoga classes are taught by Helen Coyne, a lifelong dance and fitness enthusiast who has been practicing yoga and Pilates for more than a decade.<\/p>\r\n<p>Trained to teach in the Yogaworks&reg; method, Helen blends the Iyengar and Ashtanga traditions to create a vinyasa flow with a strong emphasis on alignment principles in a practice called Energetic Flow. Each pose is designed to help significantly improve your posture, increase your range of motion and flexibility, strengthen joint stability and mobility, and enhance the function of every system in the body.<\/p>\r\n<p>With detailed instructions for every pose and skillful sequencing, Helen will guide you to a deeper understanding of yoga and the benefits to your body, enriching your yoga practice. By moving through a series of vinyasa flows, maintaining longer postural holds, and linking breath to movement, you'll ignite your body&rsquo;s internal heating system, allowing for deep tension release and stimulation of the relaxation response.<\/p>\r\n<p><br><\/br><br><\/br>visit: www.nirvanayogaclass.com for more details.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>-Mission statement: It is my sincere hope this club will be a haven for those who have tried to find worthwhile people in all the usual places (clubs, bars, parties, conventions) and only came up empty.  I want myself and the club members to truly take life back and live a sensible, humane, warm, compassionate, artful, and full life again in this country.  I am forming this club largely as a reaction (and hopefully solution) to the declining quality of human interaction in the US.  I have my theories about why this decline is occurring, but I&rsquo;d rather reserve talking about those for the club&rsquo;s initial meeting.   <br><\/br><br><\/br> -I would like the core focus and format of this club to be more intimate and low-key to facilitate interpersonal connections and meaningful conversation.  I will have a topic, presentation, or discussion question to begin each meeting and we will see where the meeting goes from there.  Certainly, more larger scale events such as film screenings and trips to museums or dinners out will be a part of the club too.   <br><\/br><br><\/br><br><\/br>-Even though I am the organizer of the club, I encourage others to step up and lead certain meetings.  Their particular passions and hobbies should be their guide for these meetings. <br><\/br><br><\/br>-And to conclude, perhaps a few anonymous posts on a website dedicated to people considering leaving the US sums it up best: &ldquo;I want a place where I can live among the people and help and heal. I want a place for people to come lay down and rest awhile...&rdquo; and &ldquo;I'm just a regular guy wanting to focus more on the quality of my life than the incessant drive for more hours, less quality of life and higher fees, payments, charges by the utility, telecom, pharmaceutical, \"health care\", and education system monopoly near you.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>***Please Check out the Photos and forums section of this meetup page!!<br><\/br><br><\/br>---------------------- <br><\/br><br><\/br>This club may be for you if:<\/p>\n<p>-You&rsquo;ve ever been called &ldquo;an old soul&rdquo; more than once <br><\/br><br><\/br>-You just know there&rsquo;s something very wrong with modern American culture.  More specifically, how the breakneck pace of technology that has become the wallpaper of our lives has made us less adventurous, loving, romantic, earthy, caring, open, and spontaneous.  Instead it has made us feel blah, stale, disconnected, numb, unfulfilled, and distracted.  But you also realize every age has its drawbacks and there is no golden age and you must make the best of any era. <br><\/br><br><\/br>-You don&rsquo;t slavishly serve and identify with one political\/philosophical\/ideological\/religious group because you know life is too complex and rich to see the world through only one lens.  Besides, you know what it truly means to be open-minded: being open to give-and-take in a conversation and not being afraid to be wrong because you like learning worthwhile things from people.<\/p>\n<p>-Your patience grows ever thinner for having to learn new technology seemingly every month.<br><\/br><br><\/br>-You are naturally suspicious this is a feel-good new age group.  It isn&rsquo;t.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-You understand that truly committing to anybody (be it friend or lover) is a risk and don&rsquo;t shy away from the emotional ups and downs that it entails.  That is, you don&rsquo;t cling to the chic &ldquo;misanthrope&rdquo; tag because you are adult and brave enough to take risks on people and risk disappointment and hurt feelings. <br><\/br><br><\/br><br><\/br>-You have a sneaking suspicion that art is all that matters <br><\/br><br><\/br><br><\/br>-You constantly strive to simplify your life and think twice before letting more technology into it. <br><\/br><br><\/br><br><\/br>-You continue to be a good person even though you fully realize you may never receive the full reward or recognition you deserve for being one <br><\/br><br><\/br>-You die a little every time you see canned &ldquo;inspirational&rdquo; speeches by politicians\/celebrities with the usual platitudes (&ldquo;Live like every day is your last,&rdquo; &ldquo;Carpe diem!&rdquo; etc) <br><\/br><br><\/br>-You&rsquo;re fed up with the glut of entertainment and media for the 14-year-old male demographic and wonder where all the art and entertainment for mature, adventurous, intelligent, and sensible adults is. <br><\/br><br><\/br>-You wonder how much easier life would be if you were easily amused at mass entertainment like most people and not have to seek out more rarified art and entertainment to satisfy yourself <br><\/br><br><\/br>-You wish people who are jealous and\/or intimidated of your rarified taste and intelligence would know just how difficult and isolating it can be to be that way and it&rsquo;s not really that enviable. <br><\/br><br><\/br>-You realize that bad taste is essential sometimes.  Plus it can be a lot of fun.<\/p>\n<p>-You resent being called &ldquo;dude.&rdquo;<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">Living On Purpose: Starting the Year with a Powerful Resolution and Resolve<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">Each year, we make a commitment to ourselves for ourselves: to change something. Or to give something up. Or maybe to start a new project, or learn something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">For most people, the coming year is going to be very important on many levels &ndash; financially, our relationships \/ interrelationships, and in our personal development.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">And the New Year is a powerful time to create this change and prepare for the coming year. We can create the highest and most potent version of ourselves with a vision of who we have always known we were supposed to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">When we live the life we were born to live: we tap into the powers of inspiration, will, dynamic energy and passion for living. We become unstoppable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">Sometimes is it hard to change: there are pressures from our lives: work, relationships, obligations, friends and society. Or habits that feel impossible to break. And sometimes, change feels more difficult than simply &ldquo;suffering&rdquo; the consequences of leaving things as they are. Or perhaps we need more will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">But there is knowledge about how to do this: it comes from ancient cultures and it&rsquo;s been developed over centuries. It gives us a map showing us on how to make a plan and to harness energy to create stamina and power. We learn how to unleash inspiration, enthusiasm and self-confidence to help you maintain and follow through with all your goals!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">This meetup will be a series of talks set to create the right environment to create a successful year &ndash; one of vision, commitment and exceptional results. We will study exactly what you need to get support for your success in the New Year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">The individual talks in the series will be:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">1. Creating a program for a successful 2011 using real goals. And in the beginning of the New Year, doing a powerful practice to make them a reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">2. A review of the past year: what worked, what didn&rsquo;t and what you want see different in the upcoming year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">3. Understanding specific astrological aspects of the coming year and creating an individual program: what is our outlook and destiny for the year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">4. Picking and prioritizing our goals correctly so we are working with our power and essence to create the life we were born to live.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">5. How to manifest more energy in our lives to make the changes possible: the secrets of Aharata &ndash; a special lineage of empowerment<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">6. How to protect what you&rsquo;ve created in your life from stress, negative relationships, aggressive behaviors of others, pressure from people and the culture around us as well as how to work with ourselves to remove the obstacles to success: self-sabotage, low self-esteem, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">7. What will be the principles of financial success in the new coming year and how to use them in our lives: to maintain what we have gained and expanding our business or career!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">The practice and program are simple but extremely effective&ndash; and doing them in the beginning of the new year &ndash; creates a preparation and intention for the coming year. When you start with an intention, empowered by knowledge, practice and support &ndash; you have all of the components to make your life more powerful, fulfilled and complete.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">I hope you will join us on this remarkable journey of understanding our individual destiny and creating a toolbox of knowledge and practices to make it reality in the New Year!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">THIS COURSE SERIES WILL BE TAUGHT BY POWERFUL AND EXPERIENCED TEACHERS TRAVELING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, HELPING PEOPLE WHERE EVER THEY GO, TO BECOME THEIR HIGHEST POTENTIAL.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">Each has a minimum of 10 years full time teaching, and each brings a unique aspect of the knowledge to creating the plan of your perfect life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #1a2558\">Blessings<\/span><\/p>",

These women are also looking for travel companions, some of you might travel alone, others with a friend or relative. Our ladies are married, single, widowed and divorced, who are interested in traveling in the company of others.<\/p>\n<p>Why not join us\u2026.make some new friendships, share some laughter, stories and create some new memories. Enjoy the camaraderie and security of being with a group of women, who knows you may develop &nbsp;friendships that will last a lifetime.<\/p>\n<p><span>WHAT WE ARE NOT....we are not a group that goes for super sale deals off season (Mexico in August)...I would not post a trip to Bermuda during high hurrican season, but rather in Mid June- early July when chances are better for better weather.&nbsp; Same is true to International travel, we try not to travel on high peak dates, but maybe a little earlier in the season or later, after all who wants to see Italy in the cold\/rain.&nbsp; Also a lot of the super saver deals you see online ARE NOT available for group.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>When filing out information for a roommate...PLEASE be honest on your questionaire form, we do not want to pair up a snorer with a non snorer, that would not make a good vacation for either!&nbsp; We do get snorers and have others to match them with.&nbsp; So again, please be honest!<\/p>\n<p>The only age requirements we have is you must be 21 years of age. I have found that when I travel I end up mingling with all various age groups and sometimes have had the best time with girls in their 20\u2019s and on the next trip a group of ladies in there 60\u2019s or 70\u2019s. Net, net age is not important, it\u2019s the person within!<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll design all our vacations for women, including activities and accommodations.<\/p>\n<p>We will try to chose vacations based on interest.<\/p>\n<p>Your interaction in our meetup is very important. For this group to be a success we will need members to leave feedback, and responding to correspondence.<\/p>\n<p>Please be respectful of others in the group.&nbsp; Being disrespectful is grounds for removal from the group.<\/p>\n<p><span>NO VENDORS&nbsp;are to be listed on site without prior approval from the Organizer, or you may be removed from this meetup.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>NO TRAVEL PACKAGES can be sold to other members (ie you purchased a trip outside of our meetup and cannot make it).&nbsp; Without prior approval from the Organizer, or you may be removed from Meetup.&nbsp; This is for your protection.<\/p>\n<p>All trips are posted with terms and conditions, when you sign up for the trips offered you are subject to the terms and conditions which you are agreeing to by signing up and putting down a deposit for the trip. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>On occasion members may list a trip they are attending to put it out to the group in the event they may wish to join that member at a destination. &nbsp;If you are interested in that event you make your own reservations with the hotel or vendor, it is listed here for informational purposes only.<\/p>\n<p>Women's Travel Group\/Flynn Travel &amp; Tours INC, &nbsp;is in no way responsible for any lost deposits due to late cancellations or late final payments.<\/p>\n<p>If paying by PAYPAL you are responsible for the fee's associated with your payment.<\/p>\n<p>PARKING IN AREAS TO MEET A TOUR BUS: &nbsp; Parking is at your own discretion, will anyone guarantee nothing will happen? &nbsp;Absolutely NOT and The establishment, nor our group or the tour company will take any responsibility for your vehicle. &nbsp;Any time we leave vehicles anywhere and carpool or travel you assume all responsibilities. &nbsp;The lots are not guarded and you park at your own risk. &nbsp;To date we have not had any issues anywhere we have parked. &nbsp;If you want a guarantee then I suggest you get a ride to any of our pickup locations to board the bus. &nbsp;The establishments are gracious enough to offer us to park in there lot at no charge.<\/p>\n<p>Indemity Agreement: By joining our meetup group you agree to hold the&nbsp;Women's Travel Group and it's organizer, Flynn Travel &amp; Tours, INC and Co-organizers free from liability or responsibility what so ever with regard to any negligent or intentional conduct of any third party including but not limited to Tour Company, Property Owners, etc. resulting in the loss of personal property, physical injury, monetary loss with regard to an event\/meetup.

In the beginning we will probably get together infrequently, mostly for 2 or 3 night trips; the more people get involved, the more opportunities we'll have to meet up to talk and then go out to practice!<\/p>\r\n<p>Imagine hiking into the woods with only a small day pack with gear, sleeping in a shelter that you built without tools, cooking food over a fire that you started from twigs, and leaving in the morning with only a few footprints to indicate anyone was ever there. &nbsp;If you've ever wished you could leave the world behind and just head off into the woods, this is the group for you!<\/p>\r\n<p>Skills you might learn with us include, but certainly aren't limited to:<\/p>\r\n<p>Fire lighting <br \/>Shelter building <br \/>Survival psychology and strategy <br \/>Priorities of survival <br \/>Attracting attention <br \/>Use of sharp implements <br \/>Knife\/Axe sharpening <br \/>Acquiring food <br \/>Basic knots <br \/>Improvised cordage <br \/>Wilderness cooking <br \/>Sourcing safe water <br \/>Camp craft <br \/>Basic stalking <br \/>Camoflage and concealment <br \/>Emergency first aid <br \/>Survival equipment selection <br \/>Wilderness hazard identification <br \/>and more!<\/p>",

We will learn about the elements, the moon cycles or the current trend in the universe, it all depends. Basically we will learn to read charts and start putting everything together from our basic Astrology knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>Practice makes perfect when it comes to learning about Astrology, so reading many charts is the best way to gain experience. Bring your own chart, too, and we can compare aspects in others' charts to your own.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>",

You work for a company that is known by just letters, an engineering firm, a software start up, a biotech company or something similar and would like to meet a person that understands the demands of your job because they have similar experiences and goals. You realize that there is more to life than 70 hour work weeks and are looking for a change. This group will schedule regular social events for after work drinks, dinners, games&nbsp;or other gatherings where you can meet singles in your area and industry. We can&rsquo;t promise that you&rsquo;ll meet a soulmate but you will expand your professional network. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re shy or gregarious, qualitative or quantitative,&nbsp;in&nbsp;R&amp;D or sales, all professional singles are encouraged to join.<\/p>",

We're hoping to get together with any larger breeds who like to play and run too. We live in\u00a0Southie, but we\u00a0especially like Cat Rock Park in Weston. We\u00a0are open to anyplace we can be off-leash in a safe or fenced place.<\/p>\nWe welcome all sizes of dogs as long as they and their owner are comfortable with large dogs who may play more roughly or just seem to due to their size. Please be sure that your dog will be comfortable with a group of up to about 8-10 big dogs (I don't limit the number but that's about the most we've had at one meetup). This group is set up so that anyone can suggest and schedule a meetup, not just me. If you'd like to go somewhere particular, feel free to suggest a meetup and if at least 2 other people RSVP \"yes\" it will go out to the group.",

        "description": "<p>About &nbsp;- Introductions By Diana LLC<\/p> \n<p>Is the typical Boston singles scene off putting to you? &nbsp;Maybe it is too young, too predictable or too lonely. <span>Many people join and are looking for meetups specifically for Boston singles events over 40, over 50.<\/span><\/p> \n<p>Now is the perfect time to try something new in a bright, warm and inviting environment, courtesy of Diana.<br> Diana ensures all of her guests feel welcome and are properly introduced to other diners at each event. &nbsp;Events are held in private spaces of upscale restaurants in and around Boston. Cost of admission for a dinner party typically includes a cocktail hour and a four course meal. Between each meal, participants switch tables to ensure everyone has proper time to spend with one another. &nbsp;<br> And, unlike other dating events you may have attended, every event offers a 50-50 split of men and women.<\/p> \n<p>Diana is not a match maker. She simply eases the stress or awkwardness of first time meetings with old-fashioned proper introductions, offering a human touch to interpersonal relationships that is often missing in the modern world.&nbsp;<br> Come dine with us. We think you will be happily surprised by the people you will meet!<\/p> \n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

There is no end to this addition. The way to find peace and clarity is to know the real world, the True world, by subtracting the past that has been recorded and stored within the body and mind as pictures.<\/p>\n<p>There is nothing more valuable than one's mind. It shapes the entire world that one knows. Through subtracting in Maum Meditation the Universe mind will remain.\u00a0 This mind is always at peace regardless of conditions. It is the mind where there is no more ups and downs.<\/p>\n<p>Become free of the limitations imposed by the past. These pictures dictate thoughts, emotions, desires, behaviors and health. Although these pictures are illusions, people unknowingly live within these illusions thinking they are real.<\/p>\n<p>Maum Meditation is a non-profit organization that exists for the sole purpose of bringing people out of the mind world they are living in that includes stress, fear, anxiety, sadness, loneliness, resentment, anger, judgment, separation, boredom, purposelessness... all sorts of pain and burden.<\/p>\n<p>The human mind is an accumulation of pictures of the past which create false limitations, habits, and a fixed, narrower mind. By subtracting the human mind with the method of Maum Meditation, people can remove the source of all disturbances. Even one's body will become healthier through practice since stress and other emotions cause so many health problems.<\/p>\n<p>People live according to what they have in their minds. Through subtraction one's mind will change to the Universe mind and always follow the flow of nature. People will come to clearly know meaning and purpose in living.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone from any background is warmly welcomed. Come to know Truth directly from within without any reference to what one has found or been told in the past. Maum Meditation does not tell people to believe or not believe something, but through subtraction, they confirm for themselves. When the human mind changes to the Universe mind it is born again and never dies.<\/p>\n<p>--- What People Say About the Meditation ---<\/p>\n<p>\"Throughout my entire life I always felt like there was something missing. So I kept adding more and became stressed, but Maum Meditation was just the opposite. Instead of adding, Maum Meditation provided a simple method of subtraction. After subtracting my past I began to change my mind; how I viewed the world. The method of subtraction allowed me to get rid of my 'self' and my self-centered mind which controlled my speech, thought, and action. Maum Meditation allows me to live freely, without judgment and with gratitude.\" - Ben \/ Foster City, CA<\/p>\n<p>\"Maum Meditation transcends the boundaries of all religions. It will elevate the human mind to the highest level of existence; the level of divinity. That is where peace is; the element that is meant to control the universe. Once we achieve a permanent peace, we can give it to others.\" -Dr. Charles Marcieca \/ International Association of Educators for World Peace. UN-NGO<\/p>\n<p>\"I have tried other forms of meditation in the past, but none stuck because they lacked the method of subtraction. Shortly after I started Maum Meditation I found that I began to clear my mind and open my heart to a new Joyous feeling.\" -Clara \/ Santa Clara, CA<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Come to an introduction!\u00a0 Wednesdays at 7pm and Saturdays at 3pm<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Please call for seating or if you have any questions: 781-643-2651<\/p>\n<p>Or email: yujin4200@gmail.com<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We have guided sessions throughout the day 365 days a year:<\/p>\n<p>9:30am, 11:30am, 1:30pm, 3:30pm, 5:30pm, 7:30pm, 9<span>:30pm<\/span><\/p>",

New England has the best seafood on the East Coast, and there are SO many avid fishermen and fisherwomen (fisherpeople) in the area. We just don't know about each other! <br> Fishing enthusiasts have many reasons to band together and go in a group. <br> 1. Share resources- if members go together, they can save on equipment, bait, boats, carpooling, lures, and more!<\/p>\n<p>2. Share knowledge- What are \"busting fish?\" What are \"slicks?\" What is the correct lure for medium sized saltwater game? When are where can you find small mouthed bass in MA? NH? ME?RI?<\/p>\n<p>3. Share dinner!!! What is better than grilling your freshly filleted catch with friends at the end of a long day of fishing?<\/p>\n<p>Members are welcome\/encouraged to become Event Planners by contacting (text or phone is best) the Organizer that currently oversees administrative functions (Peter). You may have your own boat\/kayak\/canoe or can beg\/borrow\/rent. Ideally, Event Planners should organize a Meetup at least every other month. <br> <br> Anyone who is looking to make and meet new friends in and around the area is welcome to join. Activities are not limited and can vary, depending upon the members interests. This is your group and members are strongly encouraged to voice their ideas and opinions. <br><\/p>\n<p>Please get involved today. You have been granted the power to suggest new events. Check with your friends to see who else may want to join in the fun. Thanks to Aspen for getting this going! Now, its yours to make what YOU want out of it.<\/p>\n<p>To get get a new meetup on the calendar, suggest all you need is a Title\/Headline, Place and date&amp;time.&nbsp; When 2 more people rsvp yes it's a meetup. Don't be discouraged if it takes a few tries. Its OK. Just put up what you were going to do anyway and see if someone else can join you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

Iaido was practiced by the ancient Samurai for centuries.<\/p>\r\n<p>Iaido consists of a number of techniques, or waza, that represent combative situations where generally one or more opponents initiate an attack. Although the waza represent combative encounters, the deeper purposes of iaido are to develop mental discipline, awareness, and mental and physical harmony through practice and control of body and sword movements.<\/p>\r\n<p>Iaido is not considered a sport, but rather an ancient traditional art based on a unique oral tradition for the development of mind, body, and spirit. This art form has been passed from teachers to students in an unbroken line over hundreds of years, so it is the responsibility of each practitioner to learn and practice the techniques correctly so that the tradition is preserved and can be passed on intact to the next generation.<\/p>\r\n<p>Muso Jikiden Eishin Ryu, meaning \"peerless, direct transmission, true faith style\", is the most widely practiced style of Iaido in Japan. It has a lineage of roughly 450 years, making it the second oldest martial art form in Japan.<\/p>",

The group was started to bring together intelligent people who like dining together and having the kinds of discussions they don't get enough of elsewhere. Our dinners are held at low key restaurants that have good food and facilitate good group communication. In addition, we may also go to movies, lectures, or other events that engender thoughtful discussion at a restaurant afterwards. In warmer weather, picnics may also be scheduled. <br> <br> Our events won't necessarily have a particular discussion topic, but an \"ice breaker\" question may be suggested as a way of introducing yourself to the group. <br> <br> Although the group is based near Cambridge\/Somerville , our intention is to hold events in different parts of the Boston area, to allow folks from those areas to conveniently participate. <br> <br> Come join us and be a part of our community.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Welcome to Boston's Tier 1 Riders! We are a fun, dynamic, and diverse group of sport bike riders who love to ride! As a motorcycle group\u00a0we're always looking for new adventures wether it's a few hours long, a day trip, or an overnight. Unlike other motorcycle groups you may have ridden with, we are kind and curtious to all riders, which means we will never leave anyone behind, always make the meet up stop convenient for everyone, and we always know where we're going since we have learned from other group's mistakes.\u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n We're always gearing up for long weekend trips to places such as the Catskill Mountains and Nova Scotia. We also do a lot of meet up rides for dinner and drinks, Lowel Bike Nights, cookouts, riding with other area sport bike groups, as well as being open to any other ideas members may have. We ride at a fairly quick sport bike pace, though we always put safety first. Most of all, we want to have fun riding. So come on out and join up... we guarantee you'll be back for more!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Motorcycle styles that will be accepted into the group by BT1 are as follows:<br>\n\n<br>\n\n a. Superbikes<br>\n\n<br>\n\n b. Supersports<br>\n\n<br>\n\n c. Street Bikes<br>\n\n<br>\n\n d. Dual Sports<br>\n\n<br>\n\n e. Sport Tourers<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/youtu.be\/mf5DxUyMqTc<\/p>\n<p>Dan<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>DISCLAIMER: By joining this group I acknowledge that motorcycle related activities are dangerous and that accidents causing death, bodily injury, disability and property damage, can, and do happen. I acknowledge that I have motorcycle insurance coverage as required by Massachusetts state laws. I acknowledge that I am responsible for my own actions and behaviors while riding a motorcycle within the group.<\/p>",

We will have salon style discussions over great food and wine as we strive to grow and nurture the artist within each of us.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you consider yourself first and foremost an artist and photography is just the medium you use to express your vision then this is the group for you.<\/p>\r\n<p>This group will be run totally on a non-profit basis but to ensure that members are serious in their intent and to discourage the frivolous their will be an annual membership fee of $15 which will go towards maintaining the group, providing accommodation and food and wine for the salon style meetings.<\/p>",

We believe that these two groups of people will benefit the most by supporting each other and learning from each other as a single community. This enables us to leverage our relationships and collective wisdom for the growth of each member.<\/p>\n<p>To facilitate this we have a number of community building blocks:<\/p>\n<p>1. Meetings for adults with ADHD<\/p>\n<p>2. Meetings for adults who have a close relationship with an adult who has ADHD<\/p>\n<p>3. Meetings for couples in which one or both people have ADHD<\/p>\n<p>4. Special events where everyone can come together and get to know each other<\/p>\n<p>5. Online discussions on this website<\/p>\n<p>We are excited about the possibilities for this community. Please join us!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>HISTORY:<\/p>\n<p>Marcel and Ose began this support group with the idea that we would build a community that offers support, connection, education, and resources for fellow adults who have been affected by ADHD.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, the ideal is that from this community would merge a model of being that could inform the outer society. That rather than label, blame, judge, hold to rigid ways of operating in this world \u2013 those participating, with or without ADHD, would learn to observe without judgment, be creative with their resources, learn from one another, build on passions, hone skills, enjoy one another, and collaborate on various endeavors for the benefit of interesting and meaningful projects and outreach.<\/p>\n<p>We hope that this group will thrive by its diverse leadership \u2013 formed from within and without. Led by those with, without, and professionals working to help this field. Ultimately, it might be great to have a board of professionals helping to guide the educational piece.<\/p>\n<p>THE VISION FOR ADULT ADHD SUPPORT COMMUNITY<\/p>\n<p>Why this meetup group<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To provide a supportive space, community, and access to resources that enable those affected by ADHD or debilitating distractions\/disorganization\/impulsivity to find information, connection, support, and resources so they not only survive but thrive.<\/li>\n<li>Because there are many people trying to go the journey alone \u2013 and it is much more fun, interesting, and fruitful to help one another.<\/li>\n<li>Because there are very few support groups for Adhd out there<\/li>\n<li>Because the path to help for ADHD is not an easy one. And perspective, good information, and support can make all the difference.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>",

Although initially they wanted to master such topics as parliamentary law, improve their social skills and their knowledge of literature, the club soon became a forum where Cantabridgeans could meet over dinner to discuss current events and listen to a debate about immigration, women\u2019s rights or the like. Today the club meets six times a year at the Gran Gusto restaurant, 90 Sherman St., in Cambridge on the first Monday of the months of February, March, April, October, November and December. All meetings start at 6:00 PM with a social hour, followed by dinner at 7:00 PM and a featured speaker at 8:00 PM.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our Members are usually former college educated graduates who still like good conversation and a good lecture!

We also offer larger events to support each other in our success in relationships, with our families, in our careers and in our communities. You may also visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mdijawbone.org\">www.mdijawbone.org<\/a> or\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.backbonedivision.com\/\">www.backbonedivision.com<\/a> for more information about our circle of men.<\/p>\n<p>Jawbone and Backbone are both circles of men affiliated with MDI which is an organization in the United States and Canada. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mdisuccess.com\">www.mdisuccess.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We inspire men to pursue a purpose larger than themselves; while we recognize that, to be effective, men must confront their life challenges and personal demons, we do not seek to devote our time focusing solely on the individual.<\/p>\n<p>We empower men by providing them with the tools they need to succeed. These tools are discovered and put into use in weekend trainings or weekly courses, one-on-one mentoring or weekly team meetings. As an organization we believe that true wisdom comes not from a single source but from the diverse viewpoints of our community of men.<\/p>\n<p>We pursue our passion by being in relationship with the men of our team; they provide the inspection, feedback and support necessary to get the job done. When we stumble, our teammates are there to get us back on our feet, brush us off, and ensure we have learned the lessons from a setback or challenge before we get back into the game.<\/p>\n<p>When we realize our passion, and then start to manifest it, we have a circle of men to celebrate with. These men acknowledge our victories and the unique qualities we bring to the world; this allows us to continue to carry our personal legacy forward to our families and communities.<\/p>\n<p>In a nutshell: We are unconditionally committed to men winning in their lives.<\/p>",

After experiencing the sights and sounds of Africa, it became clear that many of the things we take for granted, most of the people there either never had or need more of, but will likely not be able to achieve without help from outside.  Some of those things include medicines, school computers, and much more.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align : justify\">The A3D group is always looking for friends and volunteers who can put their skills to good use.  We host an annual festival in Salem every July (complete with artists and vendors, musicians and performers, even a moon bounce), we raise money for useful items (desks and computers for a school in Senegal), to name a couple of active projects, and we have a good time doing all of this.  We meet regularly in Salem, Massachusetts and welcome you and any guests you would like to invite to attend any and all of our gatherings.  There, we discuss current projects, what needs to be done, and what we would like to do.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align : justify\">We look forward to meeting you soon.<\/p>",

Led by Senegalese native Mamadou Diop, MAMADOU is an eclectic group of musicians who have truly formed a guitar and drum led sound that is all their own (enough to win the 2011 Boston Music Award as International Artist of the Year). The music they produce is made for dance, and drumming and percussion are integrated into their live shows, getting the audience to move their feet to the beat! The best way to appreciate MAMADOU is to experience their performance LIVE. With lyrics sung in several languages, the positive messages of the ensemble are conveyed through the universal language of music. If you like to dance, enjoy quality live music, or are just looking for something different, then you'll want to join this group.<\/p>",

There are adult-oriented events including a monthly book club, mom's nights out or mom's nights in (such as Oscars night or wine and cheese events). For the kids, there are playgroups, meet-ups at local playgrounds and play spaces, and outings to places like Connors Farm and Look What I Made. And for the whole family, we have events such as a our Halloween party and Dinner and a Movie Night Out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Since the group consists of both working and stay-at-home moms, events are held both during the day and at night or on weekends. There is also a strong focus on creating ties within our community, as evidenced by our partnership with the NR library and our presence on NR Patch as a Local Voice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This is a fully volunteer\/member run group. All meetups in our group are organized by members and dues go towards running the site as well as towards special group events. We ask that you pay your dues promptly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>For prospective members, please note that we ask you to provide a photo to help identify you at meetups.

        "description": "<p>Drumming cleanses the soul, organizes the mind, coordinates movements of the body, and just feels good! Mamadou Diop is from Senegal, West Africa. He has performed with some of the biggest named musicians in his country, and he KNOWS music and rhythm. It is his joy to teach what he has learned, bringing the rhythms of not just Senegal, but all of West Africa to whoever wants to learn them. Join this group if you are a drummer, want to be a drummer, or are just curious what African drumming is all about. All skill levels are welcome at his classes! Bringing your own drum helps, but there are some drums available if you do not have one. Just be ready to have fun!<\/p>\n<p>The first sound we ever heard while still in our mother's womb, was the beating of her heart, and the rhythm of her breath. No matter our race, gender, age, religion or belief system, this common experience exists for all human beings.<\/p>\n<p>When newcomers are first introduced to drumming as adults, they often say \"oh, I don't have any rhythm,\" in an attempt to excuse themselves for their imagined inadequacy.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is:&nbsp;<strong>We All have Rhythm!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Rhythm is our natural inheritance. It exists in our bodies, our hearts, our breath. It exists in the vibration of atoms, the cycles of the seasons, the ticking of clocks, the orbit of the earth. There is no part of creation that is without rhythm!<\/p>\n<p>Drumming is a practice that spans the globe and has a presence in every culture. It has been used for centuries in rituals, ceremonies, communication, rites of passage, music and dance, celebration, healing, community building, and cultural events.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Drumming Therapy<\/strong>&nbsp;is a method of utilizing the natural power of rhythm and music and applying it to an individual or group for the purpose of healing. A truly holistic healing approach, group drumming breaks down social barriers, promotes freedom of expression, non-verbal communication, unity and cooperation. Drumming awakens dormant emotions and unexplainable feelings of excitement, peace, and ecstacy. It decreases depression, anxiety, and stress, boosts immune system functioning and benefits physical health.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Please note that you must have a recognizable picture of yourself that includes your face as one of your Meetup photos in order to have your membership request approved. \u00a0This is so that our event organizers can recognize you at our events. \u00a0Thank you!<\/p>\n<p><span>Welcome! This group is for those in Boston who like to play strategy (and slightly silly) games and be social at the same time. It is perhaps easiest to break this down word by word:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Strategy games: We will not be playing Apples to Apples, LCR, or even Monopoly here. Instead, the gaming focus of this group will be on strategy games, games that make you think and plan ahead, such as Ticket to Ride, Dominion, Puerto Rico, Settlers of Catan, Power Grid, Agricola, and many more. Of course, we don't expect that you know how to play all these games; we will always welcome newcomers and will sometimes be learning these games ourselves for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>Slightly silly games: Munchkin, Killer Bunnies, and Fluxx are examples of \"slightly silly\" games. Do note that there's still strategy involved, but we certainly welcome games that make us laugh while we're playing!<\/p>\n<p>Social: To be clear, this group will be as much about the gaming as the social interaction, which is why it's different from other such groups in Boston. But if you see the person next to you as simply someone to beat and nothing more, then this is not the group for you.<\/p>\n<p>From the gaming groups I've been to (and run), there is a clear set of gamers in the Boston area who very much like these types of games, and who like the idea of possibly forming friendships with their fellow players, and that's who I'm looking for!\u00a0 If you think you'd like this kind of interaction, sign up and come to one of our events. And if you have questions, don't hesitate to contact one of the organizers. See you soon!<\/p>",

Our goal is to create an environment that's welcoming, fun, and educational.<\/p>\n<p>A paradox...<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The argument for open source (\"free\" as in speech) software is stronger than ever.<\/li>\n<li>GNU\/Linux has been wildly successful in the server market.<\/li>\n<li>Desktop GNU\/Linux operating systems like Ubuntu Linux provide a rich end-user experience on par or better than commercial rivals in many respects.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>...Yet the uptake of using GNU\/Linux as an end-user (desktop\/laptop) operating system still lags. This Meetup aims to end that by:<\/p>\n<p>1. Creating a community of GNU\/Linux on the desktop enthusiasts.<\/p>\n<p>2. Providing a venue where GNU\/Linux questions can get asked by users of all levels.<\/p>\n<p>3. Fostering GNU\/Linux on the desktop evangelism. Let's spread the word!<\/p>\n<p>We welcome long time GNU\/Linux enthusiasts, those who've heard of GNU\/Linux but aren't even sure what it is, and everyone in between. Join us!<\/p>\n<p><span><strong>We're part of <span>BLU<\/span>!<\/strong> <span>BLU<\/span> is the <strong>Boston Linux &amp; Unix User <span>Group<\/span><\/strong> and has been meeting actively since 1994.\u00a0 <span>BLU<\/span> does a fantastic job of covering topics across the broad spectrum of GNU\/Linux, from technical topics to end-user topics.\u00a0 I'm excited that <span>BLU<\/span> has invited our <span>group<\/span> to become a <span>sub<\/span>- <span>group<\/span> of theirs.\u00a0 This gives us tremendous support from more experienced users and allows us to coordinate events.\u00a0 As a <span>sub<\/span>- <span>group<\/span>, we aim to focus on using GNU\/Linux on the desktop and attracting new and less technical users to the platform.\u00a0 To learn more about <span>BLU<\/span>, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blu.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www. <span>blu<\/span>.org<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>",

Our photographers shoot in a wide range of locations from the New England mountains to our coastlines, islands,<\/span> <span>city streets, and abandoned properties in out of the way places. Many members also shoot in exotic places around the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In 2013, our name changed from South Shore Night Photographers and Mass Bay Last Minute Meetup, and we expanded our focus to include a members exhibit in a brick and mortar gallery. It was met with great enthusiasm by members, the public and the press. In August, we opened our second annual night photography show at Laura's Center for the Arts in Hanover, Massachusetts with 45 framed pieces by members. It runs through September 21. In the year ahead, watch for new group shoots, workshop offerings, social gatherings, field trips and online competitions judged by professionals. (Please note: while we try to make our locations physically accessible for all, sometimes that is not possible.)<\/p>\n<p>NPy isn't for everyone, but for those of us mesmerized by the world after dark, we discovered it's a magical time to be out with a camera in the company of friends. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>To begin finding your way in the dark, we\u00a0recommend reading Jennifer Wu's book, \"Night Sky Photography: A Field Guide for Shooting After Dark.\" Load it onto your iPad as it makes a great field reference when you are out shooting. It is available on Amazon, <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/NightSkyFieldGuide\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span><strong>NENP<\/strong> on Meetup.com is a place to learn about and participate in our group shoots, then sharing the results with one another in the photo albums attached to each meetup. We also post photography news such as where members are exhibiting work or places where you can submit photos in competitions.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Night photo shoots can be difficult -- from needing to be aware of the terrain to watching out for people who would do you harm -- and that's why we encourage shooting with groups or photo partners.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Thank you for helping <strong>NENP<\/strong> keep fine art Npy alive in New England. Together we are sure to creatively find our way in the dark.<\/p>\n<p><span>Cheers,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Kate Hannon, Founder &amp; Co-Organizer<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Linda Szabo, Co-Organizer<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>P.S. If you don't already belong to them, there are other night meetup groups in New England that still organize group shoots. Each group has its own distinct personality, and\u00a0you'll find they go to different locations at different times and dates. Please feel free to join up and go on some of their shoots, too. It's all good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Photo Credit: Stata Center \u00a9Connie Pooler 2014, Used with permission.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Welcome! You have made the important first step in meeting a group of people who share many of the same feelings that you are experiencing right now. This group has been in existence for a number of years on Boston's North Shore, however, our members come from all over New England. The group is very unique in that members have diverse backgrounds. This includes a wide range of professions, trades, economic and religious backgrounds. Over time, feedback from the people that join our group has been that they find comfort in meeting others who know what the divorce\/separated experience is all about. Each meeting, the group is facilitated by nonprofessionals. It is important that you know that we are simply a group of concerned people helping people. Tremendous bonds of friendship have been forged and continue beyond the scope of the group. The comfort that you will find in this group has helped hundreds of people over the years and is a testimony to the longevity of the group. You be the judge...we invite you to attend our next meeting. The meetings start at 7:00 p.m. on the 2nd and 4th Wednesday of every month. Everyone that attends our meetings, understands what is said in the meeting, stays in the meeting. Confidentiality is respected and you are encouraged to speak on your own terms and when you are ready. Meetings generally last approximately two hours. There are social opportunities that take place in addition to our meetings, if you choose to participate. The comment is often made that people wish they had found this group sooner. Several members who at one time were going through the divorce process continue to stay active in the group because they feel that they have something to share with others who are going through this phase in their life. We hope you will join us.<\/p>",

These are our regular \"sittings\"-- meetings in which we practice sitting and walking meditation, read a short passage on the dharma (Buddhist teachings), and share our insights into the teachings and trying to bring mindfulness practice into daily life. You can come to any of these sittings without RSVPing.<\/p>\n<p>We also have occasional days of mindfulness, when we gather for a more extended period (usually only half a day, despite the name) to practice together a bit more intensively. These days of mindfulness often focus on some particular theme.<\/p>\n<p>New people who want to learn more about meditation and mindfulness are always welcome at any of our regular sittings or days of mindfulness. One of our experienced members will be happy to introduce you to the basics of the practice and answer and questions you have.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>For More Information<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our website: <a href=\"http:\/\/bostonoldpath.org\">http:\/\/bostonoldpath.org<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Our Facebook page: <a href=\"http:\/\/facebook.com\/BostonOldPath\">http:\/\/facebook.com\/BostonOldPath<\/a><\/p>",
