Programs and tools for individuals, schools, businesses, organizations, the City of New York agencies, institutions, etc. are now in place.

Tastings will be provided, and hopefully we can engage with one another in a positive manner where different venues can be coordinated","lon":-73.9400024414,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":139278952,"name":"Rohan Duggal"},"members":47,"name":"Washington Heights Wine Meetup","id":13578832,"state":"NY","urlname":"Washington-Heights-Wine-Meetup","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":40.8400001526,"who":"Wine Enthusiasts"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Madison","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1395930792000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"life-sciences","name":"Life Sciences","id":26384},{"urlkey":"pharmaceutical-sciences","name":"Pharmaceutical Sciences","id":26385},{"urlkey":"pharmaceutical-industry","name":"Pharmaceutical Industry","id":72514},{"urlkey":"biotechnology","name":"Biotechnology","id":109595},{"urlkey":"science-startups","name":"Science Startups","id":763232},{"urlkey":"funding-life-science-startups","name":"Funding Life Science Startups","id":1034562},{"urlkey":"translational-research","name":"Translational Research","id":1034572},{"urlkey":"life-science-commercialization","name":"Life Science Commercialization","id":1124622},{"urlkey":"life-science-professionals-networking","name":"Life Science Professionals Networking","id":1124632}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Launch-NJ-Life-Sciences-Hub\/","rating":4.79,"description":"<p>The Healthcare industry is changing from vertically-integrated to distributed.

Through the group process, you will learn to give yourself permission to express yourself fully in all aspects of your Self, to recognize the good and the healthy, while unraveling the strategies and contexts that keep you stuck. We will partner to uncover that which has been shunned or pushed to the dark and forgotten--those destructive behaviors and unfulfilling relationships that limit your emotional growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #006666\">My way of being and working with you is warm, respectful, authentic, honest and compassionate. As a group facilitator, my role is to facilitate and move the conversation forward, while attending to the group process and your present moment awareness. The power of group lies in the unique opportunity to receive multiple perspectives, support, encouragement and feedback from other individuals in safe and confidential environment. These interpersonal interactions can provide group members an opportunity to deepen their level of self-awareness and to learn how they relate to others. The Relationship Circle can be a safe and supportive place to experiment with new ideas and ways of being. Together we work at creating a space where you can experience profound change rather than merely talking about change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"color : #90C600\">Group Format:<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #006666\">The format of the groups will often be topic-driven (structured) as a jumping off point to create powerful conversation.\u00a0 Other times, group members are encouraged to bring in their relationship issues.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #006666\"><span>\u00b7<\/span>\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color : #006666\">The group size is limited to 14-16 people<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #006666\"><span>\u00b7<\/span>\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color : #006666\">This is an open group for men and women<\/span><\/p>\n<p>NOTE:\u00a0<span>For those who are interested in deeper work, there is a closed-group that will be running on Wednesday, April 16th, 2014.

Basically that works with the 8 players splitting into two 4 player teams and then drafting and then helping each other strategizing deck builds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I also want to mix things up with Constructed formats as well (most likely using Modern decks) or Standard draft days, depending on what everyone wants to do.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Anyway...if you think you'd be interested join the group and lets play some Magic.<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/d\/c\/highres_350473532.jpeg","photo_id":350473532,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/d\/c\/600_350473532.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/d\/c\/thumb_350473532.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":141144472,"name":"Kris D'Agostino"},"members":167,"name":"NYC: Magic the Gathering - Weekly Battles","id":13800682,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Magic-the-Gathering-Cube-Draft","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Mages"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Nanuet","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1396987005000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"poetry","name":"Poetry","id":222},{"urlkey":"fiction","name":"Fiction","id":15113},{"urlkey":"creative-writing","name":"Creative Writing","id":15322},{"urlkey":"authors","name":"Authors","id":15844},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"writing-workshops","name":"Writing Workshops","id":18167}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CuppaPulpCILK119\/","rating":5,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cuppapulp.com\/creative\/\">CILK119<\/a>&nbsp;is a shared workspace located in Nanuet, NY. &nbsp;CILK119 includes Cuppa Pulp Writers' Space and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rockland-County-Makerspace\/\">Rockland County Makerspace<\/a><span>.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Look for Cuppa Pulp on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Nyack-Lit-Meetup\/\">Nyack Lit Meetup's<\/a> page, too.&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-74.0100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":100801042,"name":"Donna Miele"},"members":43,"name":"Cuppa Pulp Writers' Space at CILK119","id":13806792,"state":"NY","urlname":"CuppaPulpCILK119","category":{"name":"literature\/writing","id":18,"shortname":"literature-writing"},"lat":41.0999984741,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1397027996000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"reladvice","name":"Relationship Advice","id":3301},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"support-group","name":"Support Group","id":15275},{"urlkey":"emotional-support","name":"Emotional Support","id":18260},{"urlkey":"cheating-spouses","name":"Cheating Spouses","id":35168},{"urlkey":"how-to-live-after-being-cheated-on","name":"How to Live After Being Cheated On","id":56912}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Chumps-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"Here's a call out to anyone in NYC who have been cheated on by their partners.

I want to share my story and experiences with &nbsp;other women out there who are or could be in the same situation I once was in. My goal is to support and help as many women as I possible &nbsp;can If I only reach one woman to understand the dangers of an abusive relationship and from the devastating &nbsp;effects abuse of any form can have on a woman ( I myself know this only too well) then I have accomplished something worth doing. Abuse ladies comes in many forms abusive men are also known as sociopath- narcissistic- antisocial sociopath) antisocial sociopath is what my ex- husband was actually diagnosed with when he was sent to prison. I would like everyone to bear in mind that regardless of what problems these men may have there is no excuse in anyway shape or form for their behavior or to abuse or mistreat another person in fact statistics have shown these men know exactly what they are doing and to who they are doing it to also that they are not capable of empathy or remorse statistics have proven that a very small- very small I empathize here percentage of abusive men change please keep that in mind.I have been through extensive therapy and still attend therapy once a week I have researched and read numerous books on abuse all kinds of abuse I have attended Many domestic violence meetings and groups I was asked to speak at a domestic violence benefit back in 2012- I will post my speech on the site- I do this because one it helps me to understand things on a different level regarding domestic violence , myself and the behavior of the abuser . SECOND it gives me the information and knowledge I need to help myself and other woman &nbsp;before it could possibly be to late. I had another group located in Brooklyn before starting this one that actually went extremely well but I had gotten sick for a little while and &nbsp;had to closed that group because I wasn't well enough to keep up with it. I have a GREAT amount of compassion-understanding and an anonymous passion to reach as many women as I can to help them realize abusive relationships are not normal or healthy in fact they are extremely dangerous not only just on a physical level but financially -Verbally and can be extremely emotionally devastating to the point where our self-worth and self-esteem are almost nonexistent everything I write here is because I have been through it and without support and the right people in your life it can be extremely hard to overcome it's sad to say but the truth is some people may never overcome what &nbsp;they have been through but with support and the right people and knowledge we can heal. it has &nbsp;been my experience that only people who have been through the same situation can really feel and understand our pain I remember I had two women in my last group one woman said to me he doesn't really abuse me he just hits me once in a while and calls me names another woman said and this is the woman I asked to leave my group said that it was okay for men to behave verbally or abusive because that's how she grew up and what her parents did and that it was excepted back then I do not agree with this at all please don't get me wrong I was not being mean or un sympathetic the woman I'm talking about is actually a friend of mine I tried to make her realize that this is not acceptable and that no one has the right to mistreat anyone then or now so I simply said if this is your beliefs &nbsp;on this matter that it would be better if she didn't attend the group just for the fact that I did not want any woman or anyone to think that abuse is acceptable or okay She actually understood we are still friends but unfortunately she thinks it's okay for men as she puts it to get a little crazy and I believe for this reason she is not able to have a healthy stable relationships for long periods at a time I will always be there for her and love her very much I have faith that one day she will get it right I also might add that at times I let her know that she is welcome to attend the group to listen and learn. My story goes something like this and I'm sure a lot of women can relate I met my ex-husband Jeffrey in early 2009 Jeffrey was loving understanding very giving very caring told me all the things I wanted to hear At the time when I met Jeffrey I had just recently come out of a relationship it wasn't an abusive relationship just that the gentleman I was with who was actually a very &nbsp;good man had gotten caught up with drugs wouldn't get help and I didn't want to be in that type of relationship that type of relationship isnt &nbsp;abusive but it is however dysfunctional in my opinion okay back to Jeffrey it was only a few months before Jeffrey's true colors came through it &nbsp;kind of started very saddle almost as if you wouldn't notice &nbsp;it But I saw it from the start. at that time because of my own insecurities and self-esteem I chose to ignore it and pretend nothing was wrong &nbsp;so what started &nbsp;with verbal abuse neglect disrespect eventually ended in physical abuse I was verbally abused almost on a daily basis with some of the most cruel hurtful words I have ever heard if Jeffrey didn't get what he wanted or if you didn't act the way he thought you should be he became very angry and aggressive I should mention I hid Jeffrey and our relationship from my family for most of the time we were together why you might say? for one because I knew he was an abusive man But at that time I believed I loved him and didn't want anyone to say why don't you leave him get away from him I had so many insecurities and my self-esteem you couldn't pick up with &nbsp;a shovel that in my head I thought it was better to be with him because my mind was telling me who would want you Antoinette as time went on the abuse got worse and worse verbal abuse constantly physical abuse to the point of a blackeye a dislocated shoulder many &nbsp;bruises &nbsp;lifting the mattress in the air while I was sleeping and throwing me off &nbsp;the bed hitting the dresser against the wall which has now cost me several herniated disc standing and arguing with him one day he grabbed my feet well my ankles which caused me to land on my back and hit my head and causing more injuries now to my neck I remember for some reason a particular time that stands out in my head Jeffrey and I had just gotten married it was only two weeks after our marriage we had a huge fight and I threw him out and he went to stay in a hotel I found out months later he actually had an affair with a prostitute in that hotel I didn't know that at the time I took him back I let him came back home and &nbsp;and he wanted to have sex So we had sex in the Middle of sex he decided to grab me and push me half out the window naked calling me a whore telling me I like it let everyone see the whore u are this was Jeffrey's way of humiliating me and getting back at me for throwing him out Jeffrey as most abusive man are extremely manipulating not to mention they can be very charming and that is how they are able to &nbsp;get you to want them even more manipulating abusive men tend to look for vulnerable weak insecure unstable &nbsp;women they are on the prowl for easy prey I'm sure some of you must be saying why would I put up with something like this but ladies and I'm sure a lot of you know there are many many reasons why women put up with abuse And one of the reasons for this &nbsp;group is to bring out the points of why we put up with abuse recognize them understand the reasoning and put ourselves on a journey to healing there is more to my story and yes with a happy ending that I will talk about in our group meetings also this doesn't have to only be in groups one on one meetings are also available for women who are not comfortable yet talking in groups. For me the first step in &nbsp;recognizing abuse was to admit there was abuse and to believe that I am worth more then to be mistreated &nbsp;and to reach out for &nbsp;help and support&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>

They were saved by New Jersey\u2019s Governor Foster M. Voorhees, New York\u2019s Governor Theodore Roosevelt and the NJ State Federation of Women\u2019s Clubs. These visionaries had the foresight to preserve this truly remarkable gem of nature that was formed 200 million years ago. Today the Palisades are under yet another threat due to a few short sighted individuals that changed the previous 35 foot zoned building height in Englewood Cliffs, NJ to a towering 143 feet for LG Electronics Headquarters. This is a great injustice to the legacy of those that protected the Palisades and perhaps more importantly to the vast number of residents and tourists that enjoy the Palisades today. And what about future generations? What message does it send to our children when a few thoughtless individuals are allowed to abuse their authority to destroy a natural resource? Do we want our children to explain to their children how the Palisades once looked or do we want them to explain how their parents and grandparents helped protect the Palisades. We need to take a stand and say NO tower LG, build it lower!<br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>","lon":-73.9499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/2\/3\/4\/highres_368973332.jpeg","photo_id":368973332,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/2\/3\/4\/600_368973332.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/2\/3\/4\/thumb_368973332.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":9381858,"name":"Mike Gallo"},"members":195,"name":"Protect the Palisades","id":13862442,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Protect-the-Palisades","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Protectors of the Palisades"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Florham Park","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1397302682000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"referral-marketing","name":"Referral Marketing","id":16745},{"urlkey":"business-growth","name":"Business Growth","id":16838},{"urlkey":"business-referrals","name":"business referrals","id":57685},{"urlkey":"referral-networking","name":"Referral Networking","id":65618}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BNI-Networkers-Choice-Chapter-Florham-Park-NJ\/","rating":0,"description":"Looking for a way to grow your business?

For New Yorkers in the know, Skipping Club is a great source of fitness, a dose of joy in our week, a visceral way to get outside our comfort zones, an excuse to dress up, and a way to journey back to our youth. It's also a unique way to see the city and a faaaaaahbulous social outing. Every Thursday at 2 - and select happy hours, nights and weekends, Skipping Club skips a one-mile route, with intervals, exploring a new neighborhood around the city. From the Upper West Side and Central Park to Williamsburg, dive into a new theme - sartorially and spiritually. Enjoy curated music, improv-style games, meditations, urban adventures and a delicious hand-picked food and drink spot. Come skip, rediscover your playful innocence, paint the streets with joy, emit waves of positivity into the universe, and find your rhythm! I invite you to step into my imagination... and yours.","lon":-73.9300003052,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":65656202,"name":"Michelle Joni Lapidos"},"members":14,"name":"Michelle Joni's Skipping Club","id":13957042,"state":"NY","urlname":"Michelle-Jonis-Skipping-Club","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Skippers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Montclair","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1397737378000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"comedy","name":"Comedy","id":1001},{"urlkey":"standup","name":"Stand-Up Comedy","id":10225},{"urlkey":"comedy-clubs","name":"Comedy Clubs","id":43941},{"urlkey":"improv","name":"Improv","id":53513},{"urlkey":"comedy-club","name":"Comedy Club","id":88286},{"urlkey":"people-that-like-stand-up-comedy","name":"people that like stand up comedy","id":422202},{"urlkey":"stand-up-comedy-show","name":"Stand up comedy show","id":424002},{"urlkey":"comedy-show","name":"comedy show","id":424022}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/comedycraver\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>The Comedy Craver Meetup is open to lovers of comedy.

We hold our events in different places in central NJ, so don't pay too much attention to the listed group location!<\/p>\n<p>We focus on a form of energy healing known as Reiki. What is it? It is better understood when broken apart. Rei is universal Wisdom and Ki is life force energy. When put together, Reiki means Universal Life Force Energy that is Divinely Guided. What Divine means is completely up to you: Reiki carries no dogma and requires no specific way of thinking, so it is compatible with any religion or set of beliefs.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>When people practice Reiki, they put aside their ego and thoughts to act as a simple channel for the energy, the same way a wire allows electricity to pass through. Anyone and everyone can benefit from Reiki, as the energy helps regulate blocked or deficient Ki. Your Ki is affected by your state of mind and your day-to-day life, and energetic disturbances eventually cause illness and dis-ease. \u00a0Reiki practitioners help restore your body, mind, and spirit to the natural state of pure perfection.<\/p>\n<p>Reiki is a way to purify the holistic self, reduce stress and anxiety, and ultimately further one on his or her spiritual journey. Each person takes something different away from a session, because Reiki is always for your best and highest good. If you've never received it before, we encourage you to come to a share so that you can have a taste and see what it's all about.<\/p>\n<p>Come join other beautiful souls as we share, explore and unfold the magic of Reiki!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/njreikilove\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/njreikilove<\/a><br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-74.4300003052,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/b\/4\/highres_353782452.jpeg","photo_id":353782452,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/b\/4\/600_353782452.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/b\/4\/thumb_353782452.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":123272232,"name":"Lindsay Barber"},"members":129,"name":"Reiki Love New Jersey","id":13963922,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Reiki-Love-NJ","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.5,"who":"Beautiful Souls"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1397753633000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"nursing","name":"Nursing","id":385},{"urlkey":"registered-nurse","name":"REGISTERED NURSE","id":18933},{"urlkey":"licensed-vocational-nurse","name":"LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSE","id":18934},{"urlkey":"licensed-practical-nurse","name":"LICENSED PRACTICAL NURSE","id":18935},{"urlkey":"nursing-student","name":"Nursing Student","id":37195},{"urlkey":"nurses","name":"Nurses","id":55568},{"urlkey":"nurse-practitioners","name":"Nurse Practitioners","id":134860},{"urlkey":"nurses-network","name":"nurses network","id":151025},{"urlkey":"networking-for-nurses","name":"Networking for Nurses","id":154006}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Dedicated-Nurses-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This group is for nurses past, present and future who appreciate the devotion, hard work, caring, and especial rewarding nature of the career that is nursing.

By nature, for the past few years anyway, I've turned into a real worrier and pessimist, due to a few downturns in my life, so I thought I could use this class. Well, there was another bump in the road in my family life (my daughter lost her job) but instead of my typical hand-wringing, poor us, reaction, I felt a sense of anticipation and excitement for her...automatically, without trying. I feel I've been re-wired by Mark's weekly guidance and my subsequent daily practice. Would I say it's a miracle? \u00a0I think so...... The point is, it works. \u00a0Come join us and see for yourself. \u00a0Thank you, Mark.

Primordial voice is given to every single human. It is and intelligence on its own, the most amazing inbuilt guidance system, it is a healer within. PV is active in children up to the age of 3 years and can be activated during sexual experience, a serious illness or a form of mourning which is actually a healing vibration.<br>\n\nThrough Primordial Voice Technique you can reach untapped phenomenal abilities everyone possesses. These abilities are often hidden deep inside and accessed through the power of one\u2019s own Primordial Voice, a very powerful teaching allowing to re-recognize one\u2019s own strength.<\/p>\n<p>Primordial Voice teaches you to reach forgotten self confidence and live in agreement with your own true self. A grown-up person has 2 voices: a \u201cthinking\u201d voice which is active, and primordial one which is usually dormant. A \u201cthinking\u201d voice is a voice connected to the intellect that communicates the data registered by the brain. The vocal cords and muscles are used to produce a thinking brain. Primordial Voice is connected to the \u201cgut\u201d or \u201cheart\u201d , it is produced by trachea and smooth muscles that are connected to our subconscious mind. It communicates our inner wisdom, our inner guidance; it says, \u201cI lead you, I guide you\u201d.<br>\n\nKnowing your Primordial Voice and recognizing it is the most powerful tool to the secret of life, making the right choices, committing to the right situations, and interacting with the right people. Remember, you have spent many years trying to change yourself just to fit the general standards, to acquire qualities that are not yours and do not reflect your unique nature. The question is whether or not you have succeeded? And does your success set you free?<\/p>\n<p>Primordial Voice is not about changing or improving: it is about KNOWING yourself and living in accordance with your TRUE SELF.

A medium can attune to the Spirit people, and is able to describe them and relate their thoughts, emotions, memories, and messages. Mediumship is a natural gift of the Spirit and has many purposes: it brings comfort to the bereaved; it offers spiritual nourishment for the soul; it becomes a vehicle for God\u2019s Healing Spirit; and it demonstrates the potential of the individual to break through self-imposed limitation and, thus, become part of a Greater Whole.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>WHAT IS SPIRITUAL HEALING<\/b>?<br>\n\n An important part of of the Spiritualist experience is healing. Healers are simply channels for healing; the source of all healing is God. Our trained and designated healers direct healing light and energy according to each individual's needs. At every Sunday service during a period of meditation, we offer the opportunity to sit in one of our healing chairs for hands-on energy healing (given by a touch on your shoulders).<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>IS SPIRITUALISM A CHRISTIAN DENOMINATION?<\/b><br>\n\n Spiritualism is the vehicle through which all religions have been given birth. We embrace the teachings and example of Jesus of Nazareth. We consider Jesus a great prophet, medium and healer. His connection with the Divine was so strong that one could consider him as God's Presence on Earth. Was he the only such manifestation of God's Love and Grace? No. During times of spiritual crisis, God sends messengers of the Word to help guide us; Jesus, Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Krishna and Mohammed, to name a few. One can be Christian and a Spiritualist; one can be Jewish and a Spiritualist; one can be Buddhist and a Spiritualist; etc.<\/p>\n<p><b><br>\n\n SUNDAY SERVICE:<\/b><br>\n\n The highlight of our Church week is Sunday worship. Our worship service integrates music, prayer, healing, meditation, inspiration and Spirit communication into the beautiful and unique experience of Spiritualist worship. Each week our church invites a guest minister. Sunday service begins at 11:00 AM and ends at approximately 12:15 PM. You are cordially invited to join us in the Church Hall for coffee, refreshments and fellowship following the service. (Doors Open at 10:30 AM for Silent Prayer and Meditation).<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>The Typical Order of Service:<\/b><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Opening Song and Prayer<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Declaration of Principles<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Sermon \/ Sharing<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Healing Prayer and Meditation<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Laying-on-of-Hands Healing<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Offering<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Announcements<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Hymn<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Spirit Greetings (Mediumship)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Closing Song: \"Let There Be Peace on Earth\"<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>WORKSHOPS:<\/b><br>\n\n Our guest ministers and other spiritual practitioners provide workshops on various subjects relating to Spirituality, Mediumship Development, Psychic Development, Healing and much more.

Sounds good so far. Almost two thousand years earlier another also very sharp Greek dude named Aristotle wrote that not only is happiness the greatest good, it\u2019s the only end in life, everything else being just a means. Okay, that makes sense too.<\/p>\n<p>This group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n While we'll depart from them whenever and however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions:<\/p>\n<p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>2. Spend more time socializing<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>5. Stop worrying<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<\/p>\n<p>8. Become present oriented<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>10. Work on a healthy personality<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>11. Be yourself<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n Here's some background on the research our group is based on:<br>\n\n<br>\n\n In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Resources:<\/p>\n<p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free.

I formed this walk group for people who are new to the area (or old) or even considering moving into an area and would like to explore the different cool parts of the towns and cities along the Hudson. I always feel that people move into a specific area only after having probably zipped through the neighborhood sitting in a car. Well yes, one does get a \"vague\" idea of the place but do you really get to enjoy it? Then do you come back again and again to take in the flavour? Maybe, maybe not. So as a way to give back to the society I decided to form this meetup. Usually the walks will not be over bearing or long. However for your &amp; everyone else's enjoyment, you have to be physically fit to be walking and being on foot for at least an hour or more. To keep it interesting we can end the walk in an interesting place to eat or drink from time to time. Every meetup we'll be exploring different areas for Jersey City, Hoboken and West NewYork. If you want more cities to be added feel free to get in touch with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/6\/0\/600_358735392.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px\"><\/p>\n<p>*Members should understand and agree that they will be obligated to pay the bill for the food or drinks they have incase the meetup ends at a place of food or drinks.<\/p>\n<p>*As a member of this group you are not allowed to solicit other members for your products, business or services.

Together, we can practice staying grounded in the present moment by stopping, focusing on our breathing, and observing our thoughts and feelings without getting lost in them. By sitting and walking in this way, we can gain clarity, spaciousness and the ability to stay present to whatever arises without reacting habitually. By continually practicing with the support of community, our commitment to living mindfully is strengthened and our concentration deepens. There will be guided and silent sittings and a period of walking meditation, along with a reading and time to share and practice mindful speech and listening. The practice is influenced by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, Pema Chodron, and the teachers of the Insight Meditation tradition. There is a suggested donation of $10.

The UX Debate Club uses an Oxford-Style debate format to encourage everyone to participate while exchanging ideas, banishing dogma and having fun.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/7\/6\/highres_403281622.jpeg","photo_id":403281622,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/7\/6\/600_403281622.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/7\/6\/thumb_403281622.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13234574,"name":"Michael Calleia"},"members":146,"name":"UX Debate Club","id":14611582,"state":"NY","urlname":"UX-Debate-Club","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.6699981689,"who":"Debaters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1400839029000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"russian","name":"Russian Language","id":982},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"russians","name":"Russians","id":20978},{"urlkey":"russian-culture","name":"Russian Culture","id":28841},{"urlkey":"russian-professionals","name":"Russian Professionals","id":95073},{"urlkey":"russian-business-networking","name":"Russian Business Networking","id":133645}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/RussianBusinessClub\/","rating":4,"description":"Business Hacks + Chat + Drinks = Russian Business Club.

Hence stop fiddling with thoughts but learn how to control THE MIND directly<br>\n\nStage 2:<br>\n\nPurification of Mind at the inner abode of trijunction of Ingla, Pingla and Sushmana in the sound and light of Aum<\/p>\n<p>Stage 3:<br>\n\nLearning how to open the secret 10th door (Dasham Dwaar) through the experience of Kundalini Jagaran<\/p>\n<p>Stage 4:<br>\n\nAttaining Atma Sakshatkar (Self Realization), Experience of Cosmic Executor and Experience of Eternal Sadguru<\/p>\n<p>Stage 5:<br>\n\nRealization of Supreme Being and attaining Union<\/p>\n<p>Ever wondered how Ancient Sages and seers succeeded in controlling mind and awakening the dormant power of consciousness to realize the self as well as supreme being?

This Meetup was created in the hopes of having one central listing for all NYC history related events in the city. &nbsp; In a way this is more of calendar than it is a Meetup, but if people enjoy this resource then I would be down to create more social types of event. &nbsp;And if you do plan to go to an event feel free to RSVP and invite people for pre- or post- event hanging out.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; Also if you enjoy this resource and want to help out please feel free to contact me. &nbsp;I want to add events from as many sources as possible, but it might be a bit much for one man.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; Also a few disclaimers. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>&nbsp; One, I do own a sightseeing company for full disclosure, but I will mention which if any events are from my company. &nbsp;I don't think I'll list many at all or for a while.<\/span> <br> <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; Two, I will provide links to all the venues with the event posting. &nbsp;If you want to confirm that you will be able to join an event check there to see if it's been canceled or is sold out.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; Three, event hosts in this Meetup means that they manage the posting, not that they will actually be attending the event (unless they say otherwise.) &nbsp;If you are attending the event and want to let people know RSVP. &nbsp;If you would like to do something before or after the event let people know in the comments.<span>&nbsp; With that having been said here's the criteria for the events I list.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; 1) &nbsp;Must be New York City related in some way. &nbsp;Related being the key word. &nbsp;If there's a talk on the Dutch colonial period, but not specifically on New York I might throw it in the mix.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; 2) &nbsp;Must be history related in some significant way. &nbsp;Doesn't have to be all history based to qualify. &nbsp;A tour of the High Line that talks about the future plans of the site in addition to it's history is fine. &nbsp;An event that only talks about present or future events will not be added.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For the purposes of this Meetup I will say it will have to deal with events at least 20 years old to be \"historical\".<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; 3) &nbsp;Daily or weekly events will not (for the time being) be added to this Meetup to prevent clutter.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; Enjoy and please feel free to give me feedback.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; SOME PLACES WE CHECK FOR EVENTS:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; BROOKLYN BRAINERY \/ BROOKLYN HISTORICAL SOCIETY \/ BROOKLYN PUBLIC LIBRARY \/ MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK \/ NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF PARKS &amp;

Yet, its medical\/martial origin was gradually stripped from it by subsequent generations of practitioners, rendering a form that is definitely better than not doing any type of physical activity, yet not able to deliver all its unmeasurable potential.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, a difference must be made between this worldwide known style, and the original style that was passed down by Lu-Ch'an's other grandson, Yang Shou-hou, and preserved by the World Taiji Boxing Association, that will enable the serious practitioner to take advantage of all the benefits offered by the work of geniuses.

You just needed an upgrade to your toolset. PowerPivot provides that upgrade and then some. I would say that we probably needed a 50% upgrade to Excel, but what we got is more like a 500% upgrade; and that is not a number I throw around lightly. Imagine the year is 1910, and you are one of the world's first biplane pilots. One day at the airfield, someone magically appears and gives you a brand-new 2012 jet plane. You climb inside and discover that the cockpit has been designed to mimic the cockpit of your 1910 biplane! You receive a DRAMATIC upgrade to your aircraft without having to learn how to fly from scratch. That is the kind of 'gift' that PowerPivot provides to Excel Pros.\" The purpose of this Meetup is to explore this new \"toolset\" and push our Excel data-crunching prowess to the maximum. I would like to begin with the founding members, going chapter by chapter, as a group, through Rob Collie's book, \"DAX Formulas for PowerPivot, A Simple Guide to the Excel Revolution\". I imagine, that if the group grows, those founding members will then be well-versed enough to provide instruction and guidance to new groups members. This is a very exciting new technology, applied to the most ubiquitous business tool in the WORLD!!! I personally would say that this is the best thing to happen to Excel, since Excel!<\/p>","lon":-73.9499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/f\/2\/highres_371908402.jpeg","photo_id":371908402,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/f\/2\/600_371908402.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/f\/2\/thumb_371908402.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11897530,"name":"Jerid C.

Successful women don't come from working smarter or harder, they come from belonging to a global network of women, all dedicated to conducting business from the heart. As women we understand the true meaning of service and that gives us a great advantage in an economy where fortunes will be made by people serving other people. If you have the heart to help other woman and are open to the love and support that business women around the world can bring and if you have exhausted all of the traditional possibilities for earning success, please join us to open your heart and open your eyes and see the new business reality unfolding all around you. Expect to receive the respect you deserve for all the incredible service you've done for the people you love; to feel appreciated by other women who have also made great sacrifices and to meet women like you who began practicing our unique approach and they will become your mentors, coaches, your role models and, most importantly, your friends.","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":131040522,"name":"Polina Stolyar"},"members":49,"name":"GWEN-Global Women Entrepreneur Network-New York!","id":14912422,"state":"NY","urlname":"GLOBAL-WOMEN-ENTREPRENEUR-NETWORK-GWEN-of-NEW-YOUR-CITY","category":{"name":"women","id":35,"shortname":"women"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Global Women Entrepreneurs"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Paramus","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1402059215000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"homebrew","name":"Homebrewing","id":233},{"urlkey":"beer","name":"Beer","id":1475},{"urlkey":"home-brewing","name":"Home Brewing","id":24660},{"urlkey":"beer-making","name":"Beer Making","id":25454},{"urlkey":"craft-beer","name":"Craft Beer","id":28718},{"urlkey":"micro-brewed-beer","name":"Micro Brewed Beer","id":34913},{"urlkey":"beer-tasting","name":"Beer Tasting","id":44153},{"urlkey":"beer-lovers","name":"Beer Lovers","id":46593},{"urlkey":"home-brewers","name":"Home Brewers","id":70998},{"urlkey":"brewing","name":"Brewing","id":1166862}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bergen-County-Brew-Crew\/","rating":5,"description":"A Home Brewers club for people in Bergen County.

Hip hop rivals pop and country music as the most lucrative music forms in world. Spanish language radio and TV ratings out-perform its English language counterparts in many of the largest media markets. The NFL, MLB and NBA each have various ethnic and racial groups highly represented on the field or on the court.<\/p>\n<p>Yet the staffs and front offices of these venues, teams and promoters don't always reflect the diversity on the field, on the stage or in the stands. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tidesport.org\/RGRC\/2013\/2013_NBA_RGRC.pdf\">The Institute for Diversity and Inclusion in Sport reports<\/a> that the NBA's player population stands at 81 percent men of color yet only 7 percent of team CEOs are Black, Latino or Asian American. In music, three of the top-grossing concert artists are Jay Z, Beyonce and Bruno Mars but what percentage of the arena's sales and marketing staff are people of color? When working at a venue or with a promoter, how do you connect with industry colleagues and other resources to help you market and sell more tickets to diversity markets?<\/p>\n<p>Our group seeks to to do three, fun things to help:<\/p>\n<p>1. Network! We have a network of sports and entertainment sales, marketing, PR and venue operations professionals that would love to get together and network and make new connections. We also know lots of people would like to explore getting a job with a sports team or a art house venue but don't have the knowledge or the connections. We could be a fun group to learn more and make those connections.<\/p>\n<p>2. Attend Live Events &amp; Meet Insiders. We also look to schedule outings where we can to see a great show or sporting event but get something a little extra - like see a show then have an artist meet-and-greet or attend a sporting event and then meet current team employees to learn about the industry. There are lots of great opportunities for these kinds of outings throughout the NY\/NJ region.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n \u00a03. Have Fun! That's why we don't sell or market something boring, after all :) We hope you can join us for some fun outings with like-minded professionals.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/a\/highres_384661722.jpeg","photo_id":384661722,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/a\/600_384661722.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/a\/thumb_384661722.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3843797,"name":"Michael Collazo"},"members":23,"name":"Dahday's Live Sports & Entertainment Industry Insiders Group","id":14977012,"state":"NY","urlname":"Dahdays-Live-Sports-Entertainment-Industry-Insiders-Group","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Sports & Entertainment Insiders"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1402333158000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"cocktails","name":"Cocktails","id":10475},{"urlkey":"beach","name":"Beach","id":10567},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"summer","name":"Summer","id":98653}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Summer\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This group is for cool people who like it hot (and hot people who like the cool!), in their 20s and 30s looking to meet new friends.

Martin Luther King Jr said,\u201cSo let us be maladjusted, as maladjusted as the prophet Amos, who in the midst of the injustices of his day could cry out \u2018Let justice run down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream.\u2019 Let us be as maladjusted as Abraham Lincoln, who had the vision to see that this nation could not exist half slave and half free. Let us be maladjusted as Jesus of Nazareth, who could look into the eyes of the men and women of his generation and cry out, \u2018Love your enemies.\u2019\u201d And King was also not afraid to aspire to realize paradise on earth, to say to his followers even in times when it seemed that hope was doomed, \"I have been to the mountain top and I have seen the promised land, and I want you to know that we will get there.\" He did not say to compromise because look where compromise has gotten us today.

This is a mastermind group for people interested in the art and business of fiction writing. Our motto - \"when one boat rises, all boats rise.\"\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Below is some basic information. Please visit the various other sections of our site for more details.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b><br>\n\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Our Goals<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Ours is not your typical meetup group. Our primary focus is to help writers at all levels of development, to evolve and improve both their skills as a writer, and their knowledge\u00a0 and abilities in aspects of self-publishing. We do this by pursuing four goals.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Goal 1 - To Sharpen our writing skills through discussions of craft and technique, by performing fun group writing exercises, and by critiquing each others work in a structured format.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Goal 2 - To add to our knowledge of the\u00a0 craft and business of writing, through the selected readings of some of the best books on the market. Each month our group will read one book from a list of selected titles. What we learn from each book, will be the basis of our discussions as we share ideas and experiences, building on the material we've read.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Goal 3 - To explore the rapidly grow opportunities arising from the world of self-publishing through discussion and sharing of experiences and ideas. Building mailing lists, construction of marketing funnels, building product catalogs, calls to action, e-book pricing, hybrid publishing, paper print vs digital - all these subjects and more will be examined.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Goal 4 - To network with like minded writers, to share ideas, to encourage, to mastermind. Writing can be a lonely pursuit. It often helps to get together with those walking the same path as you. As the group grows and gets comfortable with each other, additional gatherings may be arranged, from an occasional get together over a few drinks or a cup of coffee, to going as a group to a writers conference (RWA 2015!).<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b><br>\n\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Who This Group Is For<\/b><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>This group is primarily for story tellers, writers of fiction and\u00a0memoirs. While all writers within these categories are welcome, it should be noted that this group will be especially geared towards the entrepreneur, the person(s) looking to write professionally, or at least make some supplemental income. Self-publishing will also have a strong focus, though we will also touch on traditional and hybrid publishing during the course of our journey. Existing professional writers are more than welcome (we will worship you accordingly), as are beginners and everyone in-between who have finally decided its time to pursue that dream.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>The group is length agnostic - short stories, novella's, novels, serials, all are welcome. The group is also genre agnostic. Whether your writing westerns, science fiction or romance, the crafting of story shares the same techniques and difficulties.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Which is Why ...<\/b><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Writing groups are notoriously tough to start and maintain on meetup.com. With your help, we're going to be different. While we appreciate you joining our little \"kickass\" group, \"just joining\" and three dollars will help pay for coffee. SHOWING UP to a meeting is what really counts! Come to a meeting. You will have fun, sharpen your skills and learn tons of valuable stuff.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><i>Lesson two - start with a call to action, then end with a call to action.

Socionics is similar to the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, only a lot more advanced to better explain personality type and inter-type relationships.<\/p>\n<p>Socionics is a personality typology developed in the 1970s and '80s by the Lithuanian researcher Dr. Au\u0161ra Augustinavi\u010di\u016bt\u0117. Socionics is based on Jung's personality type theory, Freud's theory of the conscious and unconscious, and Antoni Kepinski's theory of information metabolism. Since its inception, it has been developed by a variety of Russian researchers like Gulenko. The name \"socionics\" is derived from the word \"society\", because Augustinavi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 believed that each personality type has a distinct purpose in society, which can be described and explained by Socionics.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The most interesting part of Socionics is dedicated to the intertype relations research. Each personality type, according to Socionics, has a specific core relationship to each other personality type. The theory suggests that some personality types are more and the others are less psychologically compatible based on their personality differences. Socionics dating grows in popularity day by day as more people learn about this intertype relationship theory and gain valuable insights in their private and working relationships. This group is for people to learn and discuss Socionics for the purpose of self-typing and self-discovery, to find the right partner whether it is for a short or long term relationship, to improve their current social, familial, and romantic relationships, and most definitely to connect to other people who are interested in examining their lives and relationships through the Socionical lens.<\/p>\n<p>With this group, you'll be able to find out your Socionics type and learn more about your strengths, values and attitudes towards the world around you, and how you interact with those of different types.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To find out more about Socionics, check out our&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/worldsocionics.blogspot.co.uk\/2014\/07\/an-introduction-to-socionics-part-1.html\">Introduction to Socionics<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We also have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/967849579908590\/\">Facebook group<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to join our wider community at&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/worldsocionicssociety\">World Socionics Society<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Finally PLEASE support our meetup group by pledging a pound or two per month at our&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/WorldSocionics\">Patreon page.<\/a><\/p>","lon":-73.9499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/d\/4\/highres_440625268.jpeg","photo_id":440625268,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/d\/4\/600_440625268.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/d\/4\/thumb_440625268.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13538250,"name":"Jack Oliver Aaron"},"members":44,"name":"New York City Socionics Society","id":15436642,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYCSocionics","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.6500015259,"who":"Socionists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Staten Island","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1404226786000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Staten-Island-Friends\/","rating":4.9,"description":"<p><b>Looking to buy or sell property in Staten Island.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nhttp:\/\/www.robertlauracerquastatenislandrealty.com\/<\/b><br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-74.1800003052,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/0\/6\/highres_382031782.jpeg","photo_id":382031782,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/0\/6\/600_382031782.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/0\/6\/thumb_382031782.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14518799,"name":"Jason Verdera"},"members":459,"name":"!\"Staten Island Friends\"!","id":15437632,"state":"NY","urlname":"Staten-Island-Friends","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.5400009155,"who":"Friends"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Fanwood","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1404236330000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"reiki","name":"Reiki","id":1204},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"gentle-yoga","name":"Gentle Yoga","id":18960},{"urlkey":"reiki-share","name":"Reiki Share","id":20779},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"reiki-and-crystals","name":"Reiki and Crystals","id":36401},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"gongs-tibetan-singing-bowls-crystal-bowls","name":"Gongs.

We lean on each other, give advice and&nbsp;share connections.<\/p>\n<p>Here are&nbsp;6&nbsp;reasons why a&nbsp;mastermind might be right for you:<\/p>\n<p>1. You\u2019ll be part of an exclusive community. The other members need you just as much as you need them, so quality of experience and knowledge is crucial to all involved.<\/p>\n<p>2. Advisement. Once you are involved in a mastermind, that feeling of \u201cbeing alone\u201d is gone. The other members of the group turn into advisors of sorts and vice versa.<\/p>\n<p>3. Collaboration is the name of the game. You may find someone in the group that is a perfect fit to work on a project with you.&nbsp;Or, you may&nbsp;be the perfect person to help another member as well. The group works together collaboratively,&nbsp;to achieve more together.<\/p>\n<p>4. Joining a mastermind expands your network exponentially and rapidly. By joining a mastermind, you&nbsp;instantly add to your network and typically gain the networks of those in the group with you.<\/p>\n<p>5. New learning. Everyone in the mastermind is unique in skill, experience and connections.

What about that relationship? have you been asking yourself that question as well ?. That's many of us, we want to let go but just cant, we need to let go of that clutter (clothes, magazines, paper pile up, the 6 jars of jelly that have no place in your kitchen) Whatever it may be, learning to live with less especially stress will not just make you happy but will add years to your life. Join us so that we can learn from each other that it's ok to let go of your vintage Jordache jeans, well maybe not the vintage Jordache jeans, you cant find those anymore. But you dont need another pair just because their on sale and your pockets are full with store coupons.

We welcome those in various life stages (single, married, moms), as we believe that it will contribute to an interesting mix of members. Our events will include charity, arts, music, fashion, dining, cooking classes, trips, happy hours, ladies' nights, etc. We hope that through this group you will be able to develop a close-knit group of friends as well a network of women who will support you and help you navigate this big city. Tell your friends, invite others, they are welcome too!<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/3\/9\/c\/highres_386073692.jpeg","photo_id":386073692,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/3\/9\/c\/600_386073692.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/3\/9\/c\/thumb_386073692.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":9211788,"name":"Mediastar"},"members":199,"name":"African Women of NYC","id":15532272,"state":"NY","urlname":"Young-African-Women-of-NYC","category":{"name":"language\/ethnic identity","id":16,"shortname":"language"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"African Women"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1404707138000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"divorcesupport","name":"Divorce Support","id":1570},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"newly-divorced","name":"Newly Divorced","id":16687},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"divorced-parents","name":"Divorced Parents","id":24314},{"urlkey":"social-networking-for-divorced-people","name":"Social Networking for Divorced People","id":31846},{"urlkey":"rebuilding-your-life-after-divorce","name":"Rebuilding Your Life After Divorce","id":36423},{"urlkey":"divorced-women","name":"Divorced Women","id":49572}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Divorce-Night\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Divorce Night is an invite only community of sophisticated and affluent divorcees who work hard and like to play even harder.

I started this group because I've met so many stay at home moms but not so many working moms in Astoria. All neighborhoods are welcome of course! We can chat, text, call, Skype and all share our stories. Together we can set up play dates, plan fun activities for our children and also for ourselves.

Cyclist or Paddler or neither. Come learn and try in tiny successful fun bits. Most of all we want you to experience the full door to door round trip motor experience. We came from 11 years of USA Cycle road racing 20 years of NYC Club Rising and now 3 years of SUP paddling on all local water ways. We provide certified instruction in both activities.
