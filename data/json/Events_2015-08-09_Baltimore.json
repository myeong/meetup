Great day for a doggy walk around the lake :)  .</p> <p><b><i>Please look carefully at the instructions and map below to find out where to park and meet for the walk!</i></b></p> <p><b>Lake Kittamaqundi,</b> the downtown heart of Columbia. For many years, the path only went only part-way around the lake. But this fall, the Columbia Association completed the circuit and we can now walk around the entire lake along a new paved path!</p> <p>This walk is very flat, only one gentle hill, and 1.5 miles around. We'll pass by the People Tree, the lakefront stage, and long-established Columbia restaurants like Clyde's and Tomato Palace.</p> <p><br/>You will basically head for the new <b>Whole Foods</b> of Columbia (added in Fall 2014), across from the Columbia Mall. However, we will park and meet in the <b><i>lower lot, down the hill,</i></b> and to the right of Whole Foods (as you look at it from the front.) This is actually the parking lot for the new <b>Haven on the Lake</b> spa. Please park in the area <i>furthest from the spa entrance</i>, as shown on the map below, so that we are closest to the trail and won't get in the way of the spa clients.</p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/c/1/3/600_432875859.jpeg\" /></p> <p>SAFETY &amp; COURTESY</p> <p>Please arrive early, to allow the dogs time to sniff and form their pack. We will <b>leave on time.</b>  If you can't make it please change your RSVP promptly, or leave a comment.  We'll turn to the right on the trail (counter clockwise) so you'll know where to find us if you arrive late.  </p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/1/1/d/600_438477629.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/f/a/f/600_436040399.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Please bring water for yourself &amp; your dogs.  We're trying to avoid sharing water on the trail to prevent the chance of spreading the New Dog Flu.<br/></b></p> <p><b>If you see joggers or bikers, please shout \"ON YOUR LEFT\" to keep the dogs safe from being trampled, and to protect others from tripping on our animals.</b></p> <p>PLEASE READ:</p> <p>Columbia Dogs on the Go provides a way for friendly people with friendly dogs to meet people with similar interests on a voluntary basis. By replying \"Yes\" to this RSVP and attending this event, you acknowledge that: </p> <p>•  You are responsible for your own safety and the safety of your dogs and any guests. </p> <p>•  Your dogs are current on their vaccinations.</p> <p>•  Your dogs will be kept on a 6-foot fixed leash (<b>non-retractable</b>) and under your control at the Meetup.</p> <p>•  You will clean up after your dogs at the Meetup.</p> <p>•  You will update your RSVP if your plans change.</p> <p>•  You understand that the <i>Meetup ends when the walk ends</i>.

We're a friendly, but very focused group of writers who go in-depth to critique the works we bring in. We never get personal, but we will provide deep, honest feedback. We've had many stories workshopped here published professionally, and our goal is to keep that happening by making stories as strong and sharp as they can be. If you're going to present, bring 6 to 8 copies of a piece up to 2,500 words. For those with longer works, serialization is common. Of course, anyone who just wants to sit in, not present, and talk writing with us, is more than welcome to come by and do just that.</p>",

Drinking Skeptically provides an opportunity for skeptics to talk, share ideas (and yes, drink) in a casual, relaxed atmosphere. We discuss the issues of the day and whatever else is on our minds. But most of all, we have fun while promoting skepticism, science, and rationality. Don't drink? Don't let that stop you from joining us! Some of the world's most famous skeptics are teetotallers, and we are happy to have you! Remember that drinking skeptically means drinking responsibly. If there's one thing science has taught us, it's the effects of alcohol on the human body.

Many who attended took home eggs and larvae to raise at home. This month it's time to meet again so we can swap stories and moths.  Those who ended up with females--come and get a male.  Those who ended up with males--come and get a female.  Several people will be on hand to talk about the life cycle of Lunas, as well as other moths found around Maryland.  If you missed last month's meeting, join us.  There will be plenty to learn, and you can take home a cocoon, egg, or larva to raise at home.</p> <p>Nick will bring lots of Polyphemus moths in their first instar (growth stage).  If you would like to take one home, find a good source of ash, birch, grape, hickory, maple, oak, or pine.  If you would like to raise Lunas, find a good source of sweet gum or Black Walnut.  Bring a clipping with you along with a container. (If you don't know how to identify these trees, I will be posting a picture of sweet gum soon. Perhaps someone can add a picture of the other trees as well? We will also bring examples to the meeting.) We will show you how to set them up, and what to expect in the coming weeks. You will need a five-gallon (or larger) aquarium with a tight-fitting screen on top, or something similar to house them once you get home.</p> <p>Even if you don't want to raise these little guys and gals, come out and enjoy an evening of learning about Maryland moths.</p> <p>This will be an informal meeting. Be prepared to ask questions and go with the flow of the evening.</p> <p>Cost: FREE</p>",

Reiki practitioners of all levels of training, as well as all lineages, often enjoy the opportunity to participate in communal Reiki sessions known as Reiki Shares or Reiki Circles. The sessions give each person a chance to learn from one another as practitioners, as well as benefiting from multiple healing hands during the sessions. At this event we will take turns performing and receiving Reiki. Those that are not Reiki practitioners will be pared up with experienced Reiki practitioners. This is a fun event to be enjoyed by all. Please let me know in your response if you are new to Reiki or a practitioner of some level.

She locks her huge brown eyes with a client’s and asks directly, but respectfully, “Do you really need this? Why? How does it make you feel when I take it away?” And very occasionally, when a person seems unreasonably attached to a shopping bag of old birthday cards or an ugly ashtray pilfered from a restaurant in Greece, she pulls out the tough love: “Are you going to give me trouble with this?” </p> <p>As the host of the Discovery Home Channel’s hit show Neat, Buttigieg provides clutter control and guidance to a new household every week. She’s something between an organizer and a headshrinker, with certifications as a professional organizer and as a life coach. She simultaneously cleans out closets while slowly uncovering subconscious “blocks” that make a person want to hoard junk or prevent them from putting their dirty clothes in the hamper. </p> <p>Her gentle leadership made a lifelong fan out of client Denise Fujiwara, who says Buttigieg “is a living example of what you can do with an affirmative attitude.” The Toronto-based choreographer was lost trying to sort out her home office to make room for a house renovation when she called in Buttigieg to help. As someone who runs her own choreography business and dance troupe, Fujiwara’s office is prone to clutter. “My office was a horrendous mess,” she says. She describes stacks of boxes, piles of unfiled papers, photographs, video tapes, press releases – essentially 15 years’ worth of disorder and confusion. </p> <p>“I’d tried to sort it out in the past, but I hadn’t had the skills to do it properly until I worked with Hellen. In about 6 hours, she did what I couldn’t do in 15 years,” she says. </p> <p>The two went around the room in an orderly way, starting at the door and working clockwise. “Occasionally, I’d get stuck on something, and she’d push me to make a decision,” says Fujiwara. “She pushed through, and in the end I felt euphoric to be relieved of all that stuff.” </p> <p>Buttigieg unloads stuff with a dancer’s grace and a politician’s diplomacy. Anyone would think she was born taking charge of people’s unruly environs, teaching them how to be better organized. In a way, that’s true. She says she was always organized, even as a teenager, when most kids live among piles of laundry, music collections and notebooks. She was also always a confident speaker. In grammar school, she was the girl who narrated the school plays. </p> <p>In fact, Buttigieg moves and speaks so naturally in front of the camera and with such calm assertiveness, no one would guess that not long ago she was at a loss for what to do with her life. </p> <p>“I had been out of the workforce for almost 10 years as a stay-at-home mom, but I lacked confidence, and I didn’t know what to do,” she says from her home in Oakville, a suburb of Toronto, Canada. </p> <p>She graduated from Seneca College in Toronto with a degree in radio and television broadcasting, and worked briefly as an administrator and fitness instructor. But then she had two children and took off nearly 10 years from work to raise them. Those 10 years at home had slowly whittled away her confidence as a businessperson, but she still wanted to launch a new career – and have some adult conversation. Her solution? In 1999, she joined City Centre Toastmasters. </p> <p>“Toastmasters changed my life,” she says. </p> <p>She means that in the most literal sense. It started with one of the first lessons any new Toastmaster learns: talk about what you know. Buttigieg started writing speeches about what she knew, and as someone who was naturally neat, she talked about organizing. And then at one contest she gave a speech called “Simple Simon” about simplifying your life by letting go of clutter, and it launched a new career. </p> <p>“Giving speeches is a journey of self-discovery,” she says. “How often in life do people really listen to us? At Toastmasters, people are truly listening; they’re not thinking about what they’ll say back. It’s a safe place to speak, so I could use my speeches to work out what resonated with the audience.” </p> <p>And also what resonated with her. That speech was the nugget that now sits at the center of her professional life. In fact, she still uses parts of the same speech today when she gives presentations: “If you would like to get a taste of the simple life, don’t let stuff complicate it. Commit to following these three simple steps: If you don’t use it, lose it; if you don’t need it, don’t buy it; and when you bring one item in, take one item out.” </p> <p>This would become her mantra in several ways. It sparked her desire to become a life coach and also tapped into her abilities as an organizer. Starting her own organizing business, called WeOrganizeU, helped pay for the life-coaching certification. Soon, a group of producers approached her about a new show that would blend her gifts for tidying up with her ability to lead people, and by 2004 Neat hit the North American airwaves. </p> <p>Buttigieg credits Toastmasters with more than just sparking a good idea; she also says she honed her skills as a leader and built confidence. Shalini Alleluia, president of City Centre Toastmasters, says Buttigieg faced a short learning curve thanks to her take-charge attitude. </p> <p>“Hellen had lots of energy and was articulate and vibrant,” Alleluia says. “She always smiled and was willing to try anything.” </p> <p>Alleluia says even though Buttigieg was a new member, she asked her to chair a speech contest and encouraged her to assume meeting roles. Soon Buttigieg was helping others to be better speakers. </p> <p>“I think Hellen was more of a mentor to other people than other people being a mentor to her,” Alleluia says. “She has a charisma that makes people want to follow her and to be like her in personality and capability. She’s a good listener, and she always pays attention to the evaluation notes. I once told her she was very loud and didn’t have expression in her delivery, and she really listened.” </p> <p>Like any good Toastmaster, Buttigieg is still seeking advice on how to improve. She still asks Alleluia for feedback on her presentations and episodes of the TV show. “I’m honest, and I’ll tell her what I thought the show lacked or what I learned,” says Alleluia. </p> <p>While Alleluia coaches Buttigieg to improve some public speaking skills, her student is working toward a broader purpose. “I’m a teacher,” she says. “I feel that whether I’m organizing or coaching or speaking, there’s still that element of wanting to pass on the information I know to improve other people’s lives.” </p> <p>\n\n\n\n\nRead The Toastmaster on Your iPad!</p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://www.toastmasters.org/iPadMag\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.toastmasters.org/iPadMag</a> Access the Toastmasters International iPad® app by following these steps:</p> <p>1.

The larger neighborhoods of Baltimore host weekly outdoor movies and the best part is they are FREE. Let's pack some snacks and relax on the hill to watch a classic summer flick - Jaws!</p> <p>The movie starts at 9pm but I plan to arrive around 8:15pm at the latest to score a good spot. I will post to this event thread once I'm there so we have a meeting spot.</p> <p>Bring a blanket and whatever snacks you'd like! :)</p>",

Expect to paddle about 13 miles. We should return to Jonas Green before 4:00 PM.</p> <p>This is not a beginner paddle. We may encounter challenging conditions on the bay so you must have the skills and kayak appropriate for such conditions. You should be able to maintain a 3.5-mph pace and be comfortable paddling in choppy conditions. You must wear a sprayskirt and be able to perform a wet exit. Your kayak must be at least 14 feet long with sealed bulkheads. Contact me (Ben) if you have any questions.</p> <p>On this and other CKA paddles you are required to wear a PFD and bring a whistle.

Don’t overestimate your skills and abilities. Take instructional courses to learn about paddling technique, safety, self-rescue and hypothermia. Be aware of the tides, currents and weather conditions that will affect your safety on the days you paddle. Cooperate with group organizers, leaders and other members to insure your own safety as well as the safety of others and make it the fun, enjoyable day on the water it should be.</p>",

We should have plenty of time to load kayaks and relax before the drive up to St Mary’s City.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.smcm.edu/riverconcert/\"><a href=\"http://www.smcm.edu/riverconcert/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.smcm.edu/riverconcert/</a></a></p> <p>Some of us are planning on camping at Point Lookout State Park for the weekend.  There are a few of us planning on attending the St Mary's Paddle on Friday, the concert on Friday night,  Jake's Tiki Paddle at Solomon's Island on Saturday or a paddle around Point Lookout, and the Mallows Bay on Sunday.  This isn't a formal camping trip.  We will just all try to camp together and have a good time.  As of now I have sites reserved for us already in the Greens Point loop sites.  This year we opted for the the more expensive electric sites because they are near the water and there aren't as many bitey insects there!  We can put 2-3 tents on each site.  We might have to park some cars at the overflow site.  I may decide to go down Thursday night, earlier, if others are interested.  Price per person will be based on the number of people per site.  It should be about $15 per person per night.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Like clockwork, the 2nd Friday of each month, same time, same place (at the Park Heights Community Health Alliance).  </p> <p>By popular demand, we’ll use the same format as before:  a documentary video excerpt edited down to the best 20 minutes (which documentary? - it’s a surprise!).  Followed by a short educational presentation by Yours Truly, Dr. Joe (please call me “Joe”). </p> <p>By the time this event rolls around we will have announced the dates for our new TWICE-a-month in-person meeting schedule!   AS WELL AS a new series of conference calls, several per month, to keep in touch with one another and provide tips, tricks, help and support for those who want it.   We’ll include everyone who wants to talk by phone by scheduling as many conference calls as needed.  Stay tuned for details!     </p> <p>By this time I expect some people will have started checking their “dry weight”  (weighing in the morning before getting dressed, and after emptying the bladder, for a highly reproducible measurement).   For those who want to share their progress this way - either confidentially with the organizer, with the whole group, (or not at all), we know that monitoring your progress in this way HELPS with weight loss!  </p> <p>BTW, We found bathroom scales for $16 with free shipping (to those with an Amazon Prime account; I have one);  we’ll make those available, along with some other time-saving kitchen devices.  </p> <p>(FYI, this meetup is Not JUST for people who want to lose weight). </p> <p>At the last few meetings there have been more and more enthusiastic Beginners, a trend I expect will continue.  Local health providers are getting the word and referring more of their patients.  These new folks don’t quite know what to expect, have never really tried a plant-based diet, let alone healthy food in some cases.  But they’re enthusiastic and motivated to address their diabetes, obesity, cholesterol, hypertension, etc. etc. - and They've Come To The Right Place!</p> <p>These folks mix it up with others who are a little more experienced with preparing DELICIOUS, easy healthy food.  This way, we get a great dialogue, and some coaching, going on. </p> <p>All are encouraged to contact me for questions, help or support at[masked], or joeadamsmd [at] gmail.com).   Many other participants want to serve as coaches as well.   </p> <p>Wherever you are in the spectrum of lifestyle change, novice or expert, this will be a fun, educational, and rewarding experience - and it might save your life.</p> <p>Please bring along friends or family if you like. </p> <p>It is not mandatory to bring a dish to share, but we encourage it if you can, so we’ll be sure to have enough food for everyone.  (We always have).   If you’re new to this kind of cooking, or if it would be inconvenient for you to bring food, then just bring yourself.   If you do bring something, it must be vegan (free of meat, fish, fowl, eggs or dairy), and should not have a whole lot (if any) salt, oil or sugar.   If you bring something, please bring a piece of paper with your name (so we can ask for the recipe) and a list of ingredients.</p> <p>NOTE:  Last meeting I passed around copies of  “Joe’s Favorite Go To Quick Meals”  which you can find in the Meetup page (<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Nutrition-As-Medicine-Potluck/\"><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Nutrition-As-Medicine-Potluck/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Nutrition-As-Medicine-Potluck/</a></a>) under ‘More’     then    ‘Files.’   These are a dozen of some of my favorite recipes that I have almost EVERY WEEK  . . . because they’re Easy and Delicious!    If any of them are not exciting enough for you at first, you can always add some nuts, sliced avocado, sweet Hoisin sauce, soy sauce, raisins, or even some store-bought Chow Mein Noodles (which are not healthy in any way, but they do make food taste great).   Heck, you could even add some olive oil if you must.   I think the recipes taste amazing as-is, but there’s no accounting for taste - and my tastes have already adapted to healthy whole-food.</p> <p>Everything is free of charge, and there’s nothing to sell.  We’re passionate about helping others, and we get a lot out of it as well.  </p> <p>I hope you'll join us!  </p>",

      "description": "<p>If you feel like crossing the bridge.... Every Friday we play on sand courts. It is an established group so I will post here in case a couple of you can make it sometime. We usually get anywhere from 12-24 people show up, so don't worry if you only see a couple people RSVP here, there will be a lot of people there!  It is relaxed and a mix of skill levels, but pretty good games with great volleys. The courts are at the end of the second entrance to the park, past the baseball fields.</p> <p>Sometimes the location changes to an indoor court, I will update here if it changes. The second location is at Safe Harbor Church at 931 Love Point Road, Stevensville. The gym is in the back of the church, with it's own entrance.  I am not in charge of this event so it is not up to me to decide where we play, but I will inform everyone when and if it does!</p>",

We can arrange carpooling as always but you must contact me at least 2 days before we leave as I must also coordinate food. The cabin has a full kitchen and bathroom with 12 bunk beds, but you will need to bring your sleeping bag or tent if you want to camp. Red Creek beckons again so we can finish our work in for the year and close out the summer with a bang! This is cross-posted from the Washington Backpackers Meetup Group. Directions are the same as the July 9, 2010 trip. Hiking will be moderate, but we can always go to more places if we finish early.

Over the course of their marriage as Stephen's body collapsed and his academic renown soared, fault lines were exposed that tested the lineaments of their relationship and dramatically altered the course of both of their lives.\"</p> <p>The film won an Oscar for Best Motion Picture.  Eddie Redmayne won both an Oscar and a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in A Leading Role for his portrayal of Hawking.  </p>",

I would like to stress that everyone be there as early as possible. Please let me or Paul know if you are coming a little late but we might leave you if you don't. </p> <p>This is the event of the summer you have all been waiting for! We will have several boats rafting up with lots of others at Hart-Miller island for the Waterworx 15 Island Party. There will be a party barge with Rome Blackwell aka DJ Rome playing the hottest music to heat us up while the water cools us down!</p> <p>Bring some food and drinks (no red drinks like wine, sangria or daiquiris will be allowed on the boats). There will be a charge of $40 to cover fuel for the boats.</p>",

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:</p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.</p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.</p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.</p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.</p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car/on land.</p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.</p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun! More information can be found at &lt;a&gt;www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com.&lt;/a&gt; Hope to see you there!</p>",

Everything we make is sold in our store or by mail order. To the best of our knowledge, there are only six factories besides us that still twist pretzels by hand.]  Bring a bungee for some souvies!</p> <p><br/><b>We will follow the tour up with a lunch stop and then return.  We should return around 4pm give/take.  LET'S ROLL!!</b></p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/0/9/0/600_416672912.jpeg\" /></p>",

It is designed to capture water from a 1” rain storm and is planted in low spots in your yard to absorb and filter the water then slowly filter it back into the ground. Rain Gardens are planted with beautiful, native flowers, grasses and even trees that will beautify your yard while reducing stormwater impacts. They also provide habitat for wildlife, beneficial insects such as lady bugs, and pollinators like butterflies. You can learn more about them, help to plant one, and find out more about how GVC can help you with your own installation at this Rain Garden Workshop at Wilson Point!</p>",

Join us for a fun filled morning where we will continue to introduce Coder Dojo to the parents and the kids and gain an understanding fro group needs. </p> <p>For this event, we will plan to hold two group sessions - one is for those newer to programming and it is intended to re-introduce and build off of some of the basic elements the kids learned in the first session. </p> <p><br/>The second group will be focused on supporting growth for more experienced coders and we will continue to push forward on some of the projects the group outlined at our last event.</p> <p>If you missed the first meeting, please know that you can join in any time and we will always work to help ensure your child gets up to speed and feels included.  </p> <p>\n\n\n\nSome light food and drinks will be provided. While we will have a few extra laptops available, <b>we do ask that the kids come with a laptop</b> for this initial event. </p> <p><b>Interested in helping?</b> Just let us know as mentors and volunteers are always needed and welcome (older kids are welcome to join and help as a mentor or volunteer)</p> <p><i>Thank you to ReefPoint Group (<a href=\"http://www.reefpointgroup.com/\">www.reefpointgroup.com/</a>) for volunteering their beautiful space and support as we get this group off the ground.</i></p> <p>If you have any questions, please contact David Blackburn at<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]</a> or Dave Gilinson at <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]</a></p>",

But Kimmie will have boats available to rent.  Sign up quickly, because Chuck will have rentals at both sites and they will go fast!!!!</p> <p><br/>We're at that time of year where weather changes rapidly anywhere near the Chesapeake Bay.  We will do our best to plan paddle options that take everyone's skill level into account but depending on the weather you probably should be willing to deal with a little chop.</p> <p>We will meet at Point Lookout State Park boat launch for a 10:30 AM on the water time, or you can stop by our camp sites at Greens Point Loop sites 94.  Yes, we are camping.  If interested, please let Kimmie know so she can make sure she gets enough sites.  We are camping and paddling Friday, Saturday, and Sunday!</p> <p>The boat launch is past the causeway on the right hand side. It is a soft beach launch site. There are bathroom facilities available and a small park store on site.</p> <p>We will explore Canoy Lake and then into Hall Pond. There is a small bridge to go under and then on to a nice beach area take a break. We will then return towards the boat launch. If the weather and winds are favorable we will then paddle out the lake into the Potomac River and along the beach to the Point Lookout Lighthouse.</p> <p>We should be on the water at least 3-4 hours, but we will make final plans on that day based on weather and activities.</p> <p>The kayak rental cost for this event is $55.00.  Members who have paid the voluntary annual dues receive  a $5.00 discount on all kayak rentals.  Please be sure to answer the rental question when you RSVP to reserve a boat.</p> <p><br/>Again, if you are interested in camping, let Kimmie know!</p>",

Diplomacy differs from the majority of war games in several ways:</p> <p>-Players do not take one turn each, instead all players secretly write down their moves after a negotiation period, and then all moves are revealed and put into effect simultaneously.</p> <p>-Social interaction and interpersonal skills make up an essential part of the game's play.</p> <p>-The rules that simulate combat are strategic, abstract, and simple—not tactical, realistic, or complex—as this is a diplomatic simulation game, not a military one.</p> <p>-Combat resolution contains no random elements — no dice are rolled, no cards are drawn.</p> <p>We have to have 7 players to play this game. The 7 players are firm so if you are not sure if you will be able to attend please RSVP No as soon as possible.

An orca whale captured in 1970 off the coast of Washington State, Lolita is the sole survivor out of six young orcas captured and ripped away from their families that day. Lolita is currently captive at the Miami Seaquarium. Activists are fighting for Lolita's release and reunion with her mother and extended family, who still live freely. The recent news that the Miami Seaquarium will be sold to Palace Entertainment opens up new questions about Lolita's future. Join us to hear Lolita's story. We're thrilled to announce that Tim Gorski, the film's Director, will join us for Q &amp; A following the screening! Mr. Gorski may join us remotely, or perhaps in person!</p>",

Catch Me If You Can is a high-flying criminal caper based on the hit DreamWorks film and the incredible true story that inspired it. </p> <p>A teenager named Frank W. Abagnale, Jr. runs away from home in search of a glamorous life. With nothing more than his boyish charm, a big imagination, and millions of dollars in forged checks, Frank successfully poses as a pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer—living the high life and winning the girl of his dreams. But when this globe-trotting con artist catches the attention of FBI agent Carl Hanratty, Carl pursues Frank across the country. Along the way, the two forge an unlikely friendship and discover a surprising way to work together. </p> <p>Filled with jazzy music, high-energy dance numbers, and a riveting story, this big, bright new musical was created by a Tony Award-winning “dream team”, with a book by Terrence McNally (The Full Monty, Ragtime) and a swinging score by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman (Hairspray).</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/b/f/d/600_438135357.jpeg\" /></p>",

The ride starts at Harford and Argonne (where the side road goes down to the playground) at 6:20 am. They are usually punctual on the time. It is a fast casual ride - strong riders, but not racers and some are on hybrids or cyclocross. It loops the city, going through major parks for about 28 miles, stopping in South Baltimore for a break. It finishes around 9:00 am at Lake Montebello. Many people will hook up on the ride at different areas of the City - either 39th and Greenmount, or Druid Hill Park by the Conservatory: <a href=\"http://baltimore.about.com/od/parks/ss/druidhillconsv.htm\" class=\"linkified\">http://baltimore.about.com/od/parks/ss/druidhillconsv.htm</a></p>",

The details of the crime are slow to surface because Geraldine Coutts is traumatized and reluctant to relive or reveal what happened, either to the police or to her husband, Bazil, and thirteen-year-old son, Joe. In one day, Joe's life is irrevocably transformed. He tries to heal his mother, but she will not leave her bed and slips into an abyss of solitude. Increasingly alone, Joe finds himself thrust prematurely into an adult world for which he is ill prepared.</p> <p>While his father, a tribal judge, endeavors to wrest justice from a situation that defies his efforts, Joe becomes frustrated with the official investigation and sets out with his trusted friends, Cappy, Zack, and Angus, to get some answers of his own. Their quest takes them first to the Round House, a sacred space and place of worship for the Ojibwe. And this is only the beginning.\"</p>",

      "description": "<p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/2/6/e/event_139181582.jpeg\" /></p> <p>One of the best kept secrets here just north of Towson is the public access to a \"protected\" area of Loch Raven Reservoir park on the weekend.  On both Saturday and Sunday, park police close off Loch Raven Drive (some maps call it Loch Raven Rd.) between Morgan Mill Road and Providence Road. The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.  In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.  The views of the water and the surrounding wooded areas are wonderful all year round.</p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.</p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.</p> <p> <b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.</b></p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.</p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation/Landing/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years) is located.  Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!</b> Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.</p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.</p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.  We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy/rock. </p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/7/8/8/event_139178792.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Loch Raven Drive is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.  That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.  However, I am not aware of any sanctioned, prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.  It would be free style.</p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.</b></p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\". That way, we know not to be waiting for you. Thanks.</b></p> <p>So come join us on Sunday for a brisk walk in the park. It's a great way to clean out the cobwebs and start a Sunday.</p>",

Picking up stitches?After discussions last Sunday, we decided that this coming Sunday we will discuss sock issues and problems. Bring your unfinished socks that need attention! If you want to learn the magic loop, bring a circular needle that is at least 30\" or longer. [The magic loop allows you to knit in the round with any size project, no matter how small.]If you have kitchener stitch questions, I recommend watching this video.</p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://www.knittinghelp.com/video/play/kitchener-stitch\"><a href=\"http://www.knittinghelp.com/video/play/kitchener-stitch\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.knittinghelp.com/video/play/kitchener-stitch</a></a></p> <p><br/>On Sunday, bring something you can use for practice.Other than turning the heel, many of these techniques are used for making gloves, mittens, hats, fingerless gloves, infinity scarves and other projects.</p> <p>New to knitting? Want to learn? Want to crochet instead? Just want to network? All are welcome!</p> <p>WE MEET EVERY SUNDAY AT PANERA.</p>",

Or $75 seasonal per car, good for all state parks. 5120 South Street, Baltimore, MD 21227 GPS gets you to the park entrance. After turning in the park entrance, please pay the entrance fee at the booth. Continue straight ahead (for about 1.5 miles) and when you reach the intersection, take a LEFT (there is not an option to go forward, you can only turn LEFT or right). Follow the road TWO MILES to the  parking lot at the end of the road past the swinging bridge .

      "description": "<p>A documentary on the late singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse, who died of alcohol poisoning in 2011.</p> <p>Talking to Asif Kapadia can feel like talking to an obsessive; someone so fascinated by one thing that they have not only consumed all they could about their subject, but sworn to preserve the truth about them, too. That subject is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/amywinehouse\">Amy Winehouse</a>. That truth is the complicated conjunction of circumstance and agency that led the singer to die from alcohol intoxication at the age of 27.</p> <p>“There’s a point in the process where you can start correcting your interviewees because you know the story now. I know it,” he says. “I know when someone’s telling me something true and when they’re making it up. I know when they’re putting themselves in her life. Or, I’ll start saying to people who say they met Amy: ‘I don’t think you really met Amy. The person you describe, that’s not <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/amy\">Amy</a>, by that point she’d changed and I don’t know what you’re talking about.’”</p> <p>A 43-year-old Londoner, Kapadia is the man behind Amy, a documentary that chronicles Winehouse’s tragic decline from bright-eyed prodigy to doomed tabloid obsession. Assembled from 100 interviews and incorporating 20 months of editing in a process that took three years in total, the film presents what feels like a true version of events. It is also incredibly moving.</p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/A97-pQJD6Hw\" class=\"embedded\">https://youtu.be/A97-pQJD6Hw</a></p>",

      "description": "<p>It's great to get outside and explore the natural world.  Why not keep track of what you find? Field Journals are notebooks where you record observations and then share what you've seen with other people.  Field Journals can include words, sketches, questions about what you see, and your thoughts about how your environment changes over time. They are tools that can help you better understand nature and yourself!</p> <p>You don't need to be an artist or an expert to start keeping a field journal. During this trip, we'll head outdoors to Marshy Point Park to observe and track those observations in a journal.  If you're new to field journaling, Martha can offer guidance.  If you are experienced with keeping a field journal, that's fine. This is a chance to learn from other journal-keepers and expand your materials and methods.  </p> <p><b>When: </b>Sunday, July 12th, 1 - 4 pm      </p> <p><b>Raindate</b>: Sunday, July 26th.</p> <p><b>Location</b>: Marshy Point Park (We'll try a different trail from our last trip.)</p> <p><b>Bring: </b>Something to write with, and something to write on.  Nothing fancy. You're welcome to bring other art materials.</p> <p><b>Dress: </b>Dress for the weather.  Wear a hat for the sun and bring water to drink. Bring sunsreen and insect repellent if you need them.</p> <p><b>Cost:</b> $10 </p> <p>Martha is a volunteer, so your money for these sessions will go directly to support the programs, the nature collections, and the building that make this kind of nature education possible.  Please consider becoming a member of the Natural History Society of Maryland by visiting &lt;a&gt;www.marylandnature.org.&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p><b>The instructor: </b> Martha Stauss is a Senior Engineer specializing in GIS and Environmental Science with the Maryland Environmental Service.  She has taught Earth Science for local colleges and has special interests in wetland and estuarine ecology, plant taxonomy, environmental design, and planning. Martha spends as much time outside as she can.</p>",

The park has excellent facilities and is well-laid out with paved trails, picnic pavilions, open fields, water views, and a visitors center that's modern, clean, and comfortable. Our SHR group has gone there often for kayaking, picnicking, and outdoor concerts. This time we'll be walking around the entire park to see what's there.</p> <p><b>Meetup Spot and Parking</b></p> <p>Meet at the large gazebo behind the Quiet Waters Park entrance sign. From there we can walk into the park for FREE to enjoy its amenities (the entrance fee for cars is $6.00). Ample parking is available just across Hillsmere Drive in the Bay Ridge Shopping Plaza. After our walk, we'll head for the Annapolis Smokehouse located in the shopping plaza, so you'll be close to your car when we're done.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/4/2/d/600_435489261.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Walking Around Quiet Waters Park</b></p> <p>The walk will be approximately five miles on the paved trails that go around the edge of the park. Most of the trails are framed by large trees and thick woods that make this walk both shady and scenic. Our route will pass the pond used for ice skating, the concert area, a dog park, and the waterfront facing the South River. Real restrooms are available at the visitor's center mid-route.</p> <p>Our pace will be easy-going to enjoy the natural surroundings while getting a bit of exercise. If you're late, look for us going counter-clockwise (right) around the park. The entire route is basically a big loop with side trails that brings us back to the park entrance. People can go as fast or slow as they want since we'll all end up at the same place afterward. Total time to circle the park and see everything should be about three hours or so.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/4/1/2/600_435489234.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/4/c/7/600_435489415.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Afterward at the Annapolis Smokehouse</b></p> <p>Following the walk, we'll head to the Annapolis Smokehouse for food and refreshments. It's a popular tavern restaurant located across from Quiet Waters Park in the Bay Ridge Shopping Plaza. The Smokehouse has a full menu that includes BBQ and happy hour specials from 3-7 pm seven days a week. The bar area is large and has a nice ambience. The people are friendly and Jen the owner is a super hostess. </p> <p><br/>As a general rule, our SHR group prefers gathering in the bar area where we can freely mingle and get separate checks with no hassles about group ordering. We also receive much better service by ordering and paying directly at the bar.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.annapolissmokehouse.com\"><a href=\"http://www.annapolissmokehouse.com\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.annapolissmokehouse.com</a></a></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/e/6/600_410319142.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/d/d/600_433358365.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Final Details</b></p> <p>We'll need good walking weather for this event. A little rain won't stop us, but we won't go in miserable conditions. I'll post an update and send out an email by 10:00 am if we need to change plans or cancel. Call Jake at[masked] to find us. I can't always answer my phone at events, but you can try.</p> <p>I hope to see you there!</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/5/7/0/600_435489584.jpeg\" /></p>",

This will be near the end of the hike. This area is used by lots of people to cool off on a hot day.</p> <p><br/>Directions: Take I-695 to Exit 32, MD 1 north (Belair Road), and go 5.5 miles; look for the parking lot on the right after you cross Gunpowder River. The trail starts at the edge of the parking lot behind the bulletin board. </p> <p>Overflow Parking is along Belair Road on the right side past the parking lot.  You can also park at the park-n-ride next to the Gunpowder Lodge at 10092 Belair Road.  If you park at the Gunpowder Lodge walk to the lowest parking lot by the river and you will see a telephone pole with an orange ribbon.  There is a trail that starts there and allows you to cross the river.  Once across the river go right thru the tunnel and up to the bulletin board on your left.</p> <p>GPS Trailhead Coordinates, UTM Zone (WGS84) 18 S, Easting[masked], Northing[masked], Latitude N 39'[masked]\", Longitude W 76'[masked]\"</p> <p>Dogs are welcome on the hike and must be kept on a leash at all times.  You must also pick up after them.</p> <p>It is recommended that you wear hiking boots and/or shoes that you are comfortable in and not afraid to get dirty/wet.  Bring at least 32 ounces of water, sunscreen, bug spray, hiking poles (if needed) and something to snack on if needed.  Also since we do hike thru mud and streams you may want to bring a change of shoes/socks.</p> <p>This trail has several streams along with hills to climb.  The streams you may get wet depending on the weather a couple days ahead of the hike and the amount of run off.</p> <p>We will meet at the bulletin board at 1:30 p.m. and step off for the hike no later than 1:40 p.m.</p> <p>For those that would be interested we can stop by the Gunpowder Lodge for a post hike bite for those who would be interested.  I will leave this up to the group and individuals.</p> <p>If you need to contact me or have any questions my cell number is[masked] or you my contact me via email at [masked] </p> <p>Respectfully,</p> <p>Jim</p>",

Our meetings are 90 minutes long.  We'll continue our readings and discussions from the books of Exodus and Mark as we continue book by book through the Old and New Testaments.</p> <p>All our meetings are at Woods Memorial Presbyterian Church, 611 Baltimore-Annapolis Blvd, Severna Park, MD. Room 154. Enter church front door; go down stairway to left; at 1st landing turn right &amp; go down stairs; room is straight ahead; last room on your left.  A handicapped-accessible entrance is next to our room (through the automatic sliding door) at the rear of the church.</p> <p>I look forward to meeting you all! Have a great week!</p> <p>-Charles</p> <p>Bibles &amp; Hymnals: We have Bibles at the church (New Revised Standard Version) - so everyone has the same Bible for reading along.  Feel free to bring your own Bible, of course!  If you have hymns you would like for us to sing, bring copies of the lyrics and we will try! The church has plenty of hymnals for us to use.  Thanks.</p> <p>Cameras/Photos: Please bring your camera or smart phone and help me remember to take some group photos!  Thanks!</p> <p>Hope:  A new Coptic Christian church was consecrated in Sinai (Egypt) on same day as ISIS murders of Egyptian Copts.  \"ISIS released gruesome video of the executions on the very day, Feb. 15, 2015, that Egypt’s Catholic Coptic Church celebrated the consecration of the first ever church in Sinai, Our Lady of Peace, in the community of Sharm El-Sheikh.\"  See here:  <a href=\"http://www.churchinneed.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=8291&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1001\"><a href=\"http://www.churchinneed.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=8291&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1001\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.churchinneed.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=8291&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1001</a></a></p>",

Yet  the very technology designed for our well-being often serves only to isolate us from one another and distance us from the experience of all that is truly divine.</p> <p><br/>The Bhakti Lounge is a place where incredible transformation and healing takes place all through the culture of bhakti. Meditation, Kirtan, Discussions on the Bhagavad Gita and other ancient texts from the Vedic tradition , Vegetarian food prepared using Bhakti &amp; Ayurvedic principles create an environment where lifelong friendships are made. As one yogi remarked\" I finally found a  community of kindred spirits\"</p> <p><br/>We meet every Sunday on 200 Bloomsbury Avenue Catonsville, MD from 6 pm to 8 pm. Please join us to create a sacred circle of love and devotion and bring bliss/ananda in the Baltimore region and beyond.</p> <p>\n\n\n\nHope to see you soon!</p>",

We'll talk broadly about what makes Meteor different, tradeoffs involved in production usage, Meteor's architecture, and some direct examples of how to get things done. To cap it off, we'll live-code an MVP-style startup showcase site similar to <a href=\"http://proudlymadeindc.com/\">proudlymadeindc.com</a>or <a href=\"http://madewithlove.in/\">madewithlove.in</a></p> <p>We'll also discuss goals for Dev Talks meetings, call for presentations, and network a bit. Come get to know other developers and entrepreneurs based locally, pitch your ideas for presentations, and leave with a few new tools in your belt.</p> <p><b>More on Meteor</b></p> <p>Meteor is a full stack JavaScript framework that helps developers quickly build dynamic web applications. The approach taken by Meteor significantly reduces the complexity of communication between web frontend and server-side backend, making production more efficient. Further, since Meteor is JavaScript based, the learning curve is not steep for most developers.</p>",

The Scenarios for Adventure 1 and Adventure 3 are also available at the store and can be run by anyone with a copy of the core card game and the relevant Adventure Deck numbers. If you can bring a core game please list that with your RSVP so we can expand the number of player seats.</i></b></p> <p><b>Adventure 0-2 - A Pirate's Life</b></p> <p>Yo ho! A pirate’s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there’s more to a pirate’s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what’s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate’s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain’s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.</p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that’s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there’s power, there’s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You’ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you’ll attract a host of powerful enemies.</p> <p>If you can’t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won’t ask questions. They’ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet. </p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can’t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there’s chum in the water, you’ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you’re eager to earn her patronage, then you’d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.</p> <p><br/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:</b></p> <p>1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play, as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we are sure we have space for, but if there is more interest, we can almost certainly make more room. So please sign up for the wait list if you want to play.</p> <p>3.

      "description": "<p>Hello everyone, I apologize for this message being late, it was a hectic week!  Thank you so much to those who attended the first meeting! It was wonderful to have an impromptu discussion with a really interesting and diverse group of people :)  Here are some notes from our interest meeting:</p> <p>-I want to try to meet roughly every two weeks (for the time being).  I'm open for meeting different nights of the week, since I know we all have different schedules.  It seemed like everyone was okay with 7-9ish on weeknights, but obviously this can change as time goes on.</p> <p>-Each discussion meeting will have a theme.  The theme can be specific or broad.</p> <p> -Anyone can suggest and plan a theme/idea.  Please message me so that I can organize everything.  If you have an idea, you can lead the discussion for that week and suggest the articles.</p> <p>-For each meeting, the organizer should suggest 2-3 articles for reading.  These articles are NOT required reading, I just think it helps if we all read similar articles, but you're not going to get kicked out if you don't have the time to read an article.</p> <p> -We figured that the discussion should be 1.5-2 hours, but obviously people can stay later/leave earlier.</p> <p> -We also talked about having a discussion group on meetup/google group/facebook group, something of that nature...maybe we can talk more about that at the next meeting to see what people would prefer?</p> <p>I think that's mostly everything from the last meeting???? Please comment if I forgot something!</p> <p>Anyways, we decided that our first topic for our first meetup would be gentrification.  Below are suggested articles for reading:</p> <p>   1. <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/the_gentrification_myth_it_s_rare_and_not_as_bad_for_the_poor_as_people.single.html\"><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/the_gentrification_myth_it_s_rare_and_not_as_bad_for_the_poor_as_people.single.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/the_gentrification_myth_it_s_rare_and_not_as_bad_for_the_poor_as_people.single.html</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n2. <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/gentrification-2014-2/\"><a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/gentrification-2014-2/\" class=\"linkified\">http://nymag.com/news/features/gentrification-2014-2/</a></a><a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/dan-hancox-barcelona-en-com-take-back-the-city-284\"><a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/dan-hancox-barcelona-en-com-take-back-the-city-284\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/dan-hancox-barcelona-en-com-take-back-the-city-284</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n3. <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2014/04/08/gentrifications_insidious_violence_the_truth_about_american_cities/\"><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2014/04/08/gentrifications_insidious_violence_the_truth_about_american_cities/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.salon.com/2014/04/08/gentrifications_insidious_violence_the_truth_about_american_cities/</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\nI am not an expert on the matter of gentrification by any means, I just picked some articles that I thought were interesting and offered different perspectives.  If these articles are terrible in the grand scheme of things, I apologize in advance, and please bear with me as I learn how to navigate having a group like this :) I really appreciate everyone being understanding since I'm kind of learning as I go with all of this.  Message me with any feedback :)</p> <p>\n\n\nAlso, location is TBD at the moment.  I decided to do my planning today and a lot of places are closed, but I will update the location as soon as I have one :) Have a good holiday weekend, and I look forward to seeing everyone again and meeting new members as well! </p>",

If a game is almost over, it is OK to to finish the game, but it is NOT OK to start a new game around 11PM. Yes, for years, even though our permit was until 10:30 PM, we sometimes played until 11, 11:30 and sometimes even past midnight. Until-a new, nasty custodian turned us in to the Vice Principal, who sent an e-mail to the Rec council who forwarded it to us. We then had to be out of the gym 10:30 PM sharp, NO EXCEPTIONS. After that, when we put in for a new permit, we requested that the time be extended until 11Pm, which was approved. </p> <p>WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW ANYTHING THAT COULD POSSIBLY AFFECT OUR 35+ YEARS CONTINUOUS PERMIT AT THE OM HIGH SCHOOL.</p>",

FUN!</p> <p>However, since each workout program is intentionally different to alleviate boredom and to give you maximum results in minimum time its difficult to describe a \"typical day.\" You can expect some light running, resistance training, obstacle courses, core, body weight, and team training. On some days, you will hike, crawl, lunge, and have a fun time while burning a ton of fat and meeting new people. It's always an adventure! These 1 hour workouts are design to provide a total body workout, in half the time!</p> <p>Can wait to see you at the next session!</p>",

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.</p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate/Fast:</p> <p>One loop only, starting at 6pm.</p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us. Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.</p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.</p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.</p> <p>What to bring:</p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.</p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!( <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/MVDMountainBikers/about/comments/?op=all\">Here</a> )</p>",

      "description": "<p>BANANNA!  So who wants to go see the new minions movie!</p> <p>\n\n\nPlot Summary:</p> <p>The story of Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment's \"Minions\" begins at the dawn of time. Starting as single-celled yellow organisms, \"Minions\" evolve through the ages, perpetually serving the most despicable of masters. Continuously unsuccessful at keeping these masters--from T. rex to Napoleon--the Minions find themselves without someone to serve and fall into a deep depression. But one Minion named Kevin has a plan, and he--alongside teenage rebel Stuart and lovable little Bob--ventures out into the world to find a new evil boss for his brethren to follow. The trio embarks upon a thrilling journey that ultimately leads them to their next potential master, Scarlet Overkill (Academy Award winner Sandra Bullock), the world's first-ever female super-villain. They travel from frigid Antarctica to 1960s New York City, ending in mod London, where they must face their biggest challenge to date: saving all of Minionkind... from annihilation.</p> <p><br/>Trailer:</p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/eisKxhjBnZ0\" class=\"embedded\">https://youtu.be/eisKxhjBnZ0</a></p>",

Both authors have written new books on the Feminine God, and will be talking about their books, with time for group discussion, so bring your questions and thoughts. It is time to honor the feminine in our world and spirituality. Welcome these intelligent, out-of-the-box authors! Books will be available for purchase and signing.</p> <p>Referred to as ‚\"The Voice of Earth Mother\" by a gifted Shoshone elder, Mare Cromwell is a multi-award-winning author, nature mystic and international speaker. Her books include: The Great Mother Bible; Messages from Mother.... Earth Mother; and If I gave you God's Phone Number.... Searching for Spirituality in America. She has studied with Native American teachers for nineteen years and currently sits on the World Council for Wisdom Gatherings. <a href=\"http://www.marecromwell.com\">www.marecromwell.com</a></p> <p>Mare Cromwell was awakened at 5 AM in November of 2013, and given specific instructions from the Great Mother to set aside that winter to listen and write The Great Mother Bible. Out of that spiritual call has come this revolutionary and humorous book of spiritual wisdom that speaks to the wondrous sacred realms in which we live. With teachings ranging from the role of aliens on Earth, the Christ Consciousness, and the need for balance between the Sacred Feminine and Divine Masculine, the Great Mother offers essential guidance to help bring our beleaguered world back into divine harmony.</p> <p>Peter Wilkes, 'A Woman Called God'<br/><a href=\"http://www.awomancalledgod.com\">www.awomancalledgod.com</a></p> <p><br/>As the son of an Episcopal minister, Peter Wilkes had a first-hand look at the inner workings of organized religion throughout his upbringing.  Now seventy years of age he has come to the conclusion that organized religion has continually done more harm than good.  In A Woman Called God, the first in his series of Little books for Big people, he goes back to the source and examines how it’s possible to leave Religion – with a capital “R” – behind and reclaim your soul.</p> <p>And why couldn’t God be a woman? Really, why not? In this adorably playful, yet poignant and timely book, A Woman Called God asks all of us – women and men alike – to consider how the world would and could look if our universal perception of The Creator were not male but female: a mother-figure of unconditional love.</p> <p>The result of a seventy-year personal journey by the author, and inspired initially by his mother and first wife, A Woman Called God revolutionizes the traditional thinking of organized religion and makes possible a new and inviting path for every woman and man on the planet.</p> <p>In its short 545 words you may discover a new way of thinking. In its simple 27 hand-drawn stick-figures you could find a new dialogue. And in its compact 45 pages you might even uncover answers that will take you in a new and welcome direction… both for yourself and the world.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Monet, Cezanne, Degas, Renoir: some of the world’s most popular artists. Their works, and that of their contemporaries, fetch tens of millions of dollars around the globe. But who were they really? Why &amp; how exactly did they paint? What lies behind their enduring appeal?</p> <p>To help answer these questions, this unique film secured unparalleled access to a major new exhibition focussing on the man credited with inventing Impressionism as we know it: 19th century Parisian art collector Paul Durand-Ruel. This eagerly anticipated international exhibition is possibly the most comprehensive exploration of the Impressionists in history.</p> <p>It was Durand-Ruel’s brave decision to exhibit the Impressionists in New York in 1886 that introduced enlightened wealthy Americans to this modern French painting. In doing so, he not only filled great American galleries with Impressionist masterworks, but kept Impressionism alive at a time when it faced complete failure. This energetic and revealing film will tell his remarkable story along with that of the Impressionists themselves. Featuring universally loved masterpieces by Monet, Degas, Cezanne, Renoir, Pissarro and many more.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/7/e/0/600_438138400.jpeg\" /></p>",

Please arrive early to settle into your seats - we start right at 7:00 p.m.</p> <p>We practice Insight Meditation, a style of meditation that helps the mind attain deeper levels of calm concentration through sustained attention on the breath, then combines this with the crucial aspect of insight through contemplation of the mind and body and all of their changing and impermanent senses, emotions and thoughts. Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.</p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.</p> <p><b>Teaching Schedule:</b></p> <p>6/23 Mira     6/30 Mira    </p> <p>7/7  Mira      7/14  Stan     7/21  Stan      7/28  Stan</p> <p>8/4  Stan       8/11  Stan     8/18  Mira     8/25  Stan</p> <p><b>Teachers:</b></p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein</b>, a former high school physics teacher who has been meditating for 30 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.

Great day for a doggy walk around the lake :)  .</p> <p><b><i>Please look carefully at the instructions and map below to find out where to park and meet for the walk!</i></b></p> <p><b>Lake Kittamaqundi,</b> the downtown heart of Columbia. For many years, the path only went only part-way around the lake. But this fall, the Columbia Association completed the circuit and we can now walk around the entire lake along a new paved path!</p> <p>This walk is very flat, only one gentle hill, and 1.5 miles around. We'll pass by the People Tree, the lakefront stage, and long-established Columbia restaurants like Clyde's and Tomato Palace.</p> <p><br/>You will basically head for the new <b>Whole Foods</b> of Columbia (added in Fall 2014), across from the Columbia Mall. However, we will park and meet in the <b><i>lower lot, down the hill,</i></b> and to the right of Whole Foods (as you look at it from the front.) This is actually the parking lot for the new <b>Haven on the Lake</b> spa. Please park in the area <i>furthest from the spa entrance</i>, as shown on the map below, so that we are closest to the trail and won't get in the way of the spa clients.</p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/c/1/3/600_432875859.jpeg\" /></p> <p>SAFETY &amp; COURTESY</p> <p>Please arrive early, to allow the dogs time to sniff and form their pack. We will <b>leave on time.</b>  If you can't make it please change your RSVP promptly, or leave a comment.  We'll turn to the right on the trail (counter clockwise) so you'll know where to find us if you arrive late.  </p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/1/1/d/600_438477629.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/f/a/f/600_436040399.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Please bring water for yourself &amp; your dogs.  We're trying to avoid sharing water on the trail to prevent the chance of spreading the New Dog Flu.<br/></b></p> <p><b>If you see joggers or bikers, please shout \"ON YOUR LEFT\" to keep the dogs safe from being trampled, and to protect others from tripping on our animals.</b></p> <p>PLEASE READ:</p> <p>Columbia Dogs on the Go provides a way for friendly people with friendly dogs to meet people with similar interests on a voluntary basis. By replying \"Yes\" to this RSVP and attending this event, you acknowledge that: </p> <p>•  You are responsible for your own safety and the safety of your dogs and any guests. </p> <p>•  Your dogs are current on their vaccinations.</p> <p>•  Your dogs will be kept on a 6-foot fixed leash (<b>non-retractable</b>) and under your control at the Meetup.</p> <p>•  You will clean up after your dogs at the Meetup.</p> <p>•  You will update your RSVP if your plans change.</p> <p>•  You understand that the <i>Meetup ends when the walk ends</i>. (If you choose to meet other members at a restaurant, dog park, or other location, it is on your own time and not part of the Meetup event.)</p> <p> Looking forward to seeing everyone again!  </p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/f/a/8/600_433013160.jpeg\" /></p> <p>                                                                       Photos by J.

The weekly report (issued on Wednesdays) includes which plants are up, ripe, or in the correct stage for harvesting in the Baltimore/Annapolis/DC area, as well as some basic information such as Latin &amp; common names, which part part of the plant is edible now, where it commonly grows, and some basic nutritional information. The report includes wild edible greens, shoots, roots, tubers, stalks, berries, fungi, nuts, &amp; seeds, and is intended to be a complement to other study on wild edible plants, whether through classes or independent research.

Wheels rolling by 6:00. We will not wait past 6:00.  </p> <p><b>Pace:</b> Pace will be Intermediate, approx. 6.5 to 7 mph. Appropriate for average to riders, but not for beginners, or people who are not riding at least once a week.  Attitude is laid-back and friendly, but please ensure you can handle the pace and length of this ride before committing. This is a no-drop ride, i.e., we wait up for everyone at intersections. (Note: if you don’t want to wait up for slower riders, this is NOT the ride for you, but please also survey your current fitness, as no one likes to be the one person holding up a larger group).  Please also note Ptap rides tend to be about 1 mph slower than Rosy, or Fairland, due terrain.  </p> <p><b>Terrain:</b> Ranges from Easy to Difficult. Most trails are in great shape, but plan on some mud spots. There are a few very steep climbs, rocks and technical sections, log overs (up to 10\" logs, and 3' stacks), tight single track (12\" wide in spots), and a stream crossing or two.  A strong/advanced rider will be able to clean most sections, others will need to get off of their bikes in spots.  This is a friendly ride, so we will wait up for everyone, just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places.  This is a video edit I made from last fall through winter.  We won't hit all of this terrain, but gives you a feel for Patapsco:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M</a></p> <p><b>Distance:</b> With days getting longer we will be minimally getting 10 miles, and if conditions and light allow, we will push towards 20.  Exact route will change depending on group dynamics, trail conditions, daylight, etc.  I will typically have route planned in my head at the beginning of the ride, but will modify as needed to get us back at a reasonable time.  </p> <p><b>Duration:</b> I shoot to have us back before it gets dark (so 2 to 3 hours as the days get longer).  This can change with mechanical issues, and group dynamics though.  As this is a weekday ride, the stops will be just long enough for the last rider to catch their breath.  Note: wheels roll at stated time, so please don’t be late.</p> <p><b>Bring:</b> Helmet (required), water (as much as you can carry), spare tube/patch kit, pump/CO2, multi-tool, I.D., emergency contact info where it can be easily located on your person, and a good attitude, as this ride is as much about camaraderie as it is about riding. Take a look at your bike and make sure it is in good working condition (Ptap will take its toll on the bike).  Bring a light, as you might need it.  There are ton of acceptable lights under $20 on Amazon right now.  Just look for a T6 Cree LED Bike light, with minimially 1000 lumens.  Here is a link to one: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Y1FK18/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">Cheap 1000 lumen bike light</a>&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006QQX3C4/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=3FJIG6WZ09712&amp;coliid=I15GIMB04YOTYI\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p><b>Weather:</b> Shine Only (there will undoubtedly be some mud, but no ride if it’s raining or the trails are too muddy). Protect our trails and don’t ride them when they’re fragile. There may be days where I make a last minute call, so watch this page and our Facebook group on days where there is a chance of rain.</p> <p><b>Ride Organizer</b>(s): Craig P.</p> <p><br/>Craig P, 443-8four5-threesix89; skibum616 at yahoo dot com</p>",

Bring a spray skirt if you have one.</p> <p>We did the last one of these at Daniels Dam on the Patapsco and it actually turned out pretty well at that location so we'll be at Daniels again.  The group is too big for much one one one instruction so we will start off with a couple demonstrations and then break off into groups of two or three to try the rescues.  The last couple of times everyone was too busy practicing to bother stopping to socialize so we will suspend the social hour for this session.</p> <p>Rescues are something that all kayakers need to practice a few times a season whether you've done them before or not.  They need to be something you do instinctively without thinking.  IF YOU ARE NOT PRACTICING YOUR RESCUES A FEW TIMES A SEASON YOU REALLY SHOULD NOT BE PADDLING A KAYAK.</p> <p>There are rental boats available for this paddle at a price of $25.00 for the evening delivered to the put in with paddle and PFD. You can request a rental during the RSVP process.</p>",

      "description": "<p><b>*** If you are attending this practice, please don't forget to sign up on <a href=\"http://www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com\">our website</a> by clicking the \"Sign Up\" link at the top. ***</b></p> <p>The BDBC open practices occur every Wednesday from 6:15 to 7:30 PM and Saturday mornings from 8:30 to 9:30. For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:</p> <p><br/>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.</p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.</p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.</p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.</p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car/on land.</p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.</p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun! More information can be found at &lt;a&gt;www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com.&lt;/a&gt; Hope to see you there!</p>",

It is up to adventurers from heroic factions such as the Emerald Enclave and the Order of the Gauntlet to discover where the true power of each prophet lay, and dismantle it before it comes boiling up to obliterate the Realms.</p> <p>Dungeon and Dragons Encounters run every Wednesday from 7pm - 9pm at the Collector's Corner Outpost in Bel Air Maryland. Grab your dice and your level 1-4 Adventure League character (or use a pre-gen) and join the adventure.</p>",

Our group welcomes anyone who is interested in talking about any aspect of the vegan or veg lifestyle, including health, food preparation, compassion for animals, spirituality, activism, ecology, and more.</p> <p>Our meetings have been fun, lively, and supportive. Mr. Chan has a wonderful selection of vegan menu options, probably the most of any Baltimore area restaurant.  Mr. Chan is located on 1000 Reisterstown Road, across the street from the Pikes Theater. There is often street parking available. And there is free parking behind the restaurant, and a public parking area adjacent to that lot.</p> <p>Meetup attendees get an opportunity each month to tell us a little about themselves: where they are from; what got them interested in the veg/vegan lifestyle; their personal interests; success stories; or a chance to get some answers to questions with regard to diet and lifestyle.</p> <p>And please check out the monthly <b>Earthsave Veg Dinner Series</b> events that are normally held on the last Saturday from 6-8 pm at Towson Presbyterian Church, 400 Chesapeake Ave in Towson. The dinners are vegan and often attract a group of 40-70 attendees.  For more information, see <a href=\"http://earthsavebaltimore.org/.\"><a href=\"http://earthsavebaltimore.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://earthsavebaltimore.org/</a>.</a> Hope to see you there!</p> <p>You may also want to check out the <b>Baltimore Vegetarian Meetup</b> group, which is very similar to this one, but meets on the first Sunday, at 12.30 pm, at <b>Mango Grove</b> in Columbia.

      "description": "<p><b>What:</b> This is an open ongoing mindfulness meditation group for both beginners and experienced practitioners.</p> <p>While the forms of meditation we practice are rooted in Buddhist teachings, the study and practice of mindfulness and insight meditation is applicable to anyone from any background or religion, and all are welcome.</p> <p><i>These teachings are available to all. Although a $5-$10 donation is suggested, donations are not required for attendance.</i></p> <p><br/><b>Each class will include:</b> guided meditation, instruction, opportunities to practice, and time for discussion, questions and answers.</p> <p><b>When and where:</b> We meet every Tuesday from 7:30-9:00 p.m. at Centennial High School, 4300 Centennial Lane, Ellicott City, MD, 21042, room 406. Please arrive early to settle into your seats - we start right at 7:30 p.m.</p> <p><b>We practice Insight Meditation</b>, a style of meditation that helps the mind attain deeper levels of calm concentration through sustained attention on the breath, then combines this with the crucial aspect of insight through contemplation of the mind and body and all of their changing and impermanent senses, emotions and thoughts. Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.</p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.</p> <p><b>Teacher:</b></p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein</b>, a high school physics teacher who has been meditating for 25 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004. Stan is a mentor with the Insight Meditation Community of Washington (IMCW) and is a graduate of the Meditation Teacher Training Institute, a two-year certification program with senior Insight teachers Tara Brach, Jonathan Foust, Hugh Byrne, and Pat Coffey. He also teaches Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Stan also earned a Masters of Social Work in 1998.</p> <p><br/><b>Location: Oakland Manor Town Center (TC) Room.<br/></b></p> <p>Park anywhere in the Oakland Manor Parking lot. When facing the front entrance of building, entrance to the meditation room is on the <i>right</i> side of the building, down a few steps to get to the entrance.<b><br/></b></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Centennial High School Parking (see map below) - September through June:</b></p> <p>If coming to the school from the South (Route 108) side of Centennial Lane, make a left into the bus loop just as you reach the school. Immediately on your left is a drive to a parking lot on the south/left side of the school. Park in this lot and follow the signs to room 406.</p> <p>If coming to the school from the North (Route 40) side of Centennial Lane, make a right into the bus loop just as you finish passing the school.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.</p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.</p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.</p> <p><br/>4.

      "description": "<p>About the Series and Inspiration:</p> <p>In my 10 years of experience in spirituality, I have run the gamut. I’ve gone to conventions, crystal shows, spiritual workshops, yoga retreats, angel classes, healing circles and more Reiki shares than you can shake a stick at. All of it has led me to believe that 90% of healers and spiritualists of this age are lost. Not lost as in they do not know what to do, many have pretty spot-on intuition, but lost as in they do not know how healing works. They do not understand the intricies of the art. The universal language is misunderstood, nonthought is a non-thought, intention and expectation become something that must be said aloud before the healing begins and often times fail to understand the limits of their own modalities. The classes in this series are designed to fill the cracks in the foundation. We’ll be dedicating classes to concepts such as nonthought, karma, the universal language, how to heal ailments hard-written into the body versus those that are not and many more.</p> <p>Intuition and Telepathy:</p> <p>Intuition and telepathy, in my opinion, should be taught in every healing attunement or initiation class there is. No healer can effectively heal without developing these two similar but different skills. They are the core skills needed in being able to diagnose those you work on. Most healers who I ask about intuition say something like “you just know” or “it comes to you.” Healing isn’t Nike. You don’t just do it. In my experience, there is actual methodology that needs to be developed, knowledge that needs to be conveyed and most importantly, practice that needs to happen before skills like intuition and telepathy can truly develop. Not only will this class explain what telepathy and intuition are, but it will also give you tools you can use to develop them both on a daily basis and supply you with more tools to help your process of diagnosing the client so that you can understand exactly what to heal.</p> <p>What will you be able to do after this class?</p> <p>• Understand true telepathy such that even the logical brain sees the sense of it</p> <p>• Know how intuition relates to telepathy</p> <p>• Use “body hacks” to get your biological self to work with the higher self when tapping into intuition</p> <p>• Have a few telepathic exercises that you can practice to hone your skills</p> <p>• Transpose the skills of telepathy and intuition to other avenues of spiritual development<br/> </p> <p>Required Healing Experience: None!</p> <p><br/> These classes will be geared towards advanced healers, so at least a few years of experience with energetic healing arts, such as Reiki, Seichim, qigong or crystal work will provide a great foundation to understand the concepts discussed. However, the healing secrets exposed in this class series will be explained in such a way that even those with little to no basic knowledge of energy, healing or spirituality will be able to understand.</p> <p>Investment: $10; cash only upon arrival (no credit card or checks) Pre-register early to reserve your seat! <br/>Minimum to hold class: 6 attendees</p> <p><br/>For more info: Contact Colton Parker: <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]</a> or<br/>call: &lt;a&gt;(301)[masked]&lt;/a&gt;  </p> <p><br/><a href=\"https://youtu.be/knXQVhhXZPU\" class=\"embedded\">https://youtu.be/knXQVhhXZPU</a></p> <p>\n\n\n****On the night of this event, please contact presenter at the information above to ensure questions will be addressed promptly.  Receptionist is not available to answer calls in the evenings.****</p> <p>-------</p> <p>\n\nAbout Colton:</p> <p>Colton is a spiritual-realist. He ascribes to no one modality of spirituality, rather allows as many as possible shape and shift his own consciousness, guiding him to his own inner truth. He has a Bachelor’s degree in Operations Management with a minor in Japanese, which have heavily affected his spiritual path. He also has a strong background in reiki, possessing a master-teacher certification for usui reiki(1-4 and 5-18), kundalini reiki, lighterian reiki, karunaki, shamballa (multidimensional healing or MDH) and ayurvedic reiki. He prides himself on being a teacher not only to his formal students but also to friends and family, teaching even as they realize not how they are being taught. As a teacher, Colton’s uniqueness lies in his clarity of expression, his ability to see connections overlooked by others, and the shifted state he enters when teaching a class. His spiritual growth was most affected by his 10+ years of reiki and crystal experiences, his current pursuit of kundalini yoga teaching certification, his study of quantum physics, the eight months he spent in Japan, as well as his own spiritual teachers.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Our July book is <b>Wild: From Lost To Found On The Pacific Crest Trail</b> by Cheryl Strayed. Wild is a powerful, blazingly honest, inspiring memoir: the story of a 1,100 mile solo hike that broke down a young woman reeling from catastrophe - and built her back up again.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>This is a very popular book so if you are getting this book from the Library, put your request in now because it will take about a month and a half to get the book.</b></p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/0/2/7/600_436940519.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\nSince our discussion is held at the Nordstrom Market Cafe, I plan on enjoying dinner during our discussion. Eating or drinking is optional but I certainly plan on enjoying something to eat and drink during our discussion. The Nordstrom Market Cafe is located on the second floor of Norstroms in the Columbia Mall.</p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Synopsis</b></p> <p>\n\n\nA powerful, blazingly honest memoir: the story of an eleven-hundred-mile solo hike that broke down a young woman reeling from catastrophe - and built her back up again.</p> <p>\n\nAt twenty-two, Cheryl Strayed thought she had lost everything. In the wake of her mother's death, her family scattered, and her own marriage was soon destroyed. Four years later, with nothing more to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life: to hike the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State—and to do it alone. She had no experience as a long-distance hiker, and the trail was little more than “an idea, vague and outlandish and full of promise.” But it was a promise of piecing back together a life that had come undone.</p> <p>Strayed faces down rattlesnakes and black bears, intense heat and record snowfalls, and both the beauty and loneliness of the trail. Told with great suspense and style, sparkling with warmth and humor, <b>Wild</b> vividly captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddened, strengthened, and ultimately healed her.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/d/6/2/600_431556194.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Book Availability at the Howard Count Public Library</b></p> <p><br/><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Wild</b> is available for checkout at the Howard County Public Library. The Howard County Public Library has:</p> <p>(22) Copies of the book; 315 pages.</p> <p>(3) Copies in large print.</p> <p>(10) Copies as books on CD.</p> <p>(2) Copies as downloadable audio.</p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Howard County Library Central Branch</b></p> <p>10375 Little Patuxent Pkwy</p> <p>Columbia, MD 21044</p> <p>(410)[masked]</p> <p>Branch Hours</p> <p>Mon. - Thurs. 10 am - 9 pm</p> <p>Fri. - Sat. 10 am - 6 pm</p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Discussion Questions</b></p> <p>\n\n\n1. “The Pacific Crest Trail wasn’t a world to me then. It was an idea, vague and outlandish, full of promise and mystery. Something bloomed inside me as I traced its jagged line with my finger on a map” (p. 4). Why did the PCT capture Strayed’s imagination at that point in her life?</p> <p>\n\n2. Each section of the book opens with a literary quote or two. What do they tell you about what’s to come in the pages that follow? How does Strayed’s pairing of, say, Adrienne Rich and Joni Mitchell (p. 45) provide insight into her way of thinking?</p> <p>3. Strayed is quite forthright in her description of her own transgressions, and while she’s remorseful, she never seems ashamed. Is this a sign of strength or a character flaw?</p> <p>4. “I knew that if I allowed fear to overtake me, my journey was doomed. Fear, to a great extent, is born of a story we tell ourselves, and so I chose to tell myself a different story from the one women are told” (p. 51). Fear is a major theme in the book. Do you think Strayed was too afraid, or not afraid enough? When were you most afraid for her?</p> <p>5. Strayed chose her own last name: “Nothing fit until one day when the word strayed came into my mind. Immediately, I looked it up in the dictionary and knew it was mine...: to wander from the proper path, to deviate from the direct course, to be lost, to become wild, to be without a mother or father, to be without a home, to move about aimlessly in search of something, to diverge or digress” (p. 96). Did she choose well? What did you think when you learned she had assigned this word to herself—that it was no coincidence?</p> <p>6. On the trail, Strayed encounters mostly men. How does this work in her favor? What role does gender play when removed from the usual structure of society?</p> <p>7. What does the reader learn from the horrific episode in which Strayed and her brother put down their mother’s horse?</p> <p>8. Strayed writes that the point of the PCT “had only to do with how it felt to be in the wild. With what it was like to walk for miles for no reason other than to witness the accumulation of trees and meadows, mountains and deserts, streams and rocks, rivers and grasses, sunrises and sunsets” (p. 207). How does this sensation help Strayed to find her way back into the world beyond the wilderness?</p> <p>9. On her journey, Strayed carries several totems. What does the black feather mean to her? And the POW bracelet? Why does she find its loss (p. 238) symbolic?</p> <p>10. Does the hike help Strayed to get over Paul? If so, how? And if not, why?</p> <p>11. Strayed says her mother’s death “had obliterated me.... I was trapped by her but utterly alone. She would always be the empty bowl that no one could fill” (p 267). How did being on the PCT on her mother’s fiftieth birthday help Strayed to heal this wound?</p> <p>12. What was it about Strayed that inspired the generosity of so many strangers on the PCT?</p> <p>13. “There’s no way to know what makes one thing happen and not another.... But I was pretty certain as I sat there that night that if it hadn’t been for Eddie, I wouldn’t have found myself on the PCT” (p. 304). How does this realization change Strayed’s attitude towards her stepfather?</p> <p>14. To lighten her load, Strayed burns each book as she reads it. Why doesn’t she burn the Adrienne Rich collection?</p> <p>15. What role do books and reading play in this often solitary journey?</p>",

Most of our meetings are informal and we tend to discuss whatever anyone has brought with them to show as well as discussing local rockhounding areas.</p> <p>Even though we usually plan to wrap-up around 9pm, most of us are usually still chatting at 10. It is amazing the amount of knowledge that we share with each other and the body of knowledge that we have as a group. All of our meetings have been great (even when only a few show up).</p> <p>I do ask that you RSVP for our meeting, but... if you haven’t RSVP'd and would still like to come to the meeting – please do. The RSVP helps the meeting by showing others that we do have a group and that there will be a meeting that night. If you RSVP’d yes and can’t make it, that’s OK too (you can always change your RSVP at any time).</p> <p>I hope that you will consider attending (newbie or old-hand). Our group has been meeting for over 3 years now. We have over 150 total members and we’ve maintained a 5 star rating for our meetings. I believe that you will enjoy yourself and we will enjoy your company too.</p> <p>As always, everyone is invited to our meetings (including your non-Rockhound guests). I have videos from Cash and Treasures shows that cover some great rockhounding locations and I will bring out some of my \"treasures\".</p> <p>I hope you can make it, we are very informal, don't forget to bring someting (rocks, fossils, yard rock, book, map, whatever) to discuss.</p> <p>Wayne Homens</p> <p>Founder, <br/>Central Maryland Rock and Mineral Exchange Meetup</p>",

The Boyz are five all-singing, all-dancing heartthrobs from Ohio: Matthew, Mark, Luke, Juan and Abraham. As they perform their signature hits such as 'Rhythm In Me,' 'The Calling,' and 'I Believe,' the Boyz question their loyalty to each other and ask whether or not faith is really holding them together. They finally deliver a message of unity, that 'there is no star as bright as its constellation, no harmony in a single voice.'<br/>Presented by arrangement with Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Theatricals.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Private Event! This event is in my home so please only RSVP if I have met you at a prior event.<br/>Caverna: The Cave Farmers is a worker-placement game at heart, with a focus on farming. In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/e/5/f/600_439704159.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/e/7/1/600_439704177.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29qOvirR38E\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29qOvirR38E</a></p>",

      "description": "<p>We are all a bit geeky, so why not make a night of it.  In hopes that we will explore various geek-tastic places I figure we might as well start with one that is a personal favorite.  Added bonus: to make it easier to find the group I propose we all dress in our finest geek-wear. (Open to self-interpretation, just remember this is a family-friendly establishment.)</p> <p>Yes, that is right we are going to the <a href=\"http://www.mdsci.org\">Maryland Science Center.</a> I will change from my work uniform to join crowd for a fun filled geek night.  Things one can do besides explore the exhibit halls include see a planetarium show, see an IMAX film, and even look through the telescope on the roof (weather permitting). Once inside, we can split into sub-groups to explore all that the Science Center has to offer and plan to meet back at certain times to check-in or gather again to go as a group to a show, or to get food.</p> <p>This particular Friday has a Patio Party, with a live band, snack and drinks for purchase, and activities to do on the front patio. There is also a lot happening inside the museum as well.</p> <p><br/>We will meet inside at the harbor entrance* and from there go in to get our tickets.  <b>Fridays After 5 price of $9 </b>includes permanent exhibit halls, planetarium, and IMAX Theater. </p> <p><br/><b>NOTE:</b> Anyone who wishes to see a planetarium show must arrive earlier than 6pm since 6pm that is when the last show is playing and it is first come first serve seating. The last IMAX is at 7pm and it is <a href=\"http://www.mdsci.org/imax/island-lemurs-madagascar-3d/\">Island of Lemurs: Madagascar 3D</a>.  If you think you want to see a show, either planetarium or IMAX, please leave a comment below and know that you will need to arrive earlier than 6pm.</p> <p><br/><b>Bonus New Member Deal: </b>First 3 new members to arrive will get a discount for being awesome.**</p> <p>Hope to see you there!</p> <p><br/>*I will give people my cell number day of for easy location.<br/>**A new member is counted as someone who has been to less than 3 meetups.</p>",

Let’s make a lasting impression on the festival!</p> <p>Hares: Fuck-a-Duck &amp; Just Kim</p> <p>When: Friday July 17th, 2015</p> <p><br/>Time: Prelube at 6:25PM, pack away at 6:55PM</p> <p>Where: Prelube and start at Rocket to Venus (A - A' Trail)</p> <p>3360 Chestnut Ave, Baltimore, MD 21211</p> <p>Cost: $6 or 58 Russian Rubles.</p> <p>Parking: Hampden has a lot of street parking near the start location but make sure you check the meters. Some end charging at 8pm, some at 6pm. This is your official notice.</p> <p>Important Note(s): If you plan on doing the bash, you will need to have a bike (duh), a light either on your bike or cranium, and mostly importantly – a helmet. We are going to take that seriously – everyone who is on the bash trail will need to have a helmet. Also, expect the bash trail to be quite longer than a normal hash trail. For the regular trail(s), bring a light and a dry bag just in case. And yes, a bag vehicle will be available. </p> <p>On – I wonder if what I do to ducks can be considered art – On</p> <p>-F*ck-a-Duck</p>",

No matter what else we do, the primary focus of life – thoughts, words and actions- should be on the growth of the heart in all its different realms.As we grow in the realms of the heart, we become able to see, feel and understand people around us. Therefore, our relationships with others become deeper and more harmonious. As the heart grows, so does the love, and so does our ability to experience lasting happiness in all areas of our lives.” Mehrdad Mizani</p> <p>To see a sample of Mehrdad's talk, go to the following links:<a href=\"http://batgap.com/mehrdad-mizani/\"><a href=\"http://batgap.com/mehrdad-mizani/\" class=\"linkified\">http://batgap.com/mehrdad-mizani/</a></a><br/><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/thewayofheart\"><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/thewayofheart\" class=\"embedded\">http://www.youtube.com/user/thewayofheart</a></a></p> <p>Below Mehrdad on Jordan Rich show....delightful</p> <p><a href=\"http://boston.cbslocal.com/?podcast_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.podtrac.com%2Fpts%2Fredirect.mp3%2Fnyc.podcast.play.it%2Fmedia%2Fd0%2Fd0%2Fd1%2Fd2%2FdI%2FdJ%2FdO%2F12IJO_4.MP3%3Fauthtok%3D5562056298000598828_6ScUksjm73lKMqzU4LwR363IfI&amp;podcast_name=Music+For+The+Soul&amp;podcast_artist=Jordan+Rich&amp;station_id=91&amp;tag=&amp;dcid=CBS.BOSTON\"><a href=\"http://boston.cbslocal.com/?podcast_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.podtrac.com%2Fpts%2Fredirect.mp3%2Fnyc.podcast.play.it%2Fmedia%2Fd0%2Fd0%2Fd1%2Fd2%2FdI%2FdJ%2FdO%2F12IJO_4.MP3%3Fauthtok%3D5562056298000598828_6ScUksjm73lKMqzU4LwR363IfI&amp;podcast_name=Music+For+The+Soul&amp;podcast_artist=Jordan+Rich&amp;station_id=91&amp;tag=&amp;dcid=CBS.BOSTON\" class=\"linkified\">http://boston.cbslocal.com/?podcast_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.podtrac.com%2Fpts%2Fredirect.mp3%2Fnyc.podcast.play.it%2Fmedia%2Fd0%2Fd0%2Fd1%2Fd2%2FdI%2FdJ%2FdO%2F12IJO_4.MP3%3Fauthtok%3D5562056298000598828_6ScUksjm73lKMqzU4LwR363IfI&amp;podcast_name=Music+For+The+Soul&amp;podcast_artist=Jordan+Rich&amp;station_id=91&amp;tag=&amp;dcid=CBS.BOSTON</a></a></p>",

We carry many fellow travelers.  While representing only about 1-3% of the total body mass, the human body contains more than ten times the microbial cells than human cells.  Dr Owen White tells us about how we are characterizing these microbial communities, and what we are doing with this information, in the context of the Human Microbiome Project and \"big data\".</p> <p><br/>After the Human Genome Project, interest grew in sequencing the “other genome\" of microbes carried in and on the human body. Microbial ecologists, realizing that &gt;99% of environmental microbes could not be easily cultured, developed approaches to study microorganisms, primarily by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S) as a phylogenetic and taxonomic marker to identify members of microbial communities. This has precipitated a sea change in the study of microbes and human health, inspiring the new term “metagenomics\" both to describe a technological approach—sequencing and analysis of the genes from whole communities rather than from individual genomes—and to emphasize that microbes function within communities rather than as individual species. The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) has provided important information from healthy people, to serve in comparisons looking for bacterial communities and gene patterns associated with health and disease. The human microbiome, the large-scale data management required to analysis the HMP data, and the implications of the HMP with respect to our daily lives will be discussed in this presentation.</p> <p>Owen R. White, PhD, is the Director of the Bioinformatics department at the Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) and a Professor of Epidemiology and Public Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland.</p> <p>## Tickets are FREE, but please <a href=\"https://bugssevent.tixato.com/buy/the-human-microbiome-talk-by-dr-owen-white\">RSVP HERE</a>.  Also, please donate to keep great things like this happening</p>",

So plan accordingly. Once you reach the contact station, please park and enter the contact station with your license number in hand and complete the visitor form.</p> <p>We will meet at the contact station and divide the group.

Let's get out there and see if we get lucky.</p> <p>We will drive the paved wildlife loop in hopes of finding summer birds, including indigo buntings, sparrows, and warblers.</p> <p>We'll spend time stalking the Ruby Throated Hummingbirds for that perfect image.</p> <p>We will meet at the North Tract of Patuxent Research Refuge. Bring water and a snack. Prepare for the heat accordingly.</p> <p>All visitors are required to sign in with the visitors center, and sign out prior to departure.</p>",

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:</p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.</p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.</p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.</p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.</p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car/on land.</p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.</p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun! More information can be found at &lt;a&gt;www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com.&lt;/a&gt; Hope to see you there!</p>",

Calvert St. and E. Centre St., goes through the back entrance gate on Guilford Ave, and ends at the door of the Book Bank warehouse.   This video can be found at <a href=\"http://youtu.be/I5cwEo_aKfQ\"><a href=\"http://youtu.be/I5cwEo_aKfQ\" class=\"embedded\">http://youtu.be/I5cwEo_aKfQ</a></a> .</p> <p> </p>",

For those interested in the BIC Wing (best all-around board on the market), this is the place to give it a whirl. Also, they will have boards from Surftech which also make a whole lot of great boards (including a group favorite known as the Raven).</p> <p>We are thinking about organizing an Annapolis paddle that day to make it worth the trip. Send me a message via Meetup if you like the idea. We could just launch from Truxton Park to make it simple. I will setup a paddle if I hear from enough folks.</p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/2/0/600_439380544.jpeg\" /></p>",

      "description": "<p>Our July book is <b>Wild: From Lost To Found On The Pacific Crest Trail</b> by Cheryl Strayed. Wild is a powerful, blazingly honest, inspiring memoir: the story of a 1,100 mile solo hike that broke down a young woman reeling from catastrophe - and built her back up again.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>This is a very popular book so if you are getting this book from the Library, put your request in now because it will take about a month and a half to get the book.</b></p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/0/2/7/600_436940519.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Synopsis</b></p> <p>\n\n\nA powerful, blazingly honest memoir: the story of an eleven-hundred-mile solo hike that broke down a young woman reeling from catastrophe - and built her back up again.</p> <p>\n\nAt twenty-two, Cheryl Strayed thought she had lost everything. In the wake of her mother's death, her family scattered, and her own marriage was soon destroyed. Four years later, with nothing more to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life: to hike the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State—and to do it alone. She had no experience as a long-distance hiker, and the trail was little more than “an idea, vague and outlandish and full of promise.” But it was a promise of piecing back together a life that had come undone.</p> <p>Strayed faces down rattlesnakes and black bears, intense heat and record snowfalls, and both the beauty and loneliness of the trail. Told with great suspense and style, sparkling with warmth and humor, <b>Wild</b> vividly captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddened, strengthened, and ultimately healed her.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/d/6/2/600_431556194.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Book Availability at the Howard Count Public Library</b></p> <p><br/><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Wild</b> is available for checkout at the Howard County Public Library. The Howard County Public Library has:</p> <p>(22) Copies of the book; 315 pages.</p> <p>(3) Copies in large print.</p> <p>(10) Copies as books on CD.</p> <p>(2) Copies as downloadable audio.</p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Howard County Library Central Branch</b></p> <p>10375 Little Patuxent Pkwy</p> <p>Columbia, MD 21044</p> <p>(410)[masked]</p> <p>Branch Hours</p> <p>Mon. - Thurs. 10 am - 9 pm</p> <p>Fri. - Sat. 10 am - 6 pm</p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Discussion Questions</b></p> <p>\n\n\n1. “The Pacific Crest Trail wasn’t a world to me then. It was an idea, vague and outlandish, full of promise and mystery. Something bloomed inside me as I traced its jagged line with my finger on a map” (p. 4). Why did the PCT capture Strayed’s imagination at that point in her life?</p> <p>\n\n2. Each section of the book opens with a literary quote or two. What do they tell you about what’s to come in the pages that follow? How does Strayed’s pairing of, say, Adrienne Rich and Joni Mitchell (p. 45) provide insight into her way of thinking?</p> <p>3. Strayed is quite forthright in her description of her own transgressions, and while she’s remorseful, she never seems ashamed. Is this a sign of strength or a character flaw?</p> <p>4. “I knew that if I allowed fear to overtake me, my journey was doomed. Fear, to a great extent, is born of a story we tell ourselves, and so I chose to tell myself a different story from the one women are told” (p. 51). Fear is a major theme in the book. Do you think Strayed was too afraid, or not afraid enough? When were you most afraid for her?</p> <p>5. Strayed chose her own last name: “Nothing fit until one day when the word strayed came into my mind. Immediately, I looked it up in the dictionary and knew it was mine...: to wander from the proper path, to deviate from the direct course, to be lost, to become wild, to be without a mother or father, to be without a home, to move about aimlessly in search of something, to diverge or digress” (p. 96). Did she choose well? What did you think when you learned she had assigned this word to herself—that it was no coincidence?</p> <p>6. On the trail, Strayed encounters mostly men. How does this work in her favor? What role does gender play when removed from the usual structure of society?</p> <p>7. What does the reader learn from the horrific episode in which Strayed and her brother put down their mother’s horse?</p> <p>8. Strayed writes that the point of the PCT “had only to do with how it felt to be in the wild. With what it was like to walk for miles for no reason other than to witness the accumulation of trees and meadows, mountains and deserts, streams and rocks, rivers and grasses, sunrises and sunsets” (p. 207). How does this sensation help Strayed to find her way back into the world beyond the wilderness?</p> <p>9. On her journey, Strayed carries several totems. What does the black feather mean to her? And the POW bracelet? Why does she find its loss (p. 238) symbolic?</p> <p>10. Does the hike help Strayed to get over Paul? If so, how? And if not, why?</p> <p>11. Strayed says her mother’s death “had obliterated me.... I was trapped by her but utterly alone. She would always be the empty bowl that no one could fill” (p 267). How did being on the PCT on her mother’s fiftieth birthday help Strayed to heal this wound?</p> <p>12. What was it about Strayed that inspired the generosity of so many strangers on the PCT?</p> <p>13. “There’s no way to know what makes one thing happen and not another.... But I was pretty certain as I sat there that night that if it hadn’t been for Eddie, I wouldn’t have found myself on the PCT” (p. 304). How does this realization change Strayed’s attitude towards her stepfather?</p> <p>14. To lighten her load, Strayed burns each book as she reads it. Why doesn’t she burn the Adrienne Rich collection?</p> <p>15. What role do books and reading play in this often solitary journey?</p>",

Artscape is an enormous indoor and outdoor street festival that combines quirky art, zany participants, colorful exhibits, and lively entertainment mixed with a friendly crowd enjoying the festivities. It's FREE and it's FUN, which makes it a perfect fit for Second Half Rally!</p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/8/5/600_435616517.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/7/8/600_435616504.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/8/f/600_435616527.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Meet Up at Cross Street Market</b></p> <p><br/>We'll gather inside the Cross Street Market on Federal Hill to grab a quick bite and refreshments before heading across town to the festival area. Look for us on the Charles St. end of the market area where people are eating and drinking at Nick's Seafood.</p> <p>We can mingle with the locals at the market while enjoying some Bawlmer food and drink to sustain us for the bus ride. Bruce Lee Wings has excellent burgers and juicy wings that are both tasty and inexpensive. Next to it is Nick's Seafood where they serve sushi, steamed shrimp, and a variety of beers that customers consume at barrel tables in the market's aisles.</p> <p>As the center of neighborhood life on Federal Hill, Cross Street Market is an authentic Baltimore experience and always entertaining.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/9/c/600_435616540.jpeg\" /></p> <p>From Cross Street Market, we'll catch the free Charm City Circulator bus over to the festival area. It's a nice ride up historic Charles St. past the Washington Monument (yes, Baltimore has one too) that lets us avoid the closed streets, traffic, and parking hassles near the festival area. Details below:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.charmcitycirculator.com/sites/default/files/Purple_Route_Map_12.pdf\"><a href=\"http://www.charmcitycirculator.com/sites/default/files/Purple_Route_Map_12.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.charmcitycirculator.com/sites/default/files/Purple_Route_Map_12.pdf</a></a></p> <p>Federal Hill is an urban area with limited street parking. The best place to avoid getting a ticket is the West Street Parking Garage operated by the City of Baltimore. It's located at 40 E West St, Baltimore, MD 21230, and parking for all day is $14. The garage is just one block away from the Cross Street Market, so it's very convenient for our visit.</p> <p><b>The Baltimore Artscape Festival</b></p> <p>Artscape is America's largest free arts festival, attracting 400,000+ attendees over three days. It features more than 150 fine artists, fashion designers and craftspeople; visual art exhibits on and off-site, including exhibitions, outdoor sculpture, art cars, photography; live concerts on outdoor stages; and a full schedule of performing arts including dance, opera, theater, film, experimental music and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Vendors serving an international menu of food and beverages is available throughout the festival site. </p> <p><br/>Full details about the Artscape festival and scheduled events are available here:</p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://www.artscape.org/\"><a href=\"http://www.artscape.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.artscape.org</a></a></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/c/f/600_435616591.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/d/b/600_435616603.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/e/6/600_435616614.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/f/2/600_435616626.jpeg\" /></p> <p>After arriving at the festival, our SHR group usually splinters into smaller groups as people wander around the exhibits and street performances. When you're ready to leave, it's easy to catch the Circulator bus back to Cross Street Market and our parked cars. The bus runs every 15 minutes from at stop at St. Paul and Preston Streets. Look for the purple Circulator bus stop sign.</p> <p><b>Final Details</b></p> <p>Artscape is another truly unique Baltimore adventure with plenty of exciting fun, entertainment, and interesting things to see. The eating and drinking part is pretty good too.</p> <p>Call Jake at[masked] if you have any questions or trouble finding us. I can't always hear my phone at events, but you can try. </p> <p>I hope to see you there!</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/b/c/600_435616572.jpeg\" /></p>",

      "description": "<p>This Month I'd like us to have two meetups. Since the summer is CRAZY and we all have plans. This way, you can have two opportunities to get together with our gals! </p> <p>At the last meetup we discussed <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13450339-poison-princess?ac=1\">Poison Princess</a> By: Kresley Cole. It is not the official book for Vaginal Fantasy but something our own club picked out. Let's give it a try!</p> <p><br/>Summary: </p> <p><i>Sixteen-year-old Evangeline \"Evie\" Greene leads a charmed life, until she begins experiencing horrifying hallucinations. When an apocalyptic event decimates her Louisiana hometown, Evie realizes her hallucinations were actually visions of the future—and they're still happening. Fighting for her life and desperate for answers, she must turn to her wrong-side-of-the-bayou classmate: Jack Deveaux.</i></p> <p><i>But she can't do either alone.</i></p> <p><i>With his mile-long rap sheet, wicked grin, and bad attitude, Jack is like no boy Evie has ever known. Even though he once scorned her and everything she represented, he agrees to protect Evie on her quest. She knows she can't totally depend on Jack. If he ever cast that wicked grin her way, could she possibly resist him?</i></p> <p><i>Who can Evie trust?</i></p> <p><i>As Jack and Evie race to find the source of her visions, they meet others who have gotten the same call. An ancient prophesy is being played out, and Evie is not the only one with special powers. A group of twenty-two teens has been chosen to reenact the ultimate battle between good and evil. But it's not always clear who is on which side.</i></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18628458-taken-by-the-t-rex\">&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p>Watch Felicia Day lead online discussion on the Vaginal Fantasy&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPmtjirgHtbF9lryHaawLIg\"&gt;youtube page</a>, or follow the group on the <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/62938-vaginal-fantasy-book-club\">goodreads page</a>! </p>",

Beginner kayakers are provided kayaking instruction and skill building tips in a safe and controlled environment in one of our beautiful park pools. Not a beginner and just want to practice? We can go over the basics of rescue techniques and wet exits. We will be at the Cherry Hill Splash Park every Saturday from 1-3 pm there is a $2 general admission to enter the pool. Some folks just need a 15 min refresher and others want to just hang out at the pool. We recommend you bring a chair and what ever else you need to spend the afternoon at the pool. There is a 3 story spiral water slide at this pool(FYI)! Please come dressed to swim in the pool!</p> <p>Participants must be 50 pounds and up and children under 18 must be accompanied by a parent to kayak. RESERVATIONS ARE RECOMMENDED.</p>",

Another park plans to overrun our allies so we must offer what assistance we can! </p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are a chapter of the LARP rule-set of 'Amtgard' (Rising Sun Station). We meet every Sunday (except on special events and extreme inclement weather). If it's raining or snowing, we are usually still out! </p> <p>Amtgard is a world-wide organization dedicated to medieval and fantasy combat sports and recreation. We use padded weapons, fantasy and authentic clothing, and imagination to immerse players in a world of heroic combat, quests, crafts, and more.</p> <p>No matter if your interest is competitive sports fighting, finding an outlet for your creative talents, or honing your leadership skills, Amtgard has something to offer you! We not only teach boffer style fighting but various arts and sciences such as chainmail making, leather crafting, archery, and more! </p> <p>This Sunday will be a members' choice day! Fighters can choose from a variety of games. Practice run until we get tired or the sun starts to go down. Usually the latter happens first! </p> <p><i>But What Do I Bring?....</i>  Yourself , plenty of water to drink and the want to learn! For your first month, you don't need to really bring anything! We have gear you can use (if you have medeival-esque clothing than it is encouraged) We will run you through basic rules, help you decide on a 'class', and show you different weapon-styles. Players are encouraged to decide on an 'in game' name. </p> <p><i>What should I do to prepare?:</i>  We ask that you read through the rulebook! It will make the process a lot faster so that you are able to have a basic knowledge of the system. You can find it available here ( &lt;a&gt;www.warlordsports.com)&lt;/a&gt; Go to Menu-&gt;resources-&gt;AmtgardV8 rules-&gt; <a href=\"http://www.warlordsports.com/documents/v8/v8_RC0.7.4.pdf\">V8 RC 0.7.4 Rules</a></p> <p><i>What to do when I first arrive:</i> Look around for people in awesome clothes and/or lots of equipment laying on the ground. Don't hesitate to walk on up and say hello! A player can direct you to the correct individuals that will assist you with getting signed in, and running you through the basics.</p> <p><b>Resources:</b> Our group has several resources that can be used. Our facebook group has the most up to date information and day to day chatter between park members.

      "description": "<p>The year is 1896, the place, New York City. On a cold March night <i>New York Times </i>reporter John Schuyler Moore is summoned to the East River by his friend and former Harvard classmate Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, a psychologist, or \"alienist.\" On the unfinished Williamsburg Bridge, they view the horribly mutilated body of an adolescent boy, a prostitute from one of Manhattan's infamous brothels.</p> <p><br/> The newly appointed police commissioner, Theodore Roosevelt, in a highly unorthodox move, enlists the two men in the murder investigation, counting on the reserved Kreizler's intellect and Moore's knowledge of New York's vast criminal underworld. They are joined by Sara Howard, a brave and determined woman who works as a secretary in the police department. Laboring in secret (for alienists, and the emerging discipline of psychology, are viewed by the public with skepticism at best), the unlikely team embarks on what is a revolutionary effort in criminology-- amassing a psychological profile of the man they're looking for based on the details of his crimes. Their dangerous quest takes them into the tortured past and twisted mind of a murderer who has killed before. and will kill again before the hunt is over.</p> <p><br/> Fast-paced and gripping, infused with a historian's exactitude,<i>The Alienist </i>conjures up the Gilded Age and its untarnished underside: verminous tenements and opulent mansions, corrupt cops and flamboyant gangsters, shining opera houses and seamy gin mills. Here is a New York during an age when questioning society's belief that all killers are born, not made, could have unexpected and mortal consequences.</p>",

Growing grapes since 1999, this family owned and operated winery has won numerous wine competition awards including recently top awards from the International Eastern Wine Competition. Winemakers Andrea and Nate O'Shea are California transplants who say they \"endeavor to make something that is approachable, fun, and enjoyable, so we say \"do what you love, drink what you like.\" There are outdoor picnic areas (bring a picnic, no food to be bought there) and lots of space for doggies to play. Make a day of it and hang out for a bit at the Winery and then maybe venture into Annapolis for an early dinner at one of the dog-friendly restaurants or just take a stroll on Annapolis' Main Street and down to the City Dock. We all love a good dog friendly winery, so mark your calendars and RSVP today!</p>",

Manga and Anime!!!!</p> <p>This Meetup is a work in progress.  We would love for you to be part of  creating our manga/anime family.  We would love for you to help us grow as a community.</p> <p><b>What is MangaTalk!</b></p> <p>MangaTalk is the Meetup to delve deeply into  the Japanese (and related) Graphic Novel and Video World that we are so passionate about with others who are equally passionate.  </p> <p>Please take the time to fill out the questions here on Meetup to help us create a Manga/Anime Club that speaks to you!  We will also have the survey at our 1st meeting, if you don't have time to fill it out here.  Then as a group, we will develop the content for the next meetup</p> <p>We will be discussing the rules of the Manga/Anime club.</p> <p><b>Drawing!</b></p> <p>We will set time aside in the first meeting for manga/anime drawing.  We just want to get a feel for whether drawing is going to be a part of our club, since so many people interested in Manga/Anime do have fun with fan-art or creating their own characters.     We will have art supplies available, so do not feel like you have to bring any, unless you want to.  Please, do not be intimidated by the art portion of our Meetup even if you are not an artist or are too shy to share your work.  Like all Meetups at Amazing Spiral, everyone is expected to treat each other's opinions and creative endeavors with kindness, consideration and respect.</p> <p>Please note that this is our first meetup too; we are getting to know you and you are getting to know us, so please don't be shy, bring your weirdness with you.   Bring in in CosPlay if you want!</p> <p>Again this is a place where you can be the otaku (FanBoy/FanGirl) you are or if you are just starting to get interested come and discover the Fun of Anime/Manga. </p> <p><br/><b>Just a caution for Younger Fans. </b></p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/7/3/5/600_434798709.jpeg\" /></p> <p><i>                                                        from Goldfish Warning!</i></p> <p>Warning there is some manga/anime that is not age appropriate for younger participants.  </p> <p>Manga and Anime are the fruits of a different culture and sometimes what would be considered \"All Ages\" by Japanese culture, is not what we in the States would consider All Ages.  If you are 12 and under, please bring a Parent/Guardian to your first meeting to give permission for you to be in a Meetup where the discussion/viewing may tap into more mature subjects of a Teen+ nature. </p> <p>\n\n\n\nLook for Spider-Man to find Amazing Spiral: Books, Comics, Toys, GAMES &amp; More!</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/c/e/600_339011982.jpeg\" /></p> <p>We are across from the Senator Theater and around the corner from Belvedere Square Market Shops.</p> <p>Ample parking in the back, on either side of our building, and on the street (there are meters and some no parking times on York Road.  Make sure you are compliant of the signs as there has been ticketing of street parkers who violate the laws)</p>",

      "description": "<p>Each meeting follows the Foundation for Shamanic Studies' general approach for teaching and building Core Shamanism and teaches journey techniques for all levels.  There is a discussion and topic presented with each class, and these themes are integrated into the journey work. If you are new to journeying, or are new to these classes, please come 15 minutes early (see below).</p> <p>There is lore within the Eddas as well that sheds light on how the shamanic path was treated historically in Europe. While this class supports any religion and faith, and requires tolerance to the diversity of religious traditions within cultures, it does have more of a focus on classic mystery traditions.</p> <p><br/>If you don't know how to journey, please contact Christian (xtian) in advance, although this step is not necessary. A brief introduction to journeying is available for beginners and experienced journeyers new to our group.  If so, please show up about 15 minutes early.</p> <p>This monthly journey group will help students of all levels build the divine connections to their teachers and/or power animals. Each session will consist of two journeys, and will allow a community to share questions and have structured feedback on how to improve your skills in journeying, as well as strengthen your subtle bodies for spiritual work no matter what your personal religious calling may be.</p> <p>$10 donation sliding scale is appreciated.  Donations support the group meetups and our larger community events!</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Notes on what you should bring, and requests:</b></p> <p>If you feel more comfortable lying down, bring a yoga mat or comfortable pad that you wish.</p> <p>If you have a rattle or shamanic drum that is not too loud, please do bring that.</p> <p>Bring a notebook and pen, or some thing to take notes on!</p> <p>Bring water for personal hydration.  Please try not to eat a very large meal immediately before the class. Heavy foods can interfere with this work, especially if spiritual work is new to you.  I do encourage a light snack however, as a starving student can be equally distracted.</p> <p>Finally, please be on time.  We will spend the first 15 minutes sharing and learning, and then begin our first journey.  If you do arrive once the journeying has begun, be quiet and respectful, and take the time to journey for yourself.</p> <p>Be respectful and turn off all cell phones and pagers during the event.</p>",

Everything is a path to our awakening. Come breathe yourself into the present moment and let go of the misery and shame keeping you from being more joyfully alive. Unlike many sacred traditions, Tantra uses our sexual energy as a powerful tool to expand. Learn to deepen your delight, open your heart and invite more ecstasy and bliss into your relationship with yourself and others. Find the transcendent in the body just waiting to be discovered. Sherry creates a safe, well boundaried and playful atmosphere as she shares simple techniques for greater intimacy, pleasure and spiritual opening.

This is a DOUBLEHEADER game. Your money is worth two games. The US will be playing Cuba  at 5:00 PM. Haiti will play Jamaica at 8:00 PM. Your ticket is valid for both games!! If you are American or if America has adopted you, this is your opportunity to wave your island’s flag and the Star-Spangled Banner back to back.</p> <p> Please note the schedule:</p> <p><br/>Saturday, July 18 at <b>5:00 PM</b> —&gt; United States vs Cuba</p> <p>Saturday, July 18th at <b>8:00 PM</b> —&gt; Haiti vs Jamaica</p> <p>Tickets can be purchased on Ticketmaster.com  by clicking on this link —&gt; <a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/concacaf-gold-cup-quarterfinals-baltimore-maryland-07-18-2015/event/15004E58C3EF3E1D\">Purchase CONCACAF 's Quarterfinal ticket</a></p> <p>Average ticket price is between $50 and $60 [USD, not Haitian dollar :) ] I would advise against buying tickets in the 400 or 500 level sections (these seats are too far).

      "description": "<p>This workshop will start with a foray into a local forest to collect some specimens. Local expert Michael Weese of <a href=\"http://mushroomlife.com/\">Mushoomlife</a> will give a brief “how-to” of wild mushroom hunting. Then we’ll break into groups and go looking for mushrooms. You’ll need to bring drinking water, a knife, small trowel, small-medium paper bags and be able to keep time so we don’t wander too far. After about a half hour of collecting we will regroup and caravan over to a local residence for a power point presentation on wild mushroom hunting, ethics, taxonomy, mycomedicinals, field guide interpretation and other wondrous facts about the 5th kingdom. Next we will apply our new knowledge by working with Michael to identify all the mushrooms we collected.</p> <p>Mushroom cultivating supplies will be for sale by Michael but is in limited supply. If you have specific requests email him at least one month prior to the workshop, follow the web link above for contact info.</p> <p>We will be doing a mushroom cultivation workshop later this year. That workshop will be hands on and full of tricky ways to use already available material to cultivate mushrooms as well as how to extend a kit you already have or start from a mushroom you found or purchased.</p> <p>Workshop Date: July 19, 9am-Noon        Cost: FULL      Participant maximum: 12<br/>Location: Sykesville/Eldersburg area       Instructor: Michael Weese</p> <p>\n\n\nWe will email you the exact meeting location shortly after we receive your paypal payment.</p>",

Their phone number is [masked]-5951. I would advise that you call and reserve a rental in advance. </p> <p><br/><b>If you want to drive up together in a carpool we will meet at the Mount Washington Light Rail Train Station promptly at 9:20am: 1501 Smith Avenue Baltimore MD 21209. </b>We will leave at 9:30am and will not wait for anyone. From there we should get to Monkton Bike Rental at about 10:05. I won't know who can carpool or not until we see who shows up. Be prepared to drive your own car up. Those meeting us at Monkton Bike Rental should show up at the same time. </p> <p>We can park our cars by the side of the road by Monkton Bike Rental, take care of tube rentals etc and then start walking out 25 minutes to our entry point on the Gunpowder River. The tubing downriver is about 2.5 hrs long but I'm sure we may stop a few times along the way. Then it's a short walk back to Monkton Bike Rental and our cars. Alternatively, there is a a shorter walk that will give you a tubing trip of about 1.5 hours but we will not be taking that one. It's tubing people - so we are out there to lounge around and have a good time. </p> <p>We will leave as soon as everyone who is present at the Bike Shop is ready to go. We will not wait for latecomers so please be on time. It's not fair to the entire group to wait on one person. </p> <p>Ok fun! Don't forget to bring food &amp; your own lunch, water, poop bags, leashes, dogs, tubes and any other appropriate gear with you. You are responsible for your party, dogs, and all of your stuff at all times. </p> <p><b>What's a good idea? </b></p> <p>- Bring / Rent tubes (sturdy... no flimsy ones... I've seen too many people try to bring pool tubes...they don't work)</p> <p>- Floatable cooler with rope, attach to tube... filled with a number of tasty beer and beverages. </p> <p>- Long and short leash... something to tie your dog to and allow him to swim. All other appropriate dog stuff.  Life jacket if needed.</p> <p>- Food and snacks in plastic waterproof bags. </p> <p>- Your sense of humor and fun. Smiles people! </p> <p>- A willing hand to help someone else out if they get stuck. </p> <p>- Waterproof sound system?  optional but nice addition. We really are just going to lounge on down the river.... </p> <p>- Swimming gear, just the essentials... no umbrellas or anything like that unless you somehow think you are going to carry that down the river. </p> <p>- Did I forget anything? </p> <p>Carol</p>",

      "description": "<p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/2/6/e/event_139181582.jpeg\" /></p> <p>One of the best kept secrets here just north of Towson is the public access to a \"protected\" area of Loch Raven Reservoir park on the weekend.  On both Saturday and Sunday, park police close off Loch Raven Drive (some maps call it Loch Raven Rd.) between Morgan Mill Road and Providence Road. The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.  In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.  The views of the water and the surrounding wooded areas are wonderful all year round.</p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.</p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.</p> <p> <b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.</b></p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.</p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation/Landing/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years) is located.  Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!</b> Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.</p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.</p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.  We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy/rock. </p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/7/8/8/event_139178792.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Loch Raven Drive is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.  That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.  However, I am not aware of any sanctioned, prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.  It would be free style.</p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.</b></p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\". That way, we know not to be waiting for you. Thanks.</b></p> <p>So come join us on Sunday for a brisk walk in the park. It's a great way to clean out the cobwebs and start a Sunday.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Enjoy a strenuous side of moderate hike approximately 7 miles in the Cunningham Falls State Park near Thurmont, MD. We will hike to, at least, 4 different overlooks. The overlooks include: Blue Ridge Summit Overlook, Thurmont Vista, Wolf Rock, Chimney Rock, and potentially Hog Rock (if everyone in the group is up for it). We will meet at the visitor center (14707 Park Central Road, Thurmont, MD. 21788) or (GPS coordinates: [masked], [masked]). The hike will likely take about 3 - 3.5 hours walking time. From the lowest elevation to the highest is around 700 feet, but there is some up and down along the hike so the total climb will be more. We will take plenty of brakes to make sure everyone stays together and is okay.</p> <p>The trails are rough and rocky throughout some of the hike. Some of the rock is loose. Make sure you are wearing sturdy hiking shoes and bring plenty of water. One quart of water is probably a good amount to bring. Hiking poles are worth bringing if you have them. The classification 'strenuous side of moderate' means it is a little more difficult than some of the other hikes the group does like Patapsco and Gunpowder. Some would term this as a transitional hike between moderate and strenuous. This group includes people with varying levels hiking endurance. If you are unsure if the level of difficulty is a match for your current abilities, please contact myself or one of the other hike leaders to help figure it out. We all are out here to have fun, first and foremost. Please make sure to leave early enough to arrive at 10 am. It doesn't feel good to miss the group after making the drive or delay the start of the hike a long time. I have done both. :( We will leave no later than 10:30. If you run into problems getting there, give a call.<br/>Dave E (cell -[masked])</p> <p>This is a fund raiser hike so we will charge $1.00/person.  The funds help pay for the meetup site fees.  No one's quitting there day jobs in this group. If you don't have the money when I ask about, just avoid eye contact.</p> <p>It's always a good idea to carpool on hiking meetups, since parking can sometimes be issue.  Feel free to use the chat below to organize a carpool with fellow hikers.</p> <p>Dogs are welcome on this hike.  Park policy requires the dogs be kept on a leash.</p>",

It's OK to bring friends.</p> <p>Has the healthcare industry missed the target? Because of exploding disease rates, healthcare spending is growing unsustainably. Recent evidence suggests another future is possible for the planet and for each of us. Dr. Adams will summarize the scientific evidence behind a whole food diet, explain the famous “China Study,” address controversies, share practical tips and answer questions in a talk that may inspire you toward vibrant health (or at least provide some great recipes). Sunday, July 19th 2015 at 10:30am<br/>At the Baltimore Ethical Society, 306 W Franklin St., Baltimore.</p> <p>At 10:30 am there will be brief announcements, followed by the 50 minute presentation, followed by Q &amp; A and an opportunity to socialize over snacks and coffee. Free of charge.</p>",

R2C is a powerful process and is often the best option for clients who need to locate the root of their problem. Using Regression to Cause gives the hypnotherapist an advantage over typical talk therapist methodologies. Often the client does not know the source of their internal conflict. Regression to Cause gives direct access to the root of the problem and helps the hypnotist guide the client to resolution and healing. This meeting will also address when to use Regression to Cause, what the concerns often identified about using it with clients (i.e., false memories, re-traumatizing clients, etc.).</p>",

Yet  the very technology designed for our well-being often serves only to isolate us from one another and distance us from the experience of all that is truly divine.</p> <p><br/>The Bhakti Lounge is a place where incredible transformation and healing takes place all through the culture of bhakti. Meditation, Kirtan, Discussions on the Bhagavad Gita and other ancient texts from the Vedic tradition , Vegetarian food prepared using Bhakti &amp; Ayurvedic principles create an environment where lifelong friendships are made. As one yogi remarked\" I finally found a  community of kindred spirits\"</p> <p><br/>We meet every Sunday on 200 Bloomsbury Avenue Catonsville, MD from 6 pm to 8 pm.

That is 12 performances for the price of one.<br/>-Priority member seating (must call or email office one week prior to show date to reserve)<br/>-Complimentary tickets to Young Actors’ Studio productions<br/>-Invitations to opening night receptions<br/>10% off theater classes and summer camps. The[masked] season will include:</p> <p>1. The Rose Play Festival - A Celebration of Women<br/>by Various Playwrights<br/>September 11 - 27, 2015</p> <p>As an invited guest of the Women’s Voices Play Festival in Washington D.C., Compass Rose will fully produce a new play by a woman playwright to be held during this new play festival for the fall of 2015. Other offerings will include staged readings of other new works and a performance of Twelfth Night, by William Shakespeare performed by the Young Actors’ Studio of Compass Rose Theater.</p> <p>2. Brigadoon<br/>by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe<br/>November 6 - December[masked]</p> <p>Emerging from the mists of Scotland just once in a century is the town of Brigadoon, a place of wonderment and adventure. This love story beguiles us as it leads two American travellers into the world of long ago. There is danger and darkness in this place out of time, but love abides in the end. The outstanding score by Lerner and Loewe thrilled Broadway audiences long ago and will now grace the Compass Rose stage, with its tribute to simplicity, true love, and goodness.</p> <p>3. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof<br/>by Tennessee Williams<br/>January 22 - February[masked]</p> <p>This steamy southern drama, filled with characters whose lives are torn with passion and lies won a Pulitzer Prize and was one of Tennessee Williams favorite plays. From the cat-like Maggie, the repressed Brick, with his latent longings, to the shadows of Big Daddy and Big Mama, this powerful story twists and turns our hearts and stirs our own longings. Come with us as we inhabit their world and watch it explode.</p> <p>4. Diary of Anne Frank<br/>by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett<br/>March 18 - April[masked]</p> <p>A simple diary discovered after World War II shares the inmost thoughts and wishes of a young girl, Anne Frank, penned up in an attic hiding from the Nazis. The story is too real, too poignant to be fiction. This Pulitzer Prize and Tony award winning play not only shares a young girl’s life during wartime, but also explores the longings and dreams of all young girls. Innocence and youthful spirit are unquenched by circumstance, as Anne still discovers the world looking at the sky through a crack in the roof. This play is rich drama, because we laugh as well as cry, knowing that life even at its hardest can still be lightened by humor.</p> <p>5. Roar of the Greasepaint, Smell of the Crowd - A Musical<br/>by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley<br/>May 6 - June[masked]</p> <p>An upper class gent and a lower class commoner compete for the top of the heap in this play contest of wills. Add a band of rowdy urchins and this un-story dances into our hearts. Running on Broadway in the late nineteen sixties, this play is less a story than an allegory. Featuring such hit songs as “Who Can I Turn to” and “Feeling Good” this play is a circus romp of good and bad, up and down. Let us entertain you, and enjoy the ride.</p>",

The Scenarios for Adventure 1 and Adventure 3 are also available at the store and can be run by anyone with a copy of the core card game and the relevant Adventure Deck numbers. If you can bring a core game please list that with your RSVP so we can expand the number of player seats.</i></b></p> <p><b>Adventure 0-2 - A Pirate's Life</b></p> <p>Yo ho! A pirate’s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there’s more to a pirate’s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what’s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate’s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain’s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.</p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that’s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there’s power, there’s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You’ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you’ll attract a host of powerful enemies.</p> <p>If you can’t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won’t ask questions. They’ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet. </p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can’t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there’s chum in the water, you’ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you’re eager to earn her patronage, then you’d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.</p> <p><br/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:</b></p> <p>1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play, as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we are sure we have space for, but if there is more interest, we can almost certainly make more room. So please sign up for the wait list if you want to play.</p> <p>3.

Second loop might get dark near the end, but there will be a bail point before that at mile 5. Bring something bright enough to see! Here's a few links of lights I have bought: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Generic-Bicycle-Taillight-Light-Headlight/dp/B006Y1FK18/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1408622459&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=cree+bike+light\">Click Here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/SecurityIng%C2%AE-Headlight-Headlamp-Bicycle-Packaging/dp/B009QX8B2Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1408622459&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=cree+bike+light\">Here</a></p> <p>Meeting near playground, when entering the main driveway, make a left, keep going until you see a building, which are the bathrooms.</p> <p>Please comment on what time you will be attending when you RSVP</p> <p>Video of Fairland from a couple of years ago, first loops tends to be like the video:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0pq6ygIbw\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0pq6ygIbw</a></p> <p>About Fairland: 95% non-technical ride with few major climbs and no mandatory obstacles (they all have ride-arounds). Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.</p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate/Fast:</p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!</p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):</p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us. Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.</p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.</p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.</p> <p>What to bring:</p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.</p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!( <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/MVDMountainBikers/about/comments/?op=all\">Here</a> )</p>",

      "description": "<p><b>Title</b> - From Zero to Loading a Data Warehouse<br/> \n<b>Abstract</b> - You're tasked to create the ETL process for a brand-new data warehouse. Where do you start? Data warehouse ETL boils down to three specific problems: Staging, Dimensions, and Facts. This session will show you solutions to these three problems. You'll first learn the fundamentals of a data warehouse before diving into creating packages and leveraging common patterns. You'll see both simple and advanced scenarios such as incrementally loading staging tables, processing type1 and type2 slowly changing dimensions, early arriving facts, snapshot fact tables, and bridge tables. If you want to create scalable and efficient SSIS packages to load a data warehouse, this session is for you.</p> <p><b>Speaker</b> - Samuel Vanga</p> <p><b>Sponsor</b> - <a href=\"http://rd.gt/1x5Mx7O\">Red-Gate</a></p>",

Pull out the drain plug, and the dirty water disappears. Most of us give little thought to the hidden systems that bring us water and take it away when we’re done with it. But these underappreciated marvels of engineering face an array of challenges that cannot be solved without a fundamental change to our relationship with water, David Sedlak explains in this enlightening book. </p> <p><br/>To make informed decisions about the future, we need to understand the three revolutions in urban water systems that have occurred over the past 2,500 years and the technologies that will remake the system. </p> <p>The author starts by describing Water 1.0, the early Roman aqueducts, fountains, and sewers that made dense urban living feasible. He then details the development of drinking water and sewage treatment systems—the second and third revolutions in urban water. He offers an insider’s look at current systems that rely on reservoirs, underground pipe networks, treatment plants, and storm sewers to provide water that is safe to drink, before addressing how these water systems will have to be reinvented. </p> <p>For everyone who cares about reliable, clean, abundant water, this book is essential reading.</p>",

      "description": "<p><b>What:</b> In this special session, we will have a guided meditation followed by a discussion about the future of the community. You will have a chance to meet new teacher Stan Eisenstein, who will discuss his background. Stan and Mira will put forward their vision of the community going forward. And you will have a chance to express your wishes and concerns, as well as to ask questions.</p> <p><b>When and where:</b> We meet <b>every Tuesday from 7:00-8:30 p.m</b>. at <b>Baltimore Yoga Village in the Mount Washington</b> area of Baltimore. Please arrive early to settle into your seats - we start right at 7:00 p.m.</p> <p>We practice Insight Meditation, a style of meditation that helps the mind attain deeper levels of calm concentration through sustained attention on the breath, then combines this with the crucial aspect of insight through contemplation of the mind and body and all of their changing and impermanent senses, emotions and thoughts. Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.</p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.</p> <p><b>Teaching Schedule:</b></p> <p>6/23 Mira     6/30 Mira    </p> <p>7/7  Mira      7/14  Stan     7/21  Stan      7/28  Stan</p> <p>8/4  Stan       8/11  Stan     8/18  Mira     8/25  Stan</p> <p><b>Teachers:</b></p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein</b>, a former high school physics teacher who has been meditating for 30 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.

The weekly report (issued on Wednesdays) includes which plants are up, ripe, or in the correct stage for harvesting in the Baltimore/Annapolis/DC area, as well as some basic information such as Latin &amp; common names, which part part of the plant is edible now, where it commonly grows, and some basic nutritional information. The report includes wild edible greens, shoots, roots, tubers, stalks, berries, fungi, nuts, &amp; seeds, and is intended to be a complement to other study on wild edible plants, whether through classes or independent research. The report does notinclude detailed identification guidance, or details on processing, cooking, or preserving wild plants. For in-depth learning through classes or workshops on foraging, processing, cooking, or medicine making with wild plants, please visit Charm City Farm's other programming.</p> <p>The report runs March 18- Dec 16, for a total of 40 issues. Subscribers can join at any time throughout the year. Subscription is $10 per email address.</p> <p>The Charm City Farms Forage Report is authored by Victoria Greba, a Baltimore based nature instructor specializing in the use of wild plants.</p> <p>To view a sample report and to subscribe please visit <a href=\"http://www.charmcityfarms.org/foragers-of-baltimore/subscribe-to-charm-city-farms-forage-report/\"><a href=\"http://www.charmcityfarms.org/foragers-of-baltimore/subscribe-to-charm-city-farms-forage-report/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.charmcityfarms.org/foragers-of-baltimore/subscribe-to-charm-city-farms-forage-report/</a></a></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/8/0/0/event_435870720.jpeg\" /></p>",

Wheels rolling by 6:00. We will not wait past 6:00.  </p> <p><b>Pace:</b> Pace will be Intermediate, approx. 6.5 to 7 mph. Appropriate for average to riders, but not for beginners, or people who are not riding at least once a week.  Attitude is laid-back and friendly, but please ensure you can handle the pace and length of this ride before committing. This is a no-drop ride, i.e., we wait up for everyone at intersections. (Note: if you don’t want to wait up for slower riders, this is NOT the ride for you, but please also survey your current fitness, as no one likes to be the one person holding up a larger group).  Please also note Ptap rides tend to be about 1 mph slower than Rosy, or Fairland, due terrain.  </p> <p><b>Terrain:</b> Ranges from Easy to Difficult. Most trails are in great shape, but plan on some mud spots. There are a few very steep climbs, rocks and technical sections, log overs (up to 10\" logs, and 3' stacks), tight single track (12\" wide in spots), and a stream crossing or two.  A strong/advanced rider will be able to clean most sections, others will need to get off of their bikes in spots.  This is a friendly ride, so we will wait up for everyone, just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places.  This is a video edit I made from last fall through winter.  We won't hit all of this terrain, but gives you a feel for Patapsco:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M</a></p> <p><b>Distance:</b> With days getting longer we will be minimally getting 10 miles, and if conditions and light allow, we will push towards 20.  Exact route will change depending on group dynamics, trail conditions, daylight, etc.  I will typically have route planned in my head at the beginning of the ride, but will modify as needed to get us back at a reasonable time.  </p> <p><b>Duration:</b> I shoot to have us back before it gets dark (so 2 to 3 hours as the days get longer).  This can change with mechanical issues, and group dynamics though.  As this is a weekday ride, the stops will be just long enough for the last rider to catch their breath.  Note: wheels roll at stated time, so please don’t be late.</p> <p><b>Bring:</b> Helmet (required), water (as much as you can carry), spare tube/patch kit, pump/CO2, multi-tool, I.D., emergency contact info where it can be easily located on your person, and a good attitude, as this ride is as much about camaraderie as it is about riding. Take a look at your bike and make sure it is in good working condition (Ptap will take its toll on the bike).  Bring a light, as you might need it.  There are ton of acceptable lights under $20 on Amazon right now.  Just look for a T6 Cree LED Bike light, with minimially 1000 lumens.  Here is a link to one: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Y1FK18/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">Cheap 1000 lumen bike light</a>&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006QQX3C4/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=3FJIG6WZ09712&amp;coliid=I15GIMB04YOTYI\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p><b>Weather:</b> Shine Only (there will undoubtedly be some mud, but no ride if it’s raining or the trails are too muddy). Protect our trails and don’t ride them when they’re fragile. There may be days where I make a last minute call, so watch this page and our Facebook group on days where there is a chance of rain.</p> <p><b>Ride Organizer</b>(s): Craig P.</p> <p><br/>Craig P, 443-8four5-threesix89; skibum616 at yahoo dot com</p>",

      "description": "<p>Private Event! This event is in my home so please only RSVP if I have met you at a prior event.</p> <p>• Baltimore &amp; Ohio is a no luck, no auctions, 3+ hour, grand strategic economic slugfest of a train game, for 3-6 players.</p> <p>• America's first steam locomotive moves down the steel rails of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad in Baltimore in 1830. This strategic railroad game extends from the first of America's railroads through the golden age of steam, where pioneering rail barons knit together the fledgling United States with iron roads, realizing the full power of the nation's mighty heartland. Each player takes the roles of railroad presidents and their wealthy investors, betting that their capital gambles will pay off handsomely. Baltimore and Ohio is not a game of luck or chance, but a competitive struggle of wits, savvy and guile. With the resources at hand, should you focus on further expansion, technological breakthroughs or emerging markets?</p> <p><br/><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghLb59aNPvk\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghLb59aNPvk</a></p> <p><br/><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN_DyRIkCxQ\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN_DyRIkCxQ</a></p>",

The alimentary canal is classic Mary Roach terrain: the questions inspired by our insides are as taboo, in their way, as the cadavers in Stiff and every bit as surreal as the universe of zero gravity explored in Packing for Mars. Why is crunchy food so appealing? Why is it so hard to find names for flavors and smells? Why doesn’t the stomach digest itself? How much can you eat before your stomach bursts? Can constipation kill you? Did it kill Elvis? We meet scientists who tackle the questions no one else thinks—or has the courage—to ask. And we go on location to a pet-food taste-test lab, a bacteria transplant, and into a live stomach to observe the fate of a meal.</p> <p>Like all of Roach’s books, Gulp is as much about human beings as it is about human bodies.</p> <p>\n\n\nReview courtesy of Goodreads:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13615414-gulp?from_search=true&amp;search_version=legacy\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13615414-gulp?from_search=true&amp;search_version=legacy</a></p>",

When I read <i>The Fault in Our Stars</i>, I was the first of my friends to read it, and then by the time everyone else had read it, the movie was coming out, and I didn't get a chance to talk about the book with anyone because they were all focused on the movie. I was bummed. I know <i>Looking for Alaska</i> by John Green (in case you didn't know) is being made into a movie, but I wanted to read a John Green novel and have a discussion about it, and what better novel than his debut!</p> <p>From Amazon.com: Miles “Pudge” Halter is done with his safe life at home. His whole life has been one big non-event, and his obsession with famous last words has only made him crave “the Great Perhaps” even more (Francois Rabelais, poet). He heads off to the sometimes crazy and anything-but-boring world of Culver Creek Boarding School, and his life becomes the opposite of safe. Because down the hall is Alaska Young. The gorgeous, clever, funny, sexy, self-destructive, screwed up, and utterly fascinating Alaska Young. She is an event unto herself. She pulls Pudge into her world, launches him into the Great Perhaps, and steals his heart. Then. . . . After. Nothing is ever the same.</p> <p>Can't wait for this one!</p>",

      "description": "<p><b>*** If you are attending this practice, please don't forget to sign up on <a href=\"http://www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com\">our website</a> by clicking the \"Sign Up\" link at the top. ***</b></p> <p>The BDBC open practices occur every Wednesday from 6:15 to 7:30 PM and Saturday mornings from 8:30 to 9:30. For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:</p> <p><br/>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.</p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.</p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.</p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.</p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car/on land.</p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.</p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun! More information can be found at &lt;a&gt;www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com.&lt;/a&gt; Hope to see you there!</p>",

      "description": "<p>For 8 successive Wednesdays, there is a guided history tour on the Torrey C. Brown Rail Trail, which I think most of us know as the NCR Trail. Each tour will cover the specific history of both the trail and the surrounding area of the stated location. Each tour starts at the indicated NCR stop and \"bites off\" roughly 10 miles for that evening. What a great way to eventually experience the entire trail in bite size portions. The Maryland Park Service volunteer in Monkton couldn't stop praising this series when I asked her about it. The leader is a \"local\" who is very passionate about the history of his \"hometown\". There is no charge.</p> <p><b>Just to be VERY clear. This event(s) is open to the general public; it is not dedicated to this Meetup group. We are not the ones in charge of the start time; the Guide is.

This class focuses on variations, holds, and beginner to intermediate postures.</p> <p>Each class is 90 minutes in length.</p> <p>The Sivananda style of yoga is ideal for individuals who are looking to take charge of their health and make a deeper connection to yoga in pursuit of mind and body perfection.</p> <p>The practice emphasizes concentration, meditation, relaxation, pranayama (breathing), and asanas (postures) at a more controlled pace – without focusing on physical aerobic exercise and continuous flowing movements like other yoga styles – with the same health and well-being benefits.</p> <p><b>You can find out more about my style of yoga at <a href=\"http://www.ashishyoga.com\">www.ashishyoga.com</a></b></p> <p>To reserve a spot for this class, please click here: <a href=\"https://v1.bookwhen.com/ashishyoga\"><a href=\"https://v1.bookwhen.com/ashishyoga\" class=\"linkified\">https://v1.bookwhen.com/ashishyoga</a></a></p>",

      "description": "<p><b>What:</b> This is an open ongoing mindfulness meditation group for both beginners and experienced practitioners.</p> <p>While the forms of meditation we practice are rooted in Buddhist teachings, the study and practice of mindfulness and insight meditation is applicable to anyone from any background or religion, and all are welcome.</p> <p><i>These teachings are available to all. Although a $5-$10 donation is suggested, donations are not required for attendance.</i></p> <p><br/><b>Each class will include:</b> guided meditation, instruction, opportunities to practice, and time for discussion, questions and answers.</p> <p><b>When and where:</b> We meet every Tuesday from 7:30-9:00 p.m. at Centennial High School, 4300 Centennial Lane, Ellicott City, MD, 21042, room 406. Please arrive early to settle into your seats - we start right at 7:30 p.m.</p> <p><b>We practice Insight Meditation</b>, a style of meditation that helps the mind attain deeper levels of calm concentration through sustained attention on the breath, then combines this with the crucial aspect of insight through contemplation of the mind and body and all of their changing and impermanent senses, emotions and thoughts. Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.</p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.</p> <p><b>Teacher:</b></p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein</b>, a high school physics teacher who has been meditating for 25 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004. Stan is a mentor with the Insight Meditation Community of Washington (IMCW) and is a graduate of the Meditation Teacher Training Institute, a two-year certification program with senior Insight teachers Tara Brach, Jonathan Foust, Hugh Byrne, and Pat Coffey. He also teaches Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Stan also earned a Masters of Social Work in 1998.</p> <p><br/><b>Location: Oakland Manor Town Center (TC) Room.<br/></b></p> <p>Park anywhere in the Oakland Manor Parking lot.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.</p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.</p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.</p> <p><br/>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.</p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.</p> <p>6. The group is not recommended for those under age 13.</p> <p>Please feel free to contact Stan Eisenstein at [masked] if you have any questions.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p>",

Dr. Gridlock will be our honored guest.<b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Dr. Gridlock will navigate you through the twists and turns he's encountered on the ever-evolving social media highway.</b></p> <p><br/>(The history is that the Dr. Gridlock Twitter account has evolved, using several different approaches, many of which involve flying blind. Should it be a neutral feed, with links to stories and blog postings? Should it do that plus offer commentary and links to other people's good stories?</p> <p><br/>Still, they've managed to build up 25,000 followers.)</p> <p><b>Speaker: Robert Thomson - @drgridlock</b></p> <p>Robert Thomson is The Washington Post’s \"Dr. Gridlock.\" He answers travelers’ questions, listens to their complaints and shares their pain on the roads, trains and buses in the Washington region. In addition to his twice-weekly newspaper column, he writes a daily blog on The Post’s Web site, engages readers in online chats and presents features about transportation issues on The Post’s Sunday Commuter page.</p> <p>Thomson has been a reporter, editor and columnist for more than 40 years in New York and Washington. He joined The Post in 1988. In 1999, he became The Post’s transportation editor. When Ron Shaffer, founder of \"Dr. Gridlock,\" retired from The Post in 2006, Thomson took over the column. (He enjoys getting out of the office to play in traffic.)</p> <p>Thomson was born in New York City, and grew up in New York, Honolulu, Montreal and El Paso. He graduated from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, with a bachelor’s degree in political science.</p> <p>He and his wife, Candy, spokeswoman for the Maryland Natural Resources Police, live in Silver Spring.</p> <p><b>Please RSVP by Tuesday, July 21st, to be included in the door prize drawings.</b></p> <p>As always the first hour (starting at 5 p.m.) is social networking and the formal event starts promptly at 6 p.m.</p> <p><br/>Looking forward to seeing you later this month.</p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>Gene (@gdeems), John (@eyeonannapolis) and Josh (@jdavidsburg)</p>",

I was recently told Jeff Young, the founding father of the MD Chapter of the AMTA, used to say, \"At any given time, there is a new client 10 feet away from us\". Isn't that true when we are out and about? It's called networking. We have the privilege of having another founding father of one of the biggest business networking organizations in the state of Maryland, speak with us about what it means for our business/practice to network. His name is Jerry Schwartz. Jerry is one of the most positive, nicest and unstoppable people I know! He assisted us, myself and Bill Pearce, in establishing the Downtown Chapter of BNI, Business Networking International, back in the late 90's. After we got going, I doubled my income through this illustrious group of businessmen and women. Jerry has agreed to share the wealth of why and how networking is so vital to building our massage practices. Also, if you are hungry, \"Jokers n Thieves\" has a really delicious and eclectic menu. I just ate there for the first time and EVERYTHING was so yummy! Hope you can make it! </p> <p>~ Peace &amp; Prosperity ~</p> <p>Michael E. Campbell, LMT, LWC</p>",
