I'm sure you've asked some version of that question.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0So I started this group for answers!<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Boston Black Queers - B.B.Q and Friends, is a meetup group for Black Womyn, in their late twenties to early forties, that identify as a member of the LGBTQ community, plus our friends and allies, living, working and playing in and around the Boston Area. While our events are all inclusive, this group will be a safe space to recognize and celebrate the African Diaspora and the variety of cultures and identities we represent. With that being said, this group is by no means exclusive to Boston, Black Womyn or Queers; after all, what\u2019s a BBQ without friends?!?!<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n The goal is to build a community that may start on meetup.com, but that goes beyond the cyber connection. Looking for something to do with like-minded Womyn? Have a variety of interests? Want to meet other QWOC? If you answered yes to ANY of the above questions, please join us! The group is nothing without active members, so don't hesitate to attend, host an event, take\/post photos and utilize our discussion board, so we can make this what we want it to be! As we grow, I'd love to add a few additional organizers so let me know if you're interested!<\/p>\n<p>Guidelines:<br>\n\n Any member can host a meetup without organizer's permission. BBQ's are great when the weather permits, but of course, the more options we have, the better: Boozey Brunches, dinner, concerts, drinks, museums, art festivals, road trips, karaoke, bowling, paint parties, exercise\/dance classes, weekend getaways, comedy shows, wine tastings, discussions, wellness activities, put lucks, dancing, the possibilities really are endless! Don\u2019t hesitate to host a meetup, just be sure to attend if you are the Host.<\/p>\n<p>Please update your RSVP to all meetups. It\u2019s okay to change your mind at any point. Things can come up, but once you know you can\u2019t make it or that you can, just take a moment to update your RSVP, or note it in the comments. As host, it\u2019s nice to have an accurate attendee count.<\/p>\n<p>Use the Discussion Boards if you have ideas for meetups, so anyone that\u2019s interested in hosting can see what other members would like to do. Again, please be as detailed as possible. Looking forward to getting to know you all and starting 2015 right, with you!<\/p>","lon":-71.0800018311,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/d\/7\/highres_434720951.jpeg","photo_id":434720951,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/d\/7\/600_434720951.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/d\/7\/thumb_434720951.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10929644,"name":"Anita"},"members":50,"name":"Boston Black Queers and Friends (B.B.Q + Friends)","id":18269082,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Black-Queers-and-Friends-B-B-Q-Friends","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":42.3699989319,"who":"B.B.Queers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1419291813000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"reading","name":"Reading","id":15360},{"urlkey":"readers","name":"Readers","id":17219},{"urlkey":"book-club-movies","name":"Book Club, Movies","id":19594},{"urlkey":"small-groups-book-club-discuss-issues","name":"Small Groups - Book Club, Discuss Issues","id":21356},{"urlkey":"books-and-drinks","name":"Books and Drinks","id":38966}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/National-Geographic-Magazine-Book-Club\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This group is for those who regularly read the current monthly issue of National Geographic. &nbsp;On the fourth Thursday of each month, we will meet to discuss the topics covered in the current month's National Geographic magazine.

Signing up for an event is a comitment to show up and put effort in so typical meetup flakiness is not expected in thus group.","lon":-71.1600036621,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":6602385,"name":"Chris L"},"members":6,"name":"Somerville area Singles 30s-40s adventuresome cooking club","id":18286865,"state":"MA","urlname":"Somerville-area-Singles-30s-40s-adventuresome-cooking-club","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":42.4199981689,"who":"Adventurous single cooks"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Chestnut Hill","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1420087508000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"how-to-pass-the-cpa-exam","name":"How to Pass the CPA Exam","id":22288},{"urlkey":"cpa-exam","name":"CPA Exam","id":23653},{"urlkey":"cfa-exam-preparation","name":"CFA Exam Preparation","id":50568},{"urlkey":"cpa-candidates","name":"CPA Candidates","id":88541},{"urlkey":"accounting-students","name":"Accounting Students","id":126147},{"urlkey":"cpa-exam-study","name":"CPA Exam Study","id":144547}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-How-to-Pass-the-CPA-Exam-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"We will study together to pass the CPA exam.","lon":-71.1600036621,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":183227052,"name":"Rob"},"members":10,"name":"Boston- How to Pass the CPA Exam Meetup","id":18287271,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-How-to-Pass-the-CPA-Exam-Meetup","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":42.3199996948,"who":"CPA Candidates"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Reading","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1420116378000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"gparenting","name":"Raising Grandchildren","id":1337},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"grandparents","name":"Grandparents","id":10351},{"urlkey":"grandparents-network","name":"Grandparents Network","id":46202},{"urlkey":"grandparents-club","name":"Grandparents Club","id":46203},{"urlkey":"stay-at-home-grandparents","name":"Stay at Home Grandparents","id":46520},{"urlkey":"single-grandparents","name":"Single Grandparents","id":55172},{"urlkey":"grandmothers-caring-for-grandkids","name":"Grandmothers Caring for Grandkids","id":62102},{"urlkey":"grandmas-taking-care-of-their-grandchildren","name":"Grandma's Taking Care of their Grandchildren","id":87052},{"urlkey":"grandparents-watching-their-grandchildren","name":"Grandparents Watching their Grandchildren","id":125841},{"urlkey":"youthful-active-grandmothers","name":"Youthful active Grandmother's.","id":148797},{"urlkey":"grandparents-joys-and-challenges-raising-grandkids","name":"Grandparents Joys and Challenges Raising Grandkids","id":156182},{"urlkey":"joys-of-raising-grandchildren","name":"Joys of raising grandchildren","id":663332},{"urlkey":"bonding-with-you-grandchildren","name":"Bonding with you Grandchildren","id":741142}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Reading-Grandmothers-Caring-for-Grandkids-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"This is a group for Nonna's, Grandma's, Grammies, Nanna's..etc who are taking care of their grandchildren and would like to meet up for playdates and activities.

These events are FREE and appropriate for children up to 6 years. <br> <\/p>\n<p>Previously, I was a part of a great hiking group closer to Boston that met every week.

No stroller hikes unless specified in the details of the hike. Please dress appropriately for the weather and terrain with layers, appropriate footwear, hats, sunscreen and water. Be prepared for ice, mud, scorching heat and\/or brisk winds! This is New England after all; though I don't expect them all in one hike.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We stroll at a slower pace to allow the children to soak up the environment, caregivers can chat with a new friend and we'll try to keep the group relatively close together. Our trail will be short and simple so you are free to take another loop around. Also, if your little one's pace is REALLY slow (I was once in that group) you can linger on the first trail in and we'll meet up with you on the way out.<br> <\/p>\n<p>Remember, we're kid friendly. We're all parents and caregivers doing our best to enjoy the outdoors with young children. The trails are selected for ease of walking and are short enough for the young ones to endure.&nbsp; We'll take breaks and spend plenty of time playing in leaves or snow, rolling over logs to check for bugs and skipping stones..... all things our kids should be doing and this is great place for it.<\/p>\n<p>Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

Would you benefit from open, frank conversations with men and women your own age, about tips and methods of finding the mate you are seeking? Stop struggling in the dating scene and start enjoying it, from a wise, confident, intentional, approach that helps you recognize what you are really seeking, and how to take more beneficial actions towards your goal, and to spend less dead-end time and energy on efforts that lead you away from your goal.<\/p>","lon":-71.1100006104,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/0\/0\/highres_433516896.jpeg","photo_id":433516896,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/0\/0\/600_433516896.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/0\/0\/thumb_433516896.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":140541992,"name":"Val\u00e9rie Boudreau"},"members":99,"name":"Merrimack Valley 40+ Dating Workshop & Fun!","id":18339593,"state":"MA","urlname":"mv-dating","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":42.6899986267,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1421351709000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"innovation","name":"Innovation","id":1954},{"urlkey":"networkmarket","name":"Network Marketing","id":2532},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/WeWork-Boston-Events\/","rating":0,"description":"We transform regular buildings into beautiful, collaborative workspaces designed to create a thriving community amongst the thousands of entrepreneurs that we house.

Have you ever toyed with the idea of starting a side business that you could possibly grow into a full time career\/life passion?<\/p>\n<p>Consider this group your built in sisterhood community + playdate generator for your children + business strategy think tank! Mompreneurs are juggling a lot and the energy of mother entrepreneurs coming together with their children in a community of sisterhood support is a POWERFUL FORCE! Meetups can include brainstorming sessions, ideas for work life balance, creative time management strategies (especially managing our KIDS!), raising capital, marketing plans, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My name is Felicia, I am founder of the Mompreneur Soul and have built this FREE community to give Mompreneurs everywhere the space to bridge motherhood and entrepreneurship, a thing that is not easy to find! You can find out more about my business here at&nbsp;<a>www.mompreneursoul.com.<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>A Little About My Background<\/p>\n<p>Over the course of my career I have noticed how most of my female peers, particularly mothers, were missing from top leadership positions across the corporate environment but were showing up in huge numbers as owners of small home based businesses. I began to question my own career and life decisions when I started a family and began to realize that there is far more to living a \"successful\" life than just earning a bigger salary and capturing a corner office, and that as a mother, that all came at a hefty price. In the midst of the American epidemic of career burnout, stress-related illnesses and erosion of family life, I started to question how mothers could be better supported in their struggle to allow both their business leadership and motherhood roles to coexist and simultaneously thrive.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The result was years of doctoral research aimed at understanding the Mompreneur phenomenon, a recent societal trend where mothers are choosing to leave behind either a full time corporate career or a full time stay at home mom career for small business ownership. It became clear to me after years of interviews with mother-entrepreneurs across the country that these women were discovering a \u201cloophole\u201d to the mainstream career issues that plagued mothers for decades. Whether they had left behind a career as a corporate executive or they had been a stay at home mom for years and wanted to re-start a career, I noticed the common thread for these Mompreneur women was that they got what their soul was craving: the ability to simultaneously be a mom and have a career on their own terms, without sacrificing one for the other. These women confessed it wasn't an easy road to take, but at the end of the day they called the shots, they had more freedom to decide when they worked on the business or spending time with their children and they chose businesses that put their life passion and purpose at the center.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;My question then was how could I help power moms everywhere stuck in the fear and dysfunction of the mainstream career matrix successfully transition into entrepreneurship, and how could I help corporations who were losing these valuable savvy women leaders foster a healthier culture and environment to better retain and empower them. The answer to this question was the birth of Mompreneur Soul, a consulting firm aimed at nurturing a women\u2019s journey through motherhood and business leadership and entrepreneurship. My background includes being a mother, corporate executive, entrepreneur, business professor, certified career coach, and Kundalini yoga and meditation teacher, and my life work and passion is to revolutionize how our culture, our workplace and business leaders everywhere re-think motherhood and leadership, and how mothers can infuse soul into their families, careers and businesses.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.0500030518,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/9\/b\/highres_433857755.jpeg","photo_id":433857755,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/9\/b\/600_433857755.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/9\/b\/thumb_433857755.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11310777,"name":"Felicia Newhouse"},"members":112,"name":"Mompreneur Soul Productive Playdates","id":18399943,"state":"MA","urlname":"MompreneurSoul","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Mompreneurs"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1422746234000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"nondrinker","name":"Alcohol-Free","id":7174},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"recovery-and-fellowship","name":"Recovery and Fellowship","id":15136},{"urlkey":"support-group","name":"Support Group","id":15275},{"urlkey":"healing","name":"Healing","id":16151},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"support-and-recovery","name":"Support and Recovery","id":17966},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"sober","name":"Sober","id":26144},{"urlkey":"sobriety","name":"Sobriety","id":46198},{"urlkey":"sober-activities","name":"Sober Activities","id":46200},{"urlkey":"alcohol-and-drug-free","name":"Alcohol and Drug Free","id":68373}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Soba-Yoga-Yoga-For-Recovery\/","rating":5,"description":"Looking for some fun and healthy sober activities in Boston that also help you along in recovery?

There is nothing wrong with such groups and companies, but there is no need for another group to do the same &nbsp;as they do. &nbsp;The goal for this group to fill a different \"niche\", to be different from the others. &nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>The goal is for this group to be different in:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1. Adventurous trips, whether in the U S or abroad. But that's not all we are, Some other groups do that, read on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2. This is NOT a for-profit group. I, the founder and original organizer, am not seeking any compensation for trips or otherwise.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3. It is my concept that unlike some other groups, the \"organizer\" of a trip will not go for free, subsidized by increasing the costs of others. &nbsp;I do not criticize other groups that work that way, I have been on some wonderful trips with some, but I'm going to experiment with this group being different.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4. While the organizer of a trip will not go for free, it is my goal\/hope that many others who participate in an event will share the planning. Perhaps one person will investigate air fares, another where to stay, another what to do there, etc. Time will tell if this works out. The work to be done by any one person may be as minimal as making a phone call to an airline, calling a hostel, or a few minutes research on the internet. &nbsp;It's very little work if spread out, but a lot of work for one person to do by themselves.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>5. There is no minimal threshhold for how adventurous the trip will be. It may be to the wilds of Borneo or a weekend in Marthas Vineyard, biking and staying in a hostel. &nbsp;This is not MY group, it's OURS. Are you looking for someone, one person or more to accompany you on a standard-type cruise? A night at a concert? POST IT, become an event organizer, just contact me to do that.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>6. In some situations we will be able to save our members a lot of money on great trips compared to other commercial companies and meetup groups. EXAMPLE: Machu Pichu (Peru). Typically, a trip there with a guide up the \"Inca Trail\" is advertised at about $1700 plus air fare. From my research, a gude must be a Peru-based licensed guiding company. Therefore someone here can only subcontract it out to a local guiding company. From my research, the best Peru-based guiding company is \"Llama Path\". They have almost 500 Trip Advisor reviews with an average 5 stars. I called them. Cost if booked directly through them, for a group, about $600 each (as of 2015 prices). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Couples as well as singles will be welcome. &nbsp;Some people would like to do this type of adventurous traveling but need someone or others to go with them. This is the group for that . Become a co-organizer and post whatever kind of event or trip you like.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This will also be as a clearing house for ideas. If you have some great info to share, become a co-organizer and post whatever you like.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Those are my initial ideas, I'm looking for ideas from others, some of which are already coming in.&nbsp;THe concept will not doubt change develop over time. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.0500030518,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7165169,"name":"Barry"},"members":250,"name":"New England International Adventure Travel Meetup","id":18442355,"state":"MA","urlname":"New-England-Adventure-Travel-Meetup","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":42.1699981689,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Waltham","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1424266793000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"vegetarian","name":"Vegetarian","id":309},{"urlkey":"vegan","name":"Vegan","id":408},{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"animalrights","name":"Animal Rights","id":2349},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"fun-activities","name":"Fun Activities","id":17224},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"vegetarian-cooking","name":"Vegetarian cooking","id":21512},{"urlkey":"networking-for-vegetarians","name":"Networking for Vegetarians","id":36467},{"urlkey":"vegetarians-and-vegans-vegan-vegetarian-activism","name":"Vegetarians and Vegans & Vegan Vegetarian Activism","id":136597},{"urlkey":"meeting-new-people-making-friends","name":"Meeting New People\/Making Friends","id":916542}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Metro-Boston-Vegetarians\/","rating":4.75,"description":"<p>This group is for vegetarians interested in meeting other vegetarians in the area in a social environment.&nbsp;This is not an activism group, it's about enjoying fun activities with like-minded people.<\/p>\n<p>Nothing fun is off-limits!

It is an inherently painful process that can lead to loneliness, isolation, fear, anger, depression and a myriad of difficult thoughts, emotions and situations. While these terrifying places can feel traumatic, they also CAN BE THE VERY SEEDS TO TRANSFORMATION: a more hopeful future, a healthier lifestyle, a happier family dynamic, and a more abundant YOU! This Meet Up group is about WELCOMING those contemplating, enduring and recovering from divorce in the Greater Boston community into a fellowship of support and engagement about how to make the best of what feels like the worst. There really is no other way! Together, we will look at common themes\/questions in topic focused gatherings through a lens of empowerment, such as: How can I channel my anger or other feelings in a way that won't hurt myself and those I love? How can I invest in myself and my future instead of being afraid of it? How can I protect the best interests of my children? How can I find new friends and build positive relationships in the midst of so much loss? How can I take care of my needs for intimacy and connection while still learning to take care of myself alone? &nbsp;How can I learn from the mistakes I contributed to my past relationship instead of denying them, beating myself up with them, and\/or bringing them with me into a new one? How can I cultivate respect and cooperation for my former partner who was part of so much hurt? In what ways is my divorce the loving choice? What\/Who is my divorce allowing and inviting myself to become that I felt I could not in the context of marriage? ... Through sharing our ideas around these questions with good doses of open mindedness, compassion and humor, we can be incredibly empowering companions to one another on this arduous journey. I am a divorce mentor, spiritual director\/companionship, former hospital chaplain, personal trainer, and published author. I am also a mother of two teens, and hope to bring both my skills and experience as offerings to the table of transformation, and expect that you will do just the same - not as experts, but as fellow human beings on similar journeys.

Whether we like it or not, churches are pursuing our children. When my son\u2019s classmates talk about going to a church youth function and how much fun it was, he automatically wants to go and doesn\u2019t understand why we don\u2019t. Lets face it, churches do a lot of fun things with kids: lock-ins, parties, group games, ski trips, etc. When I was growing up, these things were the highlight of my youth. The church wants you to believe it\u2019s all the supernatural stuff that helps people, but the social benefits of belonging to a community is the real magic\u2014a magic we shouldn\u2019t let churches monopolize any longer.&nbsp;As a parent, I want my kids to have a safe place to explore their developing worlds view. A place where it\u2019s not just okay to ask questions, but encouraged.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/indiegogo-media-prod-cld\/image\/upload\/c_limit,w_620\/v1433866240\/efjc3dy1qep9syy8ctq1.jpg\"><\/p>\n<p><b>At Oasis, our Core Values are:<\/b><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n <p>People are more important than beliefs.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n <p>Reality is known through reason.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n <p>Meaning comes from making a difference.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n <p>Human hands solve human problems.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n <p>Be accepting and be accepted.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>For a long time, churches have had a virtual monopoly on the types of community that we see forming in groups like Oasis, Sunday Assembly, Humanist Hub, and others, each of which takes a slightly different approach so there is a group to fit the needs of any non-religious individual or family looking for&nbsp;that sense of community.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s time for Oasis \u2013 a well of compassion and reason where we can celebrate life&nbsp;and, together, make a difference.&nbsp;<b>A place where life is celebrated, family is&nbsp;valued, and all people matter.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Want an example of what an Oasis community looks like?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kansascity.com\/living\/star-magazine\/article5568999.html\">This article<\/a><span>&nbsp;in the Kansas City Star, profiling Kansas City Oasis, is a great example of what secular community can be, and what Boston Oasis will be aiming for.<\/span><\/p>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/indiegogo-media-prod-cld\/image\/upload\/c_limit,w_620\/v1433997127\/tjsrbnnw4b3gtqri3jrz.jpg\"><\/p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p><b>The Impact<\/b><\/p>\n<br>\n<blockquote>\n <p>Vibrant, tightly knit communities are central to human happiness and well-being; we are social creatures by nature.

The Oasis community model has produced thriving, successful, diverse communities in multiple cities across the nation and we are confident it will do so here as well. We have received, and will continue to receive, guidance from Oasis leaders who have built their own communities, as well as documented best-practices drawn from their experiences. From this foundation, Boston Oasis will develop into a unique iteration of this successful community model. Boston Oasis members will be free to suggest activities and events which are in keeping with the Oasis Core Values.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<br>\n<p><b>Where will Boston Oasis meet?<\/b><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n <p>While the Sunday gatherings will take place in a consistent location to be determined, there are certainly some ideas on what kind of spaces we will be looking for. We will be looking for locations which are accessible by car and by public transportation. We will be looking for locations with available parking. We will be looking for locations with good accessibility.Furthermore, it is important to note that Oasis events outside the Sunday gatherings will take place across the area where our community resides. Neighborhood Potlucks, Meetings of Minds (discussion groups), Game Nights, social events... all of these can and will be scheduled throughout the Boston area, typically with several venues for a single event on a given night.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help<\/b><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n <p>Want to volunteer?&nbsp; Visit our website and let us know you would like to help!<\/p>\n <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bostonoasis.org\/\">www.BostonOasis.org<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<br>\n<p><b>What is expected of members?<\/b><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n <p>Members are free to participate as much, or as little, as they want.

If you're that mom\/dad at the typical playdate standing in the corner, reading a book, etc. thinking \"Oh boy, what did I get myself into\", you belong here. Our babies\/toddler\/kids can play together while we either talk, (or don't!) We're not antisocial, but feel more comfortable on our own. Our kids may not be introverts themselves, so we generally agree that it's good for them to socialize and play with others if they want to. We can meet at Boston\/Metro-West area parks, libraries, kids\u2019 play areas, and attend free events, do arts and crafts, etc. If we feel like socializing with no pressure to be super-outgoing, we can have parents\u2019-night-outs too. So... if you want to join a parent's group, but dread the inevitable small talk, gossip, etc. If you want a fellow parent to talk to for some support, but don\u2019t feel like having to be ultra-social on a continuing basis, or if you ever feel judged or out of place a standard parents'\/playgroups\u2026 This group is for you.

We have two facilitators that guide the group's discussion.<\/p>\n<p><span>Our group is based on the Catholic Divorce Survival guide. There is a DVD series that goes into many topics around divorce, family, money, and survival.&nbsp; This group is very supportive to each other and offers a safe environment for sharing.

&nbsp; Some of the conditions caused or exacerbated by stress include Depression, Anxiety, Hypertension, Chronic Pain, Insomnia and PMS, just to name a few. &nbsp; Researches have showed that practicing techniques, such as meditation, regularly to elicit Relaxation Response (RR) will counteract the stress-induced health conditions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>\u201cThough most people in the world would choose to live in peace and joy if they could, reality rarely seems to allow it. Quite conversely, many of us experience life as a lost opportunity\u2014a suffering. Nonetheless, my own life has taught me that paradise is not as far away as we think\u2026 it can be uncovered within the heart and the mind, for it exists in each and every person at all times, with or without their knowledge.<\/span><i> --------- <b>by Master JinBodhi<\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Testimonials<\/b>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Forty Years of Insomnia <\/b>---&nbsp;<i>by Shang-li, Taichong<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<span>\"<\/span><span>For 40 years, I rarely had a good night\u2019s sleep.

I have over 125 written reviews for my work as a Medium and Reiki\/Spiritual Teacher that you can review on my website under Lauren dash Bortolam dot com. In this Meetup I will be offering a different approach of teaching areas that are not commonly taught to help develop your skills, protect you, and to prove you have the ability to heal and are never alone. All groups and classes have been designed by me and many areas taught that have not been covered before.","lon":-71.2200012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":185172332,"name":"Lauren Bortolami"},"members":152,"name":"Mansfield Angel, Psychic, Medium, & Spiritual Meetup","id":18495399,"state":"MA","urlname":"Mansfield-Angel-Psychic-Medium-Spiritual-Meetup","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":42.0200004578,"who":"Spiritually Aware Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Waltham","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1426189567000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"bornagain","name":"Born Again Christian","id":602},{"urlkey":"biblestudy","name":"Bible Study","id":2353},{"urlkey":"christianmin","name":"Christian Ministry","id":6623},{"urlkey":"jesus-christ","name":"Jesus Christ","id":20589}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Waltham-Biblical-Prayer-Group-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group open to anyone in the Waltham area, meeting in public places usually over food or drink, to honor Jesus Christ, to discuss the Christian Bible, to discuss sermons, to discuss other like-manner reading and study, to encourage one another to keep up with regular devotions, to serve as accountability to live in manner worthy of the Christian calling, to build one another up with encouragement from the Bible or from prayer, to pray for one another and the issues at our hearts, to talk about matters relating to Jesus and the Bible, and the related.<\/p>","lon":-71.2399978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":118710102,"name":"Rob Knight"},"members":17,"name":"Waltham Biblical Prayer Group Meetup","id":18496988,"state":"MA","urlname":"Waltham-Biblical-Prayer-Group-Meetup","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Prayer Warriors for Christ"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Hopkinton","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1426196523000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"plus-size-people","name":"Plus-Size People","id":15459},{"urlkey":"new-plus-size-friends","name":"New Plus Size Friends","id":38866},{"urlkey":"plus-size-women","name":"Plus Size Women","id":56311},{"urlkey":"plus-size-social-newtwork","name":"Plus Size Social Newtwork","id":61816},{"urlkey":"big-beautiful-people","name":"Big Beautiful People","id":97376},{"urlkey":"plus-size-fitness","name":"Plus Size Fitness","id":107276},{"urlkey":"plus-size-yoga","name":"Plus Size Yoga","id":814102}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hopkinton-Plus-Size-Yoga-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Please join us for this special workshop for plus size women being held on Sunday March 29th at Absolute Yoga.

Music is played for Standard and Smooth styles such as waltz, foxtrot, and tango as well as Latin and Rhythm styles including salsa, rumba, cha-cha, and the like. At Star Dance\u2019s Socials an optional 30 minute group dance lesson kicks off the evening as well!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>What on earth should I wear?!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Smart-casual to elegant attire is encouraged, but most importantly wear clothing you can move around in comfortably.

We will have general discussion over supper, followed by a lecture or book review by a member, followed by questions and discussion on the presentation. Anyone may volunteer a talk at a previous meeting or electronically (they should have attended at least once), as long as the group feels the topic is of general interest to members. Talks should be aimed at the non-specialized scientific listener, but may include some well-explained math, if the topic requires it (e.g., for physics or math topics). Speakers are encouraged to provide a copy of typed notes for each attendee at the meeting, especially if there are pictures, diagrams or math involved, and may also attach notes to the meeting announcement, which will be made available to members at least a week beforehand. Book reviews should not assume attendees have read the book, though they are invited to do so. Occasionally, a science-based science fiction book or film may be chosen for review. Book reviews may include selected readings aloud from the book by the presenter. Blackboards will not be available, and LCD displays will not be convenient (except for occasional photos), as attendees will sit at a long table.<\/p>\n<p>Until and unless we find another suitable meeting place to alternate with, future meetings will be in the Back Room of The Tavern in the Square, 921 Mass. Ave., Central Square, Cambridge, from 7-10 pm. The talk will begin about 8 pm.

Try to answer to 2 easy questions to avoid misunderstandings: - why women? is because you hate men? - No, although men are weirds (kidding ... some of my best friends are men). It seems I am weird because I don't find women in this particular field of developing bioinformatics tools (see this, for instance: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/chapmanb\/bcbio-nextgen#contributors\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/github.com\/chapmanb\/bcbio-nextgen#contributors<\/a>. Only a few out of 23 contributors. And this is one of the most collaborative tools I know) - and ... why? maybe women don't want this ... - well, I want to know if that is true, or whether there is another cultural reason behind that. I can not find any reason why women wouldn't be interested in developing bioinformatics tools. If there is, maybe I find what it is and I can publish a Nature paper (kidding again ...) Another experience was the last hackathons of codeFest (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.open-bio.org\/wiki\/Codefest_2014\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.open-bio.org\/wiki\/Codefest_2014<\/a>), where only there were two women out of 60 people... I just don't believe that there are no more like me... I am weird but not because of working on this. So, please, if you are interested in learn <b>how to develop<\/b> tools in Bioinformatics, <b>or you already do<\/b>, but feel alone (kidding again) ... just join the meetup and help to increase woman population in this field. The idea of this group is to be a proxy to the developer community (for now men dominated) with the hope to get a great balance in the field (and hope one day this group disappears).

In a Circlesong, a leader starts by improvising a line of music and gives it \/ teaches it to one part of the circle. The leader then develops a second part that goes with the first and gives that part to another section of the circle. Circlesingers learn and repeat the exact part given to them. Soon we are singing a four part (at least) chorus that has never been sung before. This chorus can support individual solos.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>The effect: never-before-sung, wordless, fun songs, melodies, harmonies, &amp;amp; rhythms. The music may be glorious or goofy, complex or simple.

Sing beautiful harmonies without sheet music. Witness a circle of people creating music together. Come sing with us!

In the long run, our goal is to create the first community art hotel where everything in the rooms from the food to the furniture to the dishes to the soap is made by members of the community. Patrons who come to stay can buy what they use in their rooms, buy something like it in the gallery, or take a class and learn how to make it. The community art hotel will serve as the center of our creative community while also acting as an incubator to support artists as small businesses. We believe that everyone, whatever their background, makes something and our events encourage participants to connect with and celebrate what they make. &nbsp;Learn more at: <a href=\"https:\/\/mirandashearth.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/mirandashearth.com<\/a><\/p>","lon":-71.0299987793,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":77131252,"name":"Miranda"},"members":116,"name":"Miranda's Hearth","id":18553268,"state":"MA","urlname":"Mirandas-Hearth","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Community Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Randolph","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1429453697000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Randolph-Spiritual-Growth-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This is a group for those who may classify themselves as \"spiritual but not religious.\"  I've been reading a lot of books, A Course in Miracles (I'm still working through it), Conversations with God by Neale Donald Walsch, The Power of Now by Eckhardt Tolle, A Return to Love by Marianne Williamson, The Seat of the Soul by Gary Zukav, The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz, and others.

This group aims to recognize beatboxing (aka vocal percussion) as an art form and musical style. At BBS, we'll be hosting beatboxing technique workshops (learn a new sound to add to your repertoire!), beatbox jam sessions, beatbox open mics and performances, beatbox competitions, and technology workshops (loopers, recording techniques, etc.). Events will take place at various places around Boston with superb echo and reverb! (Think Kenmore station staircase, under bridges, etc.). Brendon Albertson (Green Beatbox) created this group out of a passion to give beatboxing the respect it deserves, just as any other style of music or instrument. A large network of beatboxers exists online, but to this day European countries are far ahead of the U.S. in creating an in-person beatboxing scene.

Whether you're new to the group or have been playing with us for years, we're excited to have you! We're looking for people who play for the love of the game and the community, and we welcome everyone regardless of skill level (these are just kindergarten sports, after all). Not only is meetup kickball cheaper than a league and a little bit less of a long-term commitment (though we won't be surprised if you become a weekly kickballer), this is a much better way to meet other people than joining an official league. In leagues you really only interact with your teammates, but in meetup kickball you switch teams every week, meeting all kinds of new folks! Our games are often played with beer in hand (leading to some impressive plays), and we tend to hit up local pubs for post-game celebrations. Anyone and everyone can join - the only thing that we ask is that if your plans change last minute, that you not just bail. The successful meetup communities that we've been a part of are very serious about following through on commitments - if you say you're going to come, don't pull out last minute unless absolutely necessary, and if you absolutely can't make it - let the organizer know! No-shows aren't gonna fly here. WE'RE GOING TO BE PLAYING ON WEDNESDAYS! We'll alternate between Brookline\/Cambridge (stay tuned for event deets). Dorise will be leading Brookline games, Mitch &amp; Lisa will be leading Cambridge games. Also, there will be a one-time fee of $5, just to help us pay for equipment and the cost of the meetup group. Can't wait to meet you and kick some balls! ~Dorise, Mitch, &amp; Lisa<br><\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/3\/d\/highres_437147677.jpeg","photo_id":437147677,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/3\/d\/600_437147677.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/3\/d\/thumb_437147677.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":8988783,"name":"Dorise"},"members":132,"name":"BostonKickball2015","id":18577817,"state":"MA","urlname":"BostonKickball2015","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Ballers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Sharon","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430855832000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"backgammon","name":"Backgammon","id":601},{"urlkey":"games","name":"Games","id":15992},{"urlkey":"board-games","name":"Board Games","id":19585},{"urlkey":"game-night","name":"Game Night","id":40126},{"urlkey":"backgammon-coed-competition","name":"Backgammon Coed Competition","id":40469},{"urlkey":"social-backgammon","name":"Social Backgammon","id":42712},{"urlkey":"backgammon-on-a-weekly-basis","name":"Backgammon on a Weekly Basis","id":116504},{"urlkey":"casual-backgammon","name":"Casual Backgammon","id":1415442}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/South-Shore-Backgammon-Meetup\/","rating":4,"description":"Tired of playing backgammon against your iPad?

Each class is designed to bring you into the most powerful, loving and inspired connection to yourself.

A labyrinth offers only one path into the center, and the same path back out. Although there are turns to negotiate, there are no blind alleys, dead ends, or tricks - as in a maze. In fact, quite the opposite - the ancient design of a labyrinth was created for the powerful purpose of allowing you to completely trust the path you are on, to let your mind simply rest, that your spirit might find its way to your inner center along the path.<\/p>\n<p>The creation of labyrinths in all kinds of media (stones, earth, portable painted canvases), has had a great resurgence in recent years. There are many labyrinths in this area. <b>I would love for this group site to become a channel for folks to plan walks, connect and explore labyrinths all around.<\/b>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I also encourage this space to be a community center of information for sharing and learning about labyrinths and the practice of labyrinth walking together.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If this is of interest to you, please join us. I look forward to walking with you!<\/p>\n<p>To begin, I want to invite you to a regular monthly Full Moon Labyrinth Walk that I host at the Somerville Growing Center (just outside of Union Square in Somerville). I offer this outdoor labyrinth walk gathering each month on the Sunday nearest the full moon - May through October. Please look for more details listed on our meetup site. Welcome, and feel free to message if you have questions and\/or ideas!<\/p>\n<p>[a quote from <i>The Way of the Labyrinth<\/i> by Helen Curry: <i>\u201cPeople come to labyrinths for a multitude of reasons, but most find that walking a labyrinth can be a transformative experience. As people tread through the turns and counterturns, the world begins to drop away. Walking, breathing, being - things that we never think about in the day-to-day whirl of life - become conscious and deliberate. The spiritual and physical merge into a walking meditation. Our pace becomes a background rhythm against which we are able to clear our minds.\u201d<\/i>]<\/p>","lon":-71.1200027466,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/4\/e\/1\/highres_437818593.jpeg","photo_id":437818593,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/4\/e\/1\/600_437818593.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/4\/e\/1\/thumb_437818593.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8514806,"name":"Katrina "},"members":136,"name":"Labyrinth Walking","id":18621831,"state":"MA","urlname":"Labyrinth-Walking","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":42.4000015259,"who":"Labyrinth Walkers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1432559004000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"gay-singles","name":"Gay Singles","id":15196},{"urlkey":"lesbian-friends","name":"Lesbian Friends","id":21736},{"urlkey":"lesbian-social-networking","name":"Lesbian Social Networking","id":36427},{"urlkey":"single-lesbians","name":"Single Lesbians","id":53594},{"urlkey":"gay-and-lesbian-singles","name":"Gay and Lesbian Singles","id":116820}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Single-Only-Gay-Women-Events\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Hi!

They take hold like parasites in our brains, and make us do things\u2014even while we are doing them\u2014that we don\u2019t want to be doing, that make us feel out of control, and which injure us. Sound familiar? <br><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Meetup is for people who know what I am talking about. Who may have gained weight as a result of having these cravings. Who may have lost opportunities in their lives\u2014romantic, social, business\u2014because of weight gain and being overweight. These cravings\u2014and all the problems associated with them\u2014can be eliminated. Ask me. I went through what I\u2019m describing many years ago, gaining weight, eating a pound of chocolate a day, and feeling gross and disgusting. I was overweight as a kid, and\u2014long story short\u2014developed an alcohol problem as a young adult. Managed to sober up at age 33, but my addiction switched to food, and eventually\u2014another long story made short\u2014discovered a solution. A solution that I\u2019ve improved on, and use to this day. <br><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I decided to share it with the world. You don\u2019t have to live with the pain of being overweight. Of dealing with \u201cweight creep\u201d, as it inches upward. Of the stress of feeling your clothing getting tighter and tighter. Of constantly berating, belittling and beating yourself up for being unable to deal with this. Of knowing things won\u2019t get better the way you are going now. There is a solution for you. That\u2019s what this Meetup is for. To give you the first steps toward regaining control over your eating, and your life. To help you not only lose weight, but more importantly, keep it off. <br><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And not only will the Meetup be free, but for attending you will get a report entitled \u201cWhat the Diet Experts and Gurus Don\u2019t Know\u201d. Plus you will get actionable steps as to what to do next. <br><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a whole foods, plant based approach--but don't worry!&nbsp; There is no political agenda, this is only an approach to health and weight loss and management.&nbsp; No one is going to insist you stop eating meat, unless you choose.&nbsp; There are SO many benefits of doing so, that you may decide for yourself that it is a direction you want to go.&nbsp; Even if you don't know how to cook, give it a try--do you have anything to lose, except some weight?<br><\/p>","lon":-71.1800003052,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/9\/0\/5\/highres_439158693.jpeg","photo_id":439158693,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/9\/0\/5\/600_439158693.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/9\/0\/5\/thumb_439158693.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":2209370,"name":"Al D."},"members":77,"name":"Curb Those Cravings!

Using Meetup as a platform we sponsor events that promote the forming of a strong and well informed community of sex-positive people who support each other in their endeavors to lead richer, fuller, sexier, lives. Our mission is to improve the world by embracing the tenets of the Sex-Positive Movement. Most of our events fall into either the social, or workshop categories; others include festivals, fundraisers and field trips.

The focus is on problems with a technical component. They can be in any field and need not emphasize pure mathematics. However, the research must involve reproducible mathematical calculations or computational procedures. The research should be original -- whether or not it turns out to be novel.<\/p>\n<p>Many of us have interesting research ideas outside our formal area of expertise that we'd like to explore or actually are exploring.&nbsp; Academic research has grown highly compartmentalized.&nbsp; Determining an appropriate publication venue, tracking down relevant prior work, and casting language into field-specific terminology can easily become a full time job.&nbsp; Even determining whether the work has been done before can be quite a challenging task.&nbsp; We're often faced with a choice:&nbsp; spend our free time solving interesting problems or spend it dealing with these tasks. &nbsp; <br> <br>The goal of this group is both to provide a forum for sharing such ideas and to aid members in exploring possible venues for publication where applicable. &nbsp; <br> <br>Here is a quick test to see if you would enjoy this group: <br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp; Do you tend to come up with interesting ideas, possibly in widely varying fields, with a mathish bent?&nbsp; If the answer is no, then your meetup search criteria may need some work. <br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;2.&nbsp; Do you actually have the time and inclination to solve those problems?&nbsp; If the answer is no, then what you're looking for is a grad student. <br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;3.&nbsp; Would you say you do enough quick checking to avoid spending \"a month in the lab\" to \"save an hour in the library\", as the old adage goes?&nbsp; If not, then you may wish to try a magical incantation that goes \"google\". <br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;4.&nbsp; Are you ok with (unknowingly) doing something that already has been done?&nbsp; If the answer is no, then you need to spend the next 16 years of your life in academia developing cutting edge expertise in one field. <br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;5.&nbsp; Would you say you have some sort of academic background in a technical discipline (physics, math, engineering, CS, etc), are familiar with the nature of scientific research, and follow such methods in your own research?&nbsp; I.e., is your approach methodical, reproducible, and technical?&nbsp; If not, then your ideas are brilliant and the establishment is persecuting you and you are way way way too smart for this group.&nbsp; We'd never understand your perpetual motion idea and are too closed minded to hear you endlessly explain your latest conspiracy theory.&nbsp; You're looking for the group next door. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;6.&nbsp; Are you open to feedback, including criticism, and including being proven completely wrong?&nbsp; While feedback in our group will be constructive, are you ready to hear -- \"Hey, isn't that just the Jablowski equation?\" or \"Um, that missing minus sign invalidates your entire argument.\"?&nbsp; If not, the you're probably looking for a mutual affirmation group.&nbsp; If you need someone to simply tell you you're a genius, I can recommend this great guy on the corner in Harvard Square.&nbsp; For just $10 he'll tell you that you're the smartest person on the planet and justify it by misquoting various famous people.&nbsp; He services most of the Harvard faculty, from what I hear. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;7.&nbsp; Are you open to writing up and presenting your idea?&nbsp; If not, then you probably are onto something really really really big.&nbsp; You should hide the encrypted hard drive in a safe that you sink in the ocean.&nbsp; Don't forget to have (old) Spock cut out a piece of your brain and seal it in an alternate universe to protect you from yourself as well.&nbsp; Otherwise, the government will steal and misuse it, other scientists will plagiarize it, and\/or Apple will patent it and sue you.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>The problems our members tackle need not be profound or earth shattering.&nbsp; The subjects can vary all over the place.&nbsp; If you want a flavor of what I've played with recently, you can look at my idea blog \"www.aplaceofsand.com\" (it has a mix of other stuff too -- but the \"Fairness in sentencing\", \"Inflation\", and \"Voting\" articles are representative). &nbsp; <br> <br>For obvious reasons, I'm going to be selective in admission to this group.&nbsp; This isn't (just) because I'm pretentious.&nbsp; I want to ensure that members will share reasonable ideas and offer reasonable feedback.&nbsp; If you read through this huge blurb, you've passed motivation test #1. &nbsp; <br> <br>Motivation test #2 involves sending me some work you did.&nbsp; It can be an academic publication if you have one, or an unpublished piece.&nbsp; For this purpose, it need not be a creative work (a pedagogical one will suffice).&nbsp; However, it should have a technical aspect to it.&nbsp; Also, please provide a brief description of your background and interests. &nbsp; <br> <br>I also reserve the right (and will exercise it) to revoke membership for anyone who meaningfully misrepresents themselves or their work.&nbsp; Really, don't bother.&nbsp; It will be blatantly obvious after 5 minutes of casual conversation.&nbsp; You'll be unhappy and I'll be unhappy, and this group is about fun and happiness. <br> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.0999984741,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/9\/b\/highres_438919611.jpeg","photo_id":438919611,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/9\/b\/600_438919611.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/9\/b\/thumb_438919611.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":14139255,"name":"Ken H"},"members":6,"name":"Boston Area Research Projects Group","id":18688633,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Area-Research-Projects-Group","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Researchers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1434940422000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"beatles","name":"The Beatles","id":153},{"urlkey":"70smusic","name":"70's Music","id":3188},{"urlkey":"60smusic","name":"60's Music","id":3784},{"urlkey":"music","name":"Music","id":15018},{"urlkey":"rock-music","name":"Rock Music","id":21048},{"urlkey":"favorite-beatles-cover-bands-in-the-area","name":"Favorite Beatles Cover Bands in the Area","id":43270},{"urlkey":"john-lennon","name":"John Lennon","id":69633},{"urlkey":"george-harrison","name":"George Harrison","id":69634},{"urlkey":"ringo-starr","name":"Ringo Starr","id":69635},{"urlkey":"listening-to-music","name":"Listening To Music","id":109969},{"urlkey":"beatles-trivia","name":"Beatles Trivia","id":127284},{"urlkey":"beatle-songs","name":"Beatle Songs","id":127285},{"urlkey":"paul-mccartney","name":"Paul McCartney","id":787712},{"urlkey":"beatles-activity-suggestions","name":"Beatles Activity Suggestions","id":820452},{"urlkey":"beatle-people","name":"Beatle People","id":1089842}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Beatles-Society\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Do you love the Beatles?

Militarism discourages serious reflection on the moral gravity of war.&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p>A militaristic culture derives its power from a few basic assumptions:<\/p>\n<p>The military is a force for good;<span> <br><\/span><span>The military is only used in defense;<\/span><span>&nbsp;<span> <br><\/span><\/span><span>Therefore military service is an honorable profession;<span> <br><\/span><\/span><span>Therefore supporting the troops is a patriotic duty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We believe these are faulty assumptions.<\/p>\n<p>When we thank veterans for keeping us free and safe, we reassure them that particular, current wars are good, and necessary to keep us free and safe. When we congratulate teenagers for joining the military, we discourage them from considering the spiritual and psychological consequences of violence, enmity, destruction and the taking of human life. When we champion the United States as \u201cthe greatest country on Earth,\u201d we overlook the dark side of American history: American exceptionalism provides the rich soil in which militarism takes root.<\/p>\n<p>Militarism creates a convenient blind spot for the terrible costs of war. At its most bold, it dares and encourages young people to sacrifice their lives, and possibly their souls, at the unholy altar of the State.<\/p>\n<p><b>2. Militarism is a spiritual disease akin to the worshiping of idols.&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Ten Commandments reads Thou Shall Not Kill; Jesus Christ was the Prince of Peace; and Catholic tradition condemns war in the strongest terms. Manifest Destiny, American Exceptionalism, and Christian Nationalism have no basis in the Catholic understanding of the world. As explained by Cardinal Walter Kasper, an overly strong identification of the Gospel with a particular culture or nation is an \u201cecclesiological heresy.\u201d Killing does not become okay simply because the killer was wearing the stars and stripes. The Bible makes it very clear that God judges people according to His laws, not Man\u2019s laws.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cObey God rather than men.\u201d Acts 5:29 <br>\u201cNo one man can serve two masters.\u201d Matthew 6:24 <br>\u201cThou Shalt Have No God Before Me.\u201d Exodus 20:3<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/catholicsagainstmilitarism.com\/manifesto\/\">Please click this link to read the whole statement.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>We encourage all Boston-area Catholics who agree with our goals to join even if they are not currently practicing the Faith.

Most of us work alone, from an internal road map, and might not have a place to share our experiences with others who've \"been there\". The purpose of the group is to support and encourage each other in making our best work. To do that we need to foster a strong daily artistic practice. Discussion topics for the group will include strategies for dealing with our inner critic and overcoming roadblocks, opportunities for sharing our work with others and issues that can arise as a result, techniques for time management and habit creation, sources of inspiration, and more. We'll also share our resources for eye-opening books we've read or classes we've taken; ideas about how we've set up our work environment to get and stay in the zone; and favorite materials, tools and supply houses. Come and meet others who have something pretty fundamental in common with you...and maybe make some new artist friends! My intention is that this become a small, committed group of 5-7 artists. I'm looking for people who - if the group is a fit - are willing and able to attend regular monthly meetings, to be held on weekday afternoons. Therefore, as soon as we have a solid group, membership will close and only re-open if a member leaves the group. The idea is that this will enable us to benefit from really getting to know and trust one other and to foster a sense of accountability and community.","lon":-71.0500030518,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":39377652,"name":"Ayli"},"members":50,"name":"The Boston Working Artists Meetup","id":18704570,"state":"MA","urlname":"The-Boston-Working-Artists-Meetup","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Working Artists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Marlborough","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1435543839000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"scrapbook","name":"Scrapbooking","id":211},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"single-moms","name":"Single Moms","id":16264},{"urlkey":"handmade-crafts","name":"Handmade Crafts","id":16459},{"urlkey":"paper-crafts","name":"Paper Crafts","id":17320},{"urlkey":"single-parent-support-group","name":"Single Parent Support","id":18668},{"urlkey":"divorced-parents","name":"Divorced Parents","id":24314},{"urlkey":"preschoolers","name":"Preschoolers","id":30878},{"urlkey":"support-for-single-moms","name":"Support for Single Moms","id":31445},{"urlkey":"professional-single-mothers","name":"Professional Single Mothers","id":36111},{"urlkey":"divorced-moms","name":"Divorced moms","id":40563},{"urlkey":"parents-without-partners","name":"Parents Without Partners","id":44880},{"urlkey":"raising-a-child-as-a-single-mother","name":"Raising a Child as a Single Mother","id":100726},{"urlkey":"active-parents","name":"Active Parents","id":148331}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SingleM-O-M\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group is for anyone who is a single mother who is looking to meet other single moms.

The year-long exhibit will examine the life history of the motorcycle, from the pioneering 1800\u2019s era - when an engine was simply bolted to a bicycle  \u2013 through the present day technological and artistic triumphs achieved by manufacturers in Asia, Europe and the United States, leading to a shift in cultural perceptions, and a world-wide fan base of enthusiasts.  The exhibit features some of the rarest, most technically innovative, historically significant, and beautiful motorcycles of all time, brought together within the context of the history of the automobile, examining technological and style parallels and the evolution of the motorcycle from an inexpensive alternative to the motorcar to a distinct entity and potent social and cultural symbol.  Abounding with visually compelling examples of the impact of the motorcycle on popular culture, the exhibit will recall for the visitor such classics as \u201cEasy Rider\u201d, \u201cThe Wild One\u201d, \u201cThe World\u2019s Fastest Indian\u201d, and other iconic cinematic portrayals of the motorcycle as the ultimate expression of freedom. Iconic brands such as BMW, Ducati, Harley Davidson, Honda and Indian will be among the featured marques. The competitive speed arena will be well represented at \u201cBeauty of the Beast\u201d with the 1970 Harley Davidson Sportster Powered Streamliner from the Bonneville Motorcycle family, and both the Pro Mod Suzuki TL 1000 and Suzuki Hyabusa motorcycles used by NHRA Pro Stock Motorcycle racer Sam Herwitz, a Newton, MA resident and drag racing legend, all part of the racing and competitive riding section of the exhibit. The very newest, most exotic motorcycles the world factories have to offer, including the Ducati 119\nSuperleggera \u201csuperbike\u201d will be on display as will a complete representation of the century\u2019s best in motorcycling.  Legends like the Vincent Black Shadow from England, a rare MV Augusta, and a historically significant 1935 Morgan Super Sport Three-Wheeler will highlight the evolutionary variations of the motorcycle.  European greats including the 1923 BMW r32, which was part of the Art of the Motorcycle at Guggenheim, acclaimed for rocketing BMW\u2019s motorcycle success with its masterful design concept that would endure the rest of the century, and the 1935 BMW r17, representing the height of the Art Deco movement, will punctuate the mechanical, artistic, design and styling aspects of the Motorcycle.   \u201cLeather and Lace \u2013 Women and Motorcycles\u201d, will explore the relationship of women to motorcycles and focus on some outstanding individuals who made history on the seat of their own machine and in the motorcycle world, whether breaking barriers, making their own mark or through outstanding feats of their own.  The \u201cBeauty of the Beast\u201d exhibit runs through the year, concurrently with the popular summer \u201cLawn Events\u201d auto shows schedule.  Admission is: $10 for adults, $5 children, seniors, and active military.

Who were the Druids?? And more importantly who are they today? What does this tradition have to offer you and the world? Join the group to find out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Members will gather for monthly \"hearthsides\" which are pot-luck social gatherings and discussions on a diverse range of topics related to the ancient to the modern understanding of Druidry including its history and folklore, philosophy, theology, environmental and social applications, and how this earth-based spiritual tradition can inform today's global issues. Like many modern pagan traditions, Druidry exists in the sphere of a personal\/experiential path, without dogma, that each of us must learn to walk and interpret for ourselves. Seen today more as a \"spiritually informed philosophy of life\" than a religion in the traditional sense, this path is completely compatible with many lifestyles regardless of your own cultural and\/or religions background. <br><\/p>\n<p>Members will also be invited to participate in the eight sacred seasonal holy days of the Druid calendar, which will be held outdoors in natural settings. <br><\/p>\n<p>Who should join this group? Anyone interested in learning more about this unique spiritual tradition.<\/p>\n<p>Do you need to be of Celtic ancestry to join? Certainly not. All that is required is an open mind.<\/p>\n<p>Do you need to be a pagan to join? Certainly not. Modern Druidry (often referred to as neo-druidry) is a sophisticated spiritually-informed philosophy and way-of-life more than a traditional \"religion\" per say and it's ideas can be applied in many dimensions of life regardless of your background. Arising from ancient indo-european sources, yet informed by in modern ideas and constantly evolving, Druidry today transcends eastern and western worldviews as it transcends the spiritual and scientific divides to offer a way of \"being in the world\" that is firmly grounded by its connection to nature and the environment, yet committed to helping humanity grow towards a more enlightened society. <br><\/p>\n<p>This is a closed group and only members can see internal content including the locations of events.<br><\/p>\n<p>Members will be approved based on their expressed desire to particulate actively in social\/educational events as well as the more experiential celebrations. Members ought to have the minimum physical constitution and interest to participate in events held outdoors in natural locations under diverse weather conditions. The eight sacred days of the Druid calendar will be celebrated shine barring extreme situations, and if you are only an \"indoor celebrant\" or have an aversion to getting your shoes and trousers a bit muddy then this group might not be for you. Locations will be accessible to the Boston area as much as possible. <br><\/p>\n<p>This group is the initial step towards establishing a local \"seed group\" within the Order of Bards Ovates &amp; Druids (OBOD).
