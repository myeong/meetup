We are the ONLY business alliance in the Newark area focused on SMALL businesses. Promoting, connecting, advising, advocating on YOUR behalf for greater visibility... OUR FOCUS is LOCALISM and driving $$$ and sustainability to your business. We have a signature event called the ReMIXX every month where we feature an entrepreneur. NOW we'd like to meet to determine how we can better address the opportunities and challenges of the local change maker in a more intimate setting Our Goals 1. Create a strong member network for local innovators, equip them with the resources they need to prosper, create jobs, and function in harmony with local ecosystems. 2. Keep Dollars in the Local Economy\/Reduce Capital Leakage \u2013 for every $100 spent at a locally-owned business, $73 remains in the local economy, compared to that of a non-locally owned business which only retains $43. We know that entrepreneurship fuels economic innovation and prosperity, and serves as a key means for families to move out of low wage jobs and into the middle class. 3. Increase small business visibility and foster Economic Inclusion; locally owned businesses build strong communities. By sustaining vibrant communities, linking neighbors via economic and social relationships, leading to strong healthy engaged communities.
