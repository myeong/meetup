These experiences develop our members into greater communicators while practicing essential leadership skills. </p> <p>Toastmasters is a safe place to fail, to practice, to learn, and to grow into the best leader and communicator you can be. Come visit and find out what we can do for you! </p> <p>\n\n\nCurrent Toastmasters:</p> <p>Please help us make this club a success and introduce this community to the incredible benefits Toastmasters has to offer. We need help spreading the word and ensuring that meetings run smoothly. If you are interested in volunteering to speak, fulfill a meeting role, or helping to promote the club; please let me know ASAP. If you are interested in sponsoring or mentoring this club (and earning credit toward your Advanced Leader Silver award in the process) please contact me directly. </p> <p><br/>Thank you in advance for helping to bring the benefits of Toastmasters to the diverse and underserved communities of the Northside. Your involvement makes a difference!</p> <p>\n\nPlease note: The club will continue to meet at this location on the 2nd &amp; 4th Thursday of each month from 6:30-7:30pm.

We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.</p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p> <p>6.

This FIGARO doesn't miss a beat—musically or emotionally.

The Count has his eye on his valet's fiancée, who happens to be his wife's chambermaid. The Countess is pursued by the charming Cherubino—a boy disguised as a girl! Upstairs meets downstairs in this glorious romp.</p> <p>With Chad Armstrong and SummerFest Europe's International Voice Competition winner Katarzyna Wilk, Mozart and DaPonte's opera buffa is helmed by Director Jonathan Eaton, Associate Director Sarah Young, and Conductor Walter Morales.</p> <p>More on this production:<br/><a href=\"http://otsummerfest.org/events/marriage-of-figaro\" class=\"linkified\">http://otsummerfest.org/events/marriage-of-figaro</a></p> <p><b>Other performances:</b> Sunday, July 19 at 2:00 pm; Saturday, August 1 at 7:30 pm.<br/>Free pre-curtain talk before July 19 &amp; August 1 performances.

This is a fantastic opportunity to see work by one of the most influential photographers of our day. The exhibit includes 30 never before seen images, video footage, contact sheets and video interviews. I am scheduling this as an all day Meetup. We will attend the exhibit and see the Museum and then spend the day photographing the architecture and sights of Cleveland. ( it is Cleveland so that shouldn't take more than 10 min. ) Sorry, couldn't help myself. We can meet for lunch as a group and talk about our images, then go and shoot some more and meet up again later. Or we can figure out something when we get there. I think it would be wise to carpool in order to prevent people getting lost or separated. We can meet in Cranberry Twp. and go from there. The parking lot in front of Michael's in Cranberry is large and well lit.</p>",

There is a small fee per person ($5) to attend Games Day, to cover the cost of the rental hall. This fee is waived for all first-time attendees. The fee will be collected when you arrive, and will grant access to all the games contributed by our members, for use that day. We will be holding off taking any new yearly payments, but those that did pay will be honored.</p> <p>Speaking of games, there are always a multitude of board, card, role-playing, and miniature games being played on any given Game Day, but a few events are near constants.</p> <p>• Our Multi-Player Magic League runs each Game Day, starting around 11am. It’s a league that runs Jan-Oct. There is a second league starting at 4:30PM with modified rules and decks, please read the forum post for more information.</p> <p>• Several RPG campaigns are also run each Game Day, including our \"One-Shot Saturdays\", stand-alone adventures run by various GMs each month.</p> <p>• There are several miniature games that regularly appear at each Game Day. These vary each month, but some examples are X-Wing, Lord of the Rings, Firestorm Armada, Dystopian Wars, Axis and Allies: War at Sea &amp; Angels 20, BattleTech, AT-43, Infinity, and others.</p> <p>• Don’t forget our extensive board game contingent. You can always find players for a board game, whether you bring your own or try out one of the many titles our BGers own and bring each month to our Games Library.</p> <p>We ask that everyone attending our Game Days brings something along as a snack and/or drink, for the community to share in. The facility has a full kitchen, so items that need refrigerated are OK. Most people bring some soda, chips, cookies, veggie tray, etc. This helps everyone have a good time without worrying about snacks or drinks.</p> <p>See you at Games Day!</p> <p><br/>Location Information:: <br/>Springdale United Presbyterian Church <br/>859 Pittsburgh Street <br/>Springdale, PA 15144</p>",

This will be the second library meetup at the Brookline library. We would like to host informal library talks from time to time. The Brookline library is conveniently located and has reserved spots for us in the smaller study room. This room accommodates up to 20 people.</p> <p>Parking is at metered diagonal spots along the side of the street the library is on, or parallel parking is available on the opposite side of the street. Parking is rarely a challenge on Brookline Blvd. but is metered on Saturdays, so it may cost a few dollars to park for the two hour meetup. Free parking may be available on side streets if you don't mind a bit of walking.</p> <p>Topics will be anything anyone would like to discuss--anything good that you experienced this week, steps you made to challenge your anxieties, ideas for future meetups, or anything else related to the group's subject. Our goal is to keep the library events for this Meetup group small and will be capping the event. Feel free to message me with any topics you would like to see discussed at these types of meetups and we will make sure you have a chance to have your voice heard.</p> <p>Hope to see you there!</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/8/8/6/600_437267238.jpeg\" /></p>",

Unfortunately Sienna Sulla Piazza is completely booked for that night. I suggest meeting at Chipotle in the same area (Market Square - 211 Forbes AvePittsburgh, PA 15222) instead. This will allow people to arrive late and eat when they wish. </p> <p>Tours start at 7:00 pm in town and we should  be there at 6:45 pm. Tickets are non-refundable (rain or shine) and are $15. All tickets are bought on-line. I bought my ticket.

Here are the details about this event: </i><br/><b>Fellow Ambassadors to the Universe, and Ambassadors to be. Trained and untrained are welcome!</b></p> <p>Join with a group of people who want to raise our level of awareness, and continue to make contact with Extra-Terrestrial and Spiritual beings of other realms. </p> <p>Dress for outdoors, and <b>BRING A LAWN CHAIR</b> to sit upon. </p> <p><b>Seekers of the Truth:</b> </p> <p><b>John Bernhard</b> will lead this training effort; Both John (and Larry) have been on week-long trips with Dr. Steven Greer. <a href=\"http://www.cseti.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.cseti.org</a>   Greer has devoted his life to: revelation of the Truth about ET's; how we can make contact with them directly; and, raising the Consciousness level of the planet. During this session we will:<br/><b> 1. </b>Talk about the intention of the Contact<br/><b>2.</b> Educate you about the various contact methods/devices<br/><b>3. </b>Perform the protocol using a guided meditation and a quiet meditation. (For the actual contact we will generally be in darkness beneath the night sky, just after sunset)<br/><b>4.</b> Talk about equipment/gear/tools needed for our nighttime contacts </p> <p>If you own a smart phone, down load \"ET Contact Tool\" for Apple or Android and listen to the meditations (this is what we're about). </p> <p>In the meantime, and in preparation for this training, meditate on your own, and prepare yourself for the Loving Presence of our Brethren from afar. You might even make the intention at bedtime to have information delivered to you in your dreams (we did this extensively in AZ). Raise your aspiration level! (In all aspects of life). </p> <p>A major concern and purpose of training is that each and every one of you participating in a night time meeting must be comfortable with making contact. If a fear-ridden person is in the group, the ET's will know/sense it, and will not make contact with us as it will frighten that person. </p> <p>After training, if you cannot yet be comfortable with the concept of actual Contact, please withdraw yourself from the outdoor portion of this group in deference to the others. Continue to meditate and make contact in your own terms until you are ready. </p> <p>We have nearly always made Contact during each night time session in the form of messages, lights in the sky and even lights (light Beings) amongst our group.<br/>We hope you will be able to join us, expand our meditative strength and group awareness.</p> <p>If you know other people who wish to make their contact with the ET's, <b>you may invite them for this training session.</b> <b>(You may not invite a new person to a night time Contact Session on your own: initial training is required). </b></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b><i>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION please contact Larry <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]</a></i></b></p> <p><b><i>If you email him personally that you are coming, he will be able to inform you about a cancellation.</i></b></p> <p><i>In Peace and Love for All That Is, Larry and John <br/></i></p> <p>We use the CE-5 Protocol in our contacts. <a href=\"http://www.cseti.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.cseti.org</a><br/><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>DIRECTIONS TO THE TRAINING:</b> </p> <p>• <b>On Blackburn Rd,1/8 mile uphill from the YMCA complex.</b></p> <p>• <b> Look for stone walls on the LEFT as you go up the hill. </b></p> <p><b>• We are Usually in the rear of the park in an isolated location.

Everyone is trying to sell their vision of SOA as \"microservices\". You know it has reached the mainstream, because the backlash has started, too.</p> <p>When you boil it down, Microservices trade business domain complexity for infrastructure complexity. If you have a lot of business domains, this can help keep your software from turning into a big ball of mud. If you don't, it's just building complexity for complexity's sake.</p> <p>In this talk, we will look at why and when you would want to build microservices, how you would do so, and what to avoid. We won't fixate on the size of services, but on how to split things apart. After this talk, you should know if you should consider using microservices.</p> <p>-- Meeting Sponsor--</p> <p>This meeting is sponsored by <a href=\"http://www.s2scout.com/\">S2scout</a>.</p> <p>S2scout is comprised of seasoned recruiters, a.k.a. “Scouts”, who are dedicated to helping clients AND candidates find the right talent or opportunity without wasting anyone's time.  </p> <p>Our dedication to providing clients AND candidates with fresh talent or unique opportunities is in the “S2scout” name. “S2” is the military term for intelligence. “Scout”, by definition, is a person sent out ahead of a main force to gather information about the target's position, strength and movements.</p> <p>Our recruiters don’t sit and wait for candidates to come to them, our Scouts are in front of the search utilizing tactics that are…well…CLASSIFIED.</p> <p>S2scout is a Pittsburgh based Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) providing specialized staffing services to small, medium and large organizations across several industries.</p>",

Folks begin arriving around 5PM, and play begins table by table as soon as we have three or four players plus a set.  (We usually have 3-5 tables.)  By 6:15 or so, most players have arrived. We rotate among the tables... at the end of each game, East walks around to see if another table is close to the end of their game, so that two players can swap places.   At the other end of the evening... play must end by 9PM when Panera closes.  Tables begin wrapping up play any time after 8:15 or so.</p> <p><br/>If you have never played, or if you have not played for a very long time, we highly recommend that you take a Mah Jong 101 beginner class before playing with us - beginner classes are offered every few months.  Mah jong is a wonderful game, but it's hard to learn by just watching others play!</p> <p><br/>Please order your 2015 card from the National Mah Jongg League, here: <a href=\"http://www.nationalmahjonggleague.org/\"><a href=\"http://www.nationalmahjonggleague.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.nationalmahjonggleague.org/</a></a> Amazon.com also carries the cards. Note that you want the NMJL card, and no other!

This is for players who have had a few lessons or know some basic chords and want to learn more while playing with others. We will experiment with basic strums, alternate chords and how to move from one chord to the next. We will play songs slowly at first and then again, only faster. </p> <p><br/>The group will decide what songs they want to play using \"The Daily Ukulele 365 Songs for Better Living,\" by Liz and Jim Beloff. This book is available from local music stores and on line. </p> <p><br/>Bring your ukulele and a floor music stand along with the music book. If you want to play songs other than what is in this book please notify the group the week prior so copies can be made. </p> <p><br/>As the group progresses, we will introduce the group to more advanced players and more challenging music selections. </p> <p><br/>If you have any questions, please contact Patty Williams at [masked].</p>",

'What does Orgasm mean to you?' and 'What's one secret desire you have?'</p> <p>Questions like these encourage vulnerability. And, what happens when you get vulnerable? It creates intimacy... which is what we're all searching for!</p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real.</p> <p>At OneTaste we teach a wellness practice known as Orgasmic Meditation (OM for short.) The games we play at TurnON are designed to create the visceral sensation of OM, without having to actually do the practice (or remove any clothing!) - sort of like having the feeling of an incredible dessert without having consumed any of the calories.</p> <p>You can play and participate at whatever level feels comfortable to you!</p> <p>It's a friendly invitation to play and push your edges in a way that feels good.

The hope is to create a pipeline for future Masters and Grandmasters teams. All skill levels are welcome and encouraged to attend. You don't have to have any intention of playing on a future Masters or Grandmasters team. Just show up and have fun not chasing around 18 year olds for a change. We have the permit for the field every Tuesday through August 11.

      "description": "<p>Open Discussion Nights are donation based events SparkleDragon and I (Rebekah Gamble, Holistic Practitioner) are bringing to the community once or twice a month in the interest of building community and public education. For the time that the event runs, I will be available to discuss a pre-chosen topic with you one on one and with whomever is in the group that evening.</p> <p>This month we're repeating one we had last month because it was so much fun! These events are very informal and consist of participants sitting together, having the space to share experiences and ask questions, and of course drinking tea, graciously provided by the Emporium.</p> <p>This event is not a formal presentation, but I will be bringing many of my tools and work from the Andes to the event. You can pet a baby llama, see an alter piece, hold tools and play a drum made by shamans in the jungle, take a look at photos, listen to music from an ayahuasca ceremony, hold the leaves from a sacred plant and touch the feathers of the condor. I will also be talking about the things I've learned in the temples and sacred sites in Peru and Bolivia, including Coricancha, Saqsayhuaman, Machu Pichu, Ollantaytambo, Wiracocha, Tiahuanaco, Puma Punko, the Sacred Valley and the valley of Tinanjani. I will also be sharing my personal experiences with the healing of the Andean teachings, Coca leaf work, and Wachuma.</p> <p>I met my second teacher in the Andean tradition for this work and he has authorized me to speak to you on these topics. His name is Jhaimy and you can contact him here if you wish to verify this information: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jhaimy.alvarezacosta?fref=ts\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/jhaimy.alvarezacosta?fref=ts</a></p> <p>I will share with you everything I can (because I love you!). My other qualifications in medicine ways don't matter, but if you're curious ask and I'll answer. You can also check out my website for more info on me an what I do: <a href=\"http://rebekahgambleholisticpractitioner.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://rebekahgambleholisticpractitioner.com/</a></p> <p>This event is being offered without charge in the interest of building a healthy community, but if you'd like to support my work and the shop, donations of $5-$10 are happily accepted and are split between the two hosts. There is no end time because we could talk for hours. The event will end when we're bored or tired, it gets very late, or it simply seems done. Feel free to come in or leave at any time during the event, we won't think any less of you. :-)</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you there!</p>",

      "description": "<p>Open Discussion Nights are donation based events SparkleDragon and I (Rebekah Gamble, Holistic Practitioner) are bringing to the community once or twice a month in the interest of building community and public education. For the time that the event runs, I will be available to discuss a pre-chosen topic with you one on one and with whomever is in the group that evening.</p> <p>This month we're repeating one we had last month because it was so much fun! These events are very informal and consist of participants sitting together, having the space to share experiences and ask questions, and of course drinking tea, graciously provided by the Emporium.</p> <p>This event is not a formal presentation, but I will be bringing many of my tools and work from the Andes to the event. You can pet a baby llama, see an alter piece, hold tools and play a drum made by shamans in the jungle, take a look at photos, listen to music from an ayahuasca ceremony, hold the leaves from a sacred plant and touch the feathers of the condor. I will also be talking about the things I've learned in the temples and sacred sites in Peru and Bolivia, including Coricancha, Saqsayhuaman, Machu Pichu, Ollantaytambo, Wiracocha, Tiahuanaco, Puma Punko, the Sacred Valley and the valley of Tinanjani. I will also be sharing my personal experiences with the healing of the Andean teachings, Coca leaf work, and Wachuma.</p> <p>I met my second teacher in the Andean tradition for this work and he has authorized me to speak to you on these topics. His name is Jhaimy and you can contact him here if you wish to verify this information: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jhaimy.alvarezacosta?fref=ts\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/jhaimy.alvarezacosta?fref=ts</a></p> <p>I will share with you everything I can (because I love you!). My other qualifications in medicine ways don't matter, but if you're curious ask and I'll answer. You can also check out my website for more info on me an what I do: <a href=\"http://rebekahgambleholisticpractitioner.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://rebekahgambleholisticpractitioner.com/</a></p> <p>This event is being offered without charge in the interest of building a healthy community, but if you'd like to support my work and the shop, donations of $5 are happily accepted and are split between the two hosts. There is no end time because we could talk for hours. The event will end when we're bored or tired, it gets very late, or it simply seems done. Feel free to come in or leave at any time during the event, we won't think any less of you. :-)</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you there!</p>",

The American Civil War has been going for 17 years with<br/>no end in sight, and now being fought with steam-powered<br/>tanks, flying machines, and man-portable Gatling rifles. The Quake of<br/> smashed California into a labyrinth of shattered plateaus and<br/>treacherous rapids known as the \"Great Maze\", and the Sioux Nations<br/>have reclaimed the Dakotas.<br/> Rumors have spread across the nation that the West is beset by<br/>everything from giant, man-eating bats to the walking dead, and while<br/>people in more civilized parts of the continent think  all<br/>bunk,  mostly because the Union and Confederate governments<br/>have done their best to hide the facts from them: truth is, magic and<br/>monsters are very, very real, and there are larger forces behind their<br/>sudden return.<br/> Anyone is free to join, regardless of prior experience: just walk in<br/>and ask. I can be contacted through my e-mail or at[masked] (aim<br/>for 11:30 AM to 5:30 PM) and am happy to help with character creation,<br/>take suggestions on what mood or tone you would like to see in the<br/>game, and answer questions.</p>",

If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.</p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.</p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.</p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br/>  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>  Jason,</p>",

      "description": "<p>Cross posting from another meetup. Not exactly volleyball, but it's good practice.</p> <p><br/>So what's Spikeball!? Well, it's a new game sweeping across college campuses, beaches, and yards everywhere. Many describe it as a cross between volleyball and four square. Here's the skinny: Using just a ball and net/trampoline, the object is to win points where you or your teammate have up to 3 hits before you spike the ball into net, while not letting the ball touch the ground. Simple! However you describe it, it's 2-on-2 fast-paced fun. We can get into the specific rules for the beginners and curious alike and hopefully get some games going.</p> <p>\n\n\n\nWe'll setup shop in the field by the turnaround on Overlook Drive in Schenley Park, just passed the tennis courts.</p>",

      "description": "<p>So what's Spikeball!? Well, it's a new game sweeping across college campuses, beaches, and yards everywhere. Many describe it as a cross between volleyball and four square. Here's the skinny: Using just a ball and net/trampoline, the object is to win points where you or your teammate have up to 3 hits before you must spike the ball into net, while not letting the ball touch the ground. Simple! However you describe it, it's 2-on-2 fast-paced fun. We can get into the specific rules for the beginners and curious alike and hopefully get some games going.</p> <p>\n\n\n\nWe'll have a few nets and setup shop in the field by the turnaround on Overlook Drive in Schenley Park, just passed the tennis courts.</p>",

Your spirit has its own presence, a unique vibration that’s totally distinct from your personality. The best way to connect with your own spirit is to start recognizing what makes you come alive.</p> <p>We will explore what your unique spirit is really like. How would you describe the eternal, fiery life force call you?</p> <p>Next we will begin to notice what feeds your spirit. That is, what experiences, activities, and energies give you strength and fortify and nourish you at the core, leaving you feeling satisfied, content with life, and comfortable in your own skin? What delights and surprises you, draws you into life, helping you embrace it head on; and brings you to peace with yourself?</p> <p>This meet-up promises to be a fun and enlightening experience. Hope to see you there!</p> <p>Love and Blessings,</p> <p>Joe</p>",

      "description": "<p><b>Proficiency Level</b><br/>Intermediate</p> <p>To combat both the inherent and user-induced weaknesses of text-based passwords, administrators and organizations typically institute a series of rules – a password policy – to which users must adhere when choosing a password. While a properly-written password policy might provide an organization with increased security, it is unclear just what such a well-written policy would be, or even how to determine whether a given policy is effective. Although it is easy to calculate the theoretical password space that corresponds to a particular password policy, it is difficult to determine the practical password space. Users may, for example, react to a policy rule requiring them to include numbers in passwords by overwhelmingly picking the same number, or by always using the number in the same location in their passwords. In addition, some password policies, while resulting in stronger passwords, may make those passwords difficult to remember or type. This may cause users to forget their passwords or to engage in a variety of behaviors that might compromise the security of passwords. We seek to advance understanding of the factors that make following password policies difficult, collect empirical data on password strength and memorability under various password policies, and propose password policy guidelines to simultaneously maximize security and usability of passwords. To that end, our research group has conducted a series of online studies in which we asked tens of thousands of people to create passwords that comply with specific password policies. We developed an efficient method for calculating how effectively several password-guessing algorithms guess passwords and used it to analyze leaked password sets, passwords created for our studies, and the single-sign-on passwords used by over 25,000 faculty, staff, and students at our university. We investigated a variety of password policies, including those with requirements on length and character classes, as well as exclusion of blacklisted words. We also investigated system-assigned passphrases and the impact of various password meter designs on password security and usability. In this talk I will describe our password research study methodology and highlight some of our most interesting findings.

Washington Senators fan Joe Boyd wishes his team had a great hitter, and, in a Faustian deal with the devil (and the devil's assistant, Lola), becomes the team's savior—until he has second thoughts and tries to return to his previous life. The action is propelled by great songs such as \"You Gotta Have Heart\" and \"Whatever Lola Wants.\" Think you already know Damn Yankees? Think again, because SummerFest puts a new spin on the ball in a role-reversed version of this classic favorite. </p> <p>Arrive early for each performance for tailgate-style food options (hotdogs for $3 and hamburgers for $5, served with a side of homemade potato chips!) available for purchase starting one hour before curtain time - no reservations necessary!</p> <p><br/>For more details on this production, please visit<br/><a href=\"http://otsummerfest.org/events/damn-yankees\" class=\"linkified\">http://otsummerfest.org/events/damn-yankees</a></p> <p><br/><b>Other Performance Dates: </b><br/>• Saturday 11 July at 7:30 pm<br/>• Sunday 12 July at 2:00 pm<br/>• Friday 17 July at 7:30 pm<br/>• Saturday 25 July at 2:00 pm<br/>• Saturday 01 August at 2:00 pm</p> <p><br/><b>Pre-Curtain Talks </b><br/>Join us one hour before curtain time for an informal and informative talk with members of the Damn Yankees creative team.

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.</p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.</p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.</p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.</p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br/>  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>  Jason,</p>",

      "description": "<p>Join us at Drinking Skeptically with our friends from the Steel City Skeptics and share a drink!</p> <p>Drinking Skeptically is an informal social event designed to promote fellowship and networking among skeptics, atheists, humanists, critical-thinkers, and like-minded individuals. There is no specific topic. It is just an open discussion among fellow freethinkers about science, religion, skepticism, beer, life and leisure. Both teetotalers and those who imbibe moderately are equally welcomed. We generally meet the third or fourth Friday of each month, skipping August and December. We will return our favorite summer location at the Hofbräuhaus Pittsburgh. Go through the restaurant, out the back and down the stairs to the Beer Garden along the river. Look for Drinking Skeptically signs on the tables. We start gathering at 7 pm, but latecomers are more than welcome. Hope to see you on Friday night!</p>",

      "description": "<p>We're going to run kickball every OTHER Saturday but I'm going to try to run some other events during the off-weeks.  Big Ball is more fun than it looks.  Check out the details below.  No spikes or cleats are permitted for this game.  Come join us for this unique but fun game!</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/f/1/a/600_388288442.jpeg\" /></p> <p>This game got quite popular last year and was requested as our Meetup of the week for 7 straight weeks.   </p> <p>The name of the game is Big Ball. I created this game during my junior year at IUP. The best way to describe the game is that it's a mix between Soccer and Ultimate Frisbee but we use a ball that's about 45\" in diameter. We played it every week for 2 years on the practice soccer field. There is no physical contact with other players permitted but you can use the ball however you want. Any part of your body can touch the ball and there's no height limit on the goals. Also, NO CLEATS OR SPIKES ALLOWED!</p> <p><br/>To see a video of this game in action from 3 years ago, check it out here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deBQzfRsBg0\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deBQzfRsBg0\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deBQzfRsBg0</a></a></p> <p>We will be playing this game at Armstrong Field near 12th St and Sarah St.</p> <p>Here are some more details &amp; rules.</p> <p>Field size we need is about 60 - 70 yards based on how many players we get (best games are at least 7 vs 7)</p> <p>There are 3 lines that matter in the game...the goal line on each side and the line at the center of the field. There are no out of bounds lines on the sides of the field.</p> <p>Players can dribble, roll, kick, throw or carry the ball for 3 steps</p> <p>The goals are 12 feet wide and there is no height limit on the goal. The game relies heavily on defense. There are also no regulations for goalies or a goalie box. This means your goalie can play mid field if he wants or you can even have 3 goalies...they can even piggyback on each other to be \"taller\" if they want. You just lose those additional players in the field</p> <p>Both teams start the game and after each goal at mid-field. The team that wins the coin toss or just got scored on start with the ball. As soon as anything crosses mid-field (the ball OR one of your players that's getting a running start) the other team is allowed to cross the line and start playing defense.</p> <p>As mentioned above, there is no physical contact with other players but you can use the ball however you want. If you're in the process of taking your 3 steps you can plow people over with the ball. If someone is charging you, you can kick the ball at them, you can hit people with the ball...I just prefer you don't aim for the head.</p> <p>If you do actually blatantly contact someone you get a warning and a 2 minute penalty. Second offense in the same game gets you ejected from the game. This only happened once in 2 years of playing as the ball does a good enough job of not getting players TOO close to each other...</p> <p>The ball is built like an exercise ball but it's VERY heavy. I would strongly advise players not try to punch the ball while it's in the air, hit it with one arm or kick it with your feet as it could easily result in an injury or twisting of the body. On that note, it's easiest to \"kick\" the ball with your knees or thigh, hit it with two hands punching close together or hit with the forearms while hands are clenched at the fists.</p> <p>We sometimes have players get into a \"scrum\" around the ball and it doesn't move for a while. If that happens and the ball doesn't move for 3 - 5 seconds we'll have a jump ball from where the \"scrum\" took place.</p> <p>Games are normally played until 11 and we switch sides of the field when one team scores 6. We usually take a little half-time break at that point too.</p> <p>We have had many girls play the sport and they loved it.  A few of them even had trouble picking the ball up but they still loved the game. Some of them were actually our most die-hard players.</p> <p>We normally start every game kicking and throwing the ball in a circle to get everyone warmed up for how big and heavy the ball actually is</p> <p>The game is actually the most fun in the rain because of our most important rule...</p> <p>NO CLEATS OR SPIKES OF ANY KIND! All players must wear tennis shoes or some other kind of non-grip shoe so they don't have any advantage in the dirt or grass. That's the way we've always played and I feel that makes everyone very even when it comes to maneuverability on the field. You can only imagine what some rain, puddles and slick grass add to a game where no one has traction. Good times.</p> <p>Join us on Saturday, July 18th at noon at Armstrong Field in the South Side for a game of Big Ball.  Just show up to the park to play and bring some friends.  Don't forget the number one rule...No SPIKES!</p>",

It may or may not be already taken that day, but there is a large area all around it that we can use if we need to!)</p> <p><br/>It'll be laid-back, nothing required but just to show up!  If you're feeling up for it, feel free to bring a snack (for yourself or to share!)  and I will be providing cold water for all!</p> <p>We can all take a little plant walk stroll around the park a bit too if we feel so inclined.</p> <p><br/>I may work out a few activities for us to do and appreciate any input &amp; thoughts!   (So far I'm thinking maybe a short plant walk, a brief or more in-depth discussion of the past and present of Boyce-Mayview Park, possibly a short \"how to make your own medicines\" basics talk, a \"botany basics\" talk, an \"invasive\" plant talk, and....????)  My wheels are spinning, and let me know if yours are too!</p> <p>If we have enough ideas and enough interest, we can definitely make for an earlier start time to fit it all in!</p> <p>I'd just really like to get all of you beautiful people together in the community spirit.</p> <p>Come on out!  This isn't to be missed!</p>",

Saturday Night Fever theme!<br/>Edit Cancel Print ticket Export Tell a friend Share<br/>Saturday, July 18, 2015<br/>6:00 PM to 10:00 PM<br/>Pittsburgh Dance Center<br/>4765 Liberty Ave., Pittsburgh, PA (edit map)</p> <p>Please join us as we continue the 'Dance Lesson, Wine Session' series at the Pittsburgh Dance Center located in the heart of Bloomfield.</p> <p>Between 6-6:30 pm, we will start with byowine tasting and entertainment by PDC Aerial Silks Performers. Light snacks and refreshments will also be provided.</p> <p>However, people also have the option to meetup beforehand for happy hour specials at one of the many options in Bloomfield. Please post comments below if anyone would like to meet earlier (perhaps 5-6 PM) or have some suggestions of favorite bar/restaurant in Bloomfield to check out before going to the PDC.</p> <p>Around 6:45 PM, there will be an introductory Hustle class to get the dance started. The first lesson will be followed by a break so the group may enjoy more food/wine and socializing --- and we'll be playing a number of disco and 70's dance favorites to continue dancing until around 10 PM. Of course requests for other types of dances/songs are always welcome. Like the previous dances, we will have a chance to change partners so we all get to meet and have a chance to dance so it is not necessary to bring a partner although everyone is certainly welcome to invite friends.</p> <p>The fun dance lessons will be suitable for beginners, with all levels welcome. The doors will open around 6 PM so we'll have a bit more time for socializing before the first lesson begins.</p> <p>The dance class/evening is only $10. What a great deal!!</p> <p>As a reminder, this event is BYOwine which has been so popular in the past as guests have a chance to try so many different wines! Please wear something comfortable -- or surprise us with some Saturday Night Fever attire!</p> <p>With so many people in the Meetup, sometimes it can be challenge meeting/mingling, especially for relatively new members when attending other events at busy art galleries, outdoor festivals, and performances at large venues such as the Benedum. So perhaps a series of fun activities that bring lots of people together would also help with introductions and spotting other members at future events.</p> <p>After the socializing period and PDC Aerial Silks performance, we will have the first hustle lesson around 6:45 PM.</p> <p>After the first 30-minute lesson, people will have the option to continue dancing until around 10 PM or simply enjoy more wines, snacks, good conversation, and lots of laughs. There will also be a hustle line dance lesson as well later in the night if the crowd is into it. And there will even be mini-class lessons to some of your favorite beats for those that are interested!!</p> <p>This will be a fantastic event bringing people together -- Meetup groups, PDC clients, and dance enthusiasts.</p> <p>This 'Dance Lesson, Wine Session' series has been a lot of fun (for those that may have attended the earlier Meetup events last year on April 3, May 8, June 29, August 24, September 25, October 26, November 16, December 21, or earlier this year on January 31, March 20, May 1, June 5) -- so having it with the Saturday Night Fever theme should be a great time for everyone.</p> <p>While Pittsburgh has a vibrant cultural scene, including classical and contemporary dance, this is our chance to experience being a bit more than spectators while learning more about the art of dance.</p> <p>Unlike a restaurant where people spend most of the time talking with those seated nearby, the 'Dance Lesson, Wine Lesson' will be less formal so people should be able to meet many others while enjoying the group dance lesson and sharing wine.</p> <p>While there are other Meetup groups and organizations in the region that are specifically focused on dance, this event is also an opportunity for people to see if they might enjoy taking up dance in a relaxed, informal atmosphere. Because some might be more comfortable bringing a friend for the dance lesson, guests are certainly welcome. So when you RSVP, please indicate if you'll bringing one or more friends.</p> <p>This event costs only $10/person -- please bring cash at the door -- and is BYOwine.<br/>But to make the wine appreciation session more interesting, please feel free to bring one of your favorite bottles of wine -- or perhaps something you've never tried before -- with an emphasis on value wines in the $12/bottle range.<br/>For those that live close to the larger state stores, this might be a chance to check out one of the Chairmen's Selection wines.</p> <p>It would be fantastic if this event included a variety of wines for the group to try.</p> <p>And if you don't drink, that is certainly OK as this event is about having fun, bringing lots of people together, and learning a little more about ballroom dance. We hope to see everyone on Saturday, July 18!</p> <p>For more information on the Pittsburgh Dance Center, please visit <a href=\"http://www.pittsburghdancecenter.com\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.pittsburghdancecenter.com</a></p> <p>Note -- People also gave the option to meetup beforehand for happy hour specials at one of the many options in Bloomfield.

(The proceeds are only about 10% of sales.  It probably won't amount to much, but every little bit will help the group.)</p> <p>Post your designs, as many as you wish, to the album on or before Sept 30.  (If you have a design idea, but don't have the skills to use necessary software, see an alternative below.)</p> <p><br/>After Sept 30th, we will send an email to explain how members can vote to choose a logo design from those posted.</p> <p><b>Requirements for the design:</b></p> <p><br/><b>Minimum size should be 9\"X12\" at 300ppi, portrait or landscape format, or a square or round design that is at least 12\"X12\".</b></p> <p><br/><b>Each should include the text \"Pittsburgh Photo Safari Meetup\"</b> prominently in the design. </p> <p>You can create a traditional photographic-themed image or an iconic image of Pittsburgh, or you can let your imagination run wild.  Another possibility is to create a generic design into which each member could place his/her own photo image.</p> <p><br/>Use your own photo(s), your manipulated photo(s), your own illustration, graphic design, or cartoon. If you use clip art or stock photos, make sure you have the right to use them royalty-free. If a person is recognizable, make sure you have a model release. (Do not use Pgh sports-team logos or images. They are copyrighted and aggressively protected.) </p> <p>The design should look good on white or light-colored shirts. On colored shirts, white areas will be blank so the color of the shirt will show through. (Later, we may ask the creator of the chosen design to come up with an alternative for dark shirts where white will be printed in white ink.)  </p> <p>If you use software that includes layers, please keep at least one copy with all your layers so we can easily tweak the design, if necessary. If, for example, you use Photoshop, save one copy in Photoshop format, preserving your layers. </p> <p>If the background will be blank, it is best to save another copy in png format.  If the background will be part of the design you can save it in jpg as well as the Photoshop copy.  Optional, if you want to post your image in a smaller format online, you can save it again in a smaller jpg format to post in this album. Eventually the chosen image will be emailed to me to post at zazzle.com. If it is too large to email, it can be mailed to me on a CD or DVD. </p> <p><b>Alternative: If you have a great design idea, but you don't have the skill to use Photoshop, Illustrator or other software to perfect it</b>, post a photo, a sketch (rough or detailed) or even a scan of a similar logo you've seen.  In a caption or comment, suggest that others with the necessary skills use it as a starting point to create a group logo. Explain your idea more fully in a comment, if necessary. State clearly that you are giving permission for others to use your idea.</p> <p>If you have an iconic image of Pittsburgh which you are willing to offer for use in a design, post it with a caption or comment giving permission for others to use it in a logo.</p> <p><b>If you run with a photo or design idea posted by someone else</b>, please add a caption \"From a design idea (or photo) by ______\" so the credit will go to both of you. DO NOT use someone else's photo or design unless the member has stated that others have permission to use it.</p> <p>_____________</p> <p>Zazzle.com is a great place for you to sell your own work, too. You can set up your own store to create products for yourself or to sell your photos or art work as prints, greeting cards, postcards, and a zillion other products (T-shirts, mugs, caps, mousepads, notebook covers, tote bags, iPhone covers, real postage stamps, stationary, neckties, flip-flops, skate boards, and much more.) </p>",

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.</p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.</p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.</p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.</p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br/>  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>  Jason,</p>",

      "description": "<p>The July assembly is coming soon! The theme of the month will be \"Humanism\" - what it is, and what it can be. When asked to describe Humanism, self identifying humanists are often at a loss for words. The concept itself is a bit nebulous, and lacks clarity in the broader culture. How can we best understand and describe Humanism as a life philosophy? What are its key principles or components? What does it mean to be Humanist, anyway?  </p> <p>Our speaker, Akshat Gupta from the Carnegie Mellon Humanist League, will attempt to answer some of these questions that nag the Humanist community by proposing three simple components that allow us to understand and describe Humanism as a coherent philosophical worldview and social movement.</p> <p>As usual we will be rocking out to music, building community, eating cookies, and drinking tea!</p> <p>We’re always looking for people to get involved! If you’re interested in speaking, leading a song, or doing a reading for a future assembly, send our content coordinator Alex an email at [masked]</p>",

      "description": "<p>St. Mary was founded in 1855 as a German parish. The origin of the parish can be traced to the settling of German farmers next to Chartiers Creek in the 1840's.

By 1855, enough Catholic families had settled in the area to make the establishment of a parish feasible. In that year, the bishop granted their petition for a parish. The parish outgrew two previous churches before purchasing land and relocating to its present location to build the third church that we see today.</p> <p>William P. Ginther was commissioned to design the new church. William P. Ginther (FAIA) (1858–1933) was an American architect based in Akron, Ohio. He was a prolific designer of Roman Catholic churches, schools and rectories throughout Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, California, Virginia and New York. In Pittsburgh, Ginther also designed the Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Polish Hill and Saint Philip Church in Crafton.</p> <p>With its stone trim, twin Gothic steeples and German stained-glass windows, Saint Mary Church is a quintessential Ginther-designed architectural treasure.

Had so much fun at the super successful Verde dinner so I wanted to do another great MeetUp where us plant-powered folks normally can't - A FARM DINNER!!! I am doing a Churchview Farm Dinner this summer and early bird tickets are now available! For $95, it will be a 5-8 course dinner with pairings, enjoying the full bounty of the farm season. This would be a perfect gift for the holiday season. I'm already planning a menu and I promise that it will be phenomenal. It's the only vegan farm dinner in Pittsburgh and I'm so honored to be invited to do it!</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/a/9/8/600_432207288.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Come one, come all! Let's hang out again! There are ONLY 45 seats available (we had over 150 people come to the Verde dinner!) This is also a more intimate venue than Verde, where we had a tough time trying to find the Pgh Vegan Meetup folks. This time, I'm going to reserve a section for the MeetUp so we can all be near each other (unless we take over the entire dinner :) Thanks all and I hope to see you there! Happy holidays!</p> <p><a href=\"https://churchviewfarmpgh.squarespace.com/dinners/\" class=\"linkified\">https://churchviewfarmpgh.squarespace.com/dinners/</a></p>",

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.</p> <p>2.

Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.</p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.</p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p> <p>6.

Try it -- it's fun!</p> <p>Music is usually selected from \"The Daily Ukulele... 365 Songs for Better Living,\" by Liz and Jim Beloff. This book is readily available at music stores, book stores, and Amazon.com. Sometimes members bring other music to play (bring 15 copies to share). We play at a large conference table, so bring a table-top music stand if you have one.</p> <p>Snacks and libations to share are welcome.</p> <p>For more information, contact Sandy at [masked]</p> <p>Directions to the Church: Take I279 North to Wexford exit. Turn right at the end of the exit. Right at the light onto Brandt School Road. Right onto West Ingomar Road to 2359. Note - watch for the large sign for the Church and then you will follow a narrow roadway back through the trees to the Church.</p> <p>Depending on where you start, there may be a better route to the Church. Please check your GPS for different directions. </p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/e/c/600_344880492.jpeg\" /></p>",

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.</p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.</p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.</p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.</p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br/>  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>  Jason,</p>",

Folks begin arriving around 5PM, and play begins table by table as soon as we have three or four players plus a set.  (We usually have 3-5 tables.)  By 6:15 or so, most players have arrived. We rotate among the tables... at the end of each game, East walks around to see if another table is close to the end of their game, so that two players can swap places.   At the other end of the evening... play must end by 9PM when Panera closes.  Tables begin wrapping up play any time after 8:15 or so.</p> <p><br/>If you have never played, or if you have not played for a very long time, we highly recommend that you take a Mah Jong 101 beginner class before playing with us - beginner classes are offered every few months.  Mah jong is a wonderful game, but it's hard to learn by just watching others play!</p> <p><br/>Please order your 2015 card from the National Mah Jongg League, here: <a href=\"http://www.nationalmahjonggleague.org/\"><a href=\"http://www.nationalmahjonggleague.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.nationalmahjonggleague.org/</a></a> Amazon.com also carries the cards. Note that you want the NMJL card, and no other! (There are some colorful alternatives out there.. but we play NMJL card and rules.)</p> <p>Experienced players -- please bring your cards and please bring a set if you have one.</p> <p>Please do not bring any outside food or beverages into Panera!

      "description": "<p>Hello Book Lovers! For July, we chose Someday, Someday, Maybe by Lauren Graham (aka Lorelai and Sarah)</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/6/3/4/600_438998452.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Someday-Maybe-Novel-Lauren-Graham/dp/0345532767/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435057170&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=someday+someday+maybe&amp;pebp=1435057318570&amp;perid=0FTK7R8GWSVJD0BFYBST\">Amazon.com</a>:</p> <p>From Lauren Graham, the beloved star of Gilmore Girls and Parenthood, comes a witty, charming, and hilariously relatable debut novel about a struggling young actress trying to get ahead―and keep it together―in New York City. It’s January 1995, and Franny Banks has just six months left of the three-year deadline she set for herself when she came to New York, dreaming of Broadway and doing “important” work. But all she has to show for her efforts so far is a part in an ad for ugly Christmas sweaters, and a gig waiting tables at a comedy club. Her roommates―her best friend Jane, and Dan, an aspiring sci-fi writer―are supportive, yet Franny knows a two-person fan club doesn’t exactly count as success. Everyone tells her she needs a backup plan, and though she can almost picture moving back home and settling down with her perfectly nice ex-boyfriend, she’s not ready to give up on her goal of having a career like her idols Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep. Not just yet. But while she dreams of filling their shoes, in the meantime, she’d happily settle for a speaking part in almost anything—and finding a hair product combination that works. Everything is riding on the upcoming showcase for her acting class, where she’ll finally have a chance to perform for people who could actually hire her. And she can’t let herself be distracted by James Franklin, a notorious flirt and the most successful actor in her class, even though he’s suddenly started paying attention. Meanwhile, her bank account is rapidly dwindling, her father wants her to come home, and her agent doesn’t return her calls. But for some reason, she keeps believing that she just might get what she came for. Someday, Someday, Maybe is a story about hopes and dreams, being young in a city, and wanting something deeply, madly, desperately. It’s about finding love, finding yourself, and perhaps most difficult of all in New York City, finding an acting job.</p> <p><br/>Please ask at the host stand for the book club.

We'll meet at Coffee Tree Roasters in Shadyside to chat, drink coffee, and listen to music. Bring your favorite music on your phone or thumb drive to share -- you can even bring an instrument to play if you'd like. And you can just come for the coffee and company – you absolutely aren't required to bring music (I will bring my laptop to look things up on YouTube as well).</p> <p>Bring any music -- if you have music of your own creation, if you're passionate about a particular musician or band, or if you just like something and feel like sharing. It could be a recent find or something that influenced your childhood and got you though your teenage years. It could be something you love or it could even be something you hate -- just tell us why. Music is as much a story as anything -- it could be a story of you, or the story of the artist who created the music, or the story could be embedded in the song itself waiting for us to listen. Feel free to bring a story to share along with the music -- or not, if you prefer.</p> <p>We're totally open to any kind of music so, please, bring anything you'd like to share be it classical, ethnic, heavy metal, or whatever -- even classical ethnic heavy metal (I bet it exists). We'll be meeting at Coffee Tree Roasters from 7pm (to probably 9pm though the room's booked until 10pm).</p> <p>This event is also posted on <a href=\"http://www.meetin.org\">meetin.org</a>.</p>",

Were “some,” “many,” “most,” or “all” records destroyed? Were passenger lists destroyed or “only administrative” records? Some say State and municipal records were burned, but why would those records be at a Federal immigration station? Did we really lose anything in that fire? Join us for answers to these burning questions for New York passenger list research.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Imagine living in a reality where you have no real pressure to get anything done ... where you never age ... where you have all of eternity to attack your bucket list ... well, guess what? You do! Nearly a century ago, Albert Einstein formulated that time does not exist (at least not independent of space) and so many of his brilliant colleagues have enhanced that concept such that it is now a foregone conclusion: we are timeless. In this group we will review the science of \"eternity\" and process spiritual applications of what it means that time is an illusion.</p>",

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.</p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.</p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.</p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.</p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br/>  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>  Jason,</p>",

So much for that. But the spirit of Fight Club remains, the idea of trying to bring out the best in each other through the evolution of consciousness. As Brad Pitt said about the movie, \"Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it.\" And not fear the pain! In this meetup we discuss ways that concepts introduced during the Incito Veritas series can be applied to our daily lives. We will learn and grow as we process our experiences. Bottom line: Knowing and Not Doing is Not Knowing, or as it says in James 2:26, \"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead.\"</p>",

She’s here to hide out for a little while, not to form connections. Her survival depends on her ability to slip in and out of people’s lives, on never staying in one place for too long. </p> <p>But no one in Walton plans on making things easy for Suzanne. For one thing, it’s a town where everyone knows everyone else—and they all seem intent on making Suzanne feel right at home. For another, Suzanne can’t help but feel drawn to this tight-knit community—or to the town’s mayor, Joe Warner, and his six kids. But Suzanne can’t afford to stick around, even if she’s finally found a place where she belongs. Because someone is looking for her—someone who won’t stop until her life is destroyed… </p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/5/0/600_438944880.jpeg\" /></p>",

We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.</p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p> <p>6.

      "description": "<p>Let’s private-club hop in Oakland! The University Club rooftop terrace, with sweeping views of Oakland, is only open during select nights in the summer, and only to members. But we’re members and we’ve made arrangements to have you come as our guests before this opening performance of Figaro Redux!</p> <p><br/>We’re going to start at the U-Club around 5:30. Have bevs and bites (informal-buy as much or as little as you want) and walk over to the Twentieth Century Club two blocks away in plenty of time for the 7:30 pm curtain call.</p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/5/a/a/600_439714218.jpeg\" /></p> <p><i><b>About this progressive, shortened production of Marriage of Figaro: </b></i><br/>Not so sure about opera? Love music from Figaro, but have problems sitting all evening? Then Figaro Redux is for you! In our slightly shorter, edgier modern-dress version of \"The Marriage of Figaro\" (by Mozart), you'll follow the cast around the building (nursing a cocktail, if you like!), with each act set in a different space in the spectacular Twentieth Century Club.</p> <p><br/>This one is all about sex and class: it was banned when first written, and later launched the French Revolution. And it is just as radical and subversive and entertaining today as it was back then.</p> <p><br/><i><b>More details on this production: </b></i><br/><a href=\"http://otsummerfest.org/events/figaro-redux\" class=\"linkified\">http://otsummerfest.org/events/figaro-redux</a></p> <p><i><b>One other performance: </b></i><br/>• Thursday 30 July at 7:30 pm</p> <p><br/><i><b>Want traditional Figaro?</b></i> Still two more chances July 19 (7:30) and August 1 (2pm)</p> <p><br/><i><b>Trib review of July 11 Marriage of Figaro opening:</b></i></p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://triblive.com/aande/music/8710170-74/figaro-mozart-production#axzz3fpAlVPdo\"><a href=\"http://triblive.com/aande/music/8710170-74/figaro-mozart-production#axzz3fpAlVPdo\" class=\"linkified\">http://triblive.com/aande/music/8710170-74/figaro-mozart-production#axzz3fpAlVPdo</a></a></p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/6/6/600_439715174.jpeg\" /></p> <p><i><b>Pre-Curtain Talks </b></i></p> <p>One hour before curtain time is an informal and informative talk with members of the Figaro Redux creative team.

It is our honor to host District 13's Champion, Michael Stanley, as he prepares for the competition by delivering his finals speech to the club. Michael will be competing in the semifinals with his award winning speech that we heard at our club's kick-off meeting on June 11th. If he wins that round, he will compete 2 days later in the finals with a completely different speech! Come hear Michael's speech that he hopes to present on the World Championship stage in Las Vegas in just a few short weeks. Give him your valuable feedback and help him bring the trophy home to Pittsburgh! </p> <p>\n\n\nAbout the Club:</p> <p>There are over 50,000 residents living in Pittsburgh's Northside neighborhoods and until now there have been no open Toastmasters clubs for these communities. </p> <p>That changes with the establishment of the Northside Toastmasters to serve the community and develop its current and future leaders. In our meetings, members present prepared speeches, receive written and oral evaluations, practice impromptu speaking, and share fellowship in a supportive, non-intimidating environment. These experiences develop our members into greater communicators while practicing essential leadership skills. </p> <p>Toastmasters is a safe place to fail, to practice, to learn, and to grow into the best leader and communicator you can be.

Remember, you need not have completed the entire book to attend, even if it is just a few chapters, pick what stood out, and share.  I will have two discussion questions to get us started.  I will have a date picked soon, just wanted to give you the title to start the book, it is also on Kindle.   Happy Reading!</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/3/e/5/600_438673285.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b><i>Overview<br/>“A true writer.” –Beth Moore</i></b></p> <p><b><i>From a challenge of faith to a means of transformation</i></b></p> <p><b><i>Did God really say you couldn’t eat from any tree in the garden? This seed of doubt planted so long ago still bears the fruit of fear on some level every day—the idea that our actions could ruin something beautiful and God might not have control over things.</i></b></p> <p><b><i>In What Women Fear acclaimed writer and speaker Angie Smith admits, “Fear is a major part of my testimony” as she talks openly about significant struggles she has experienced. Giving a voice to the problem, she says, “I truly believe every single one of us struggles with some type of fear, whether it’s fear of flying or fear of being ‘found out.’ Maybe you don’t worry about dying, but you get sick thinking about the fact that you might fail.”</i></b></p> <p><b><i>Instead of suggesting that those who love the Lord would never fear, Angie blends her own experiences with those of men and women throughout Scripture to help us start dealing more effectively with these true, human emotions.</i></b></p> <p><b><i>Whether it’s a constant What if? type of worry, being afraid of abandonment or betrayal, fear of trusting God’s plan, or many others encountered in the rhythm of our daily lives, Angie walks you through stories of others who have simultaneously loved God and struggled with faith. Journey with her as she explores the difficult and life-giving questions God asked of those who walked a similar road. Discover how to redeem this struggle as only God can—that He will be glorified, and you will be transformed.</i></b></p> <p><b><i>Angie Smith is the wife of Todd Smith (lead singer of Dove Award winning group Selah), author of I Will Carry You, and a national women’s conference speaker. She holds a Master’s degree in Developmental Psychology from Vanderbilt University and lives with her husband and daughters in Nashville, Tennessee.</i></b></p> <p><b><i></p> <p></i></b></p>",

      "description": "<p>Don't miss this opportunity to learn from an expert all the first-aid supplies you'll need for your next outdoor adventure. We'll start by focusing on the five basic variables to consider when building a first-aid kit: group size, trip length and distance, potential injuries and illnesses, specific medical conditions and your own medical knowledge and skills. Plus, we'll discuss the benefits of assemble-it-yourself first-aid kits vs. pre-assembled kits. You'll also participate in a hands-on, small-group discussion of the contents needed for a first-aid kit based on three different outing scenarios. You'll assess the needs of each kit based on the first three basic variables outlined earlier in the clinic. Afterwards, the whole group will come together to discuss what first-aid materials would be needed for each scenario. Our experts will also briefly explain the purpose for each item in the kit. They also discuss where it should be placed, so it can be quickly located during stressful emergency situations. Please note: This is not a first-aid certification class. Proper first-aid training is very important for knowing what to do in emergency situations. You should only attempt first aid when you feel comfortable giving it.</p> <p><br/>Thank you for your interest in our free \"First Aid Kits Clinic.\" L.L.Bean has a new <b>centralized reservation system</b>.

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland features familiar characters from Lewis Carroll's novel...with a twist. </p> <p><b>SYNOPSIS: </b></p> <p>Alice, an innocent Catholic schoolgirl, is lured away from a field trip by a mischievous punk, the \"White\" Rabbit. She pursues him and finds herself in “Wonderland,” a seedy area of the city populated by a host of re-imagined, real-world counterparts to Carroll's beloved characters. Favorites such as the Caterpillar, the Cheshire Cat, and the Queen of Hearts appear in Alice’s world, but not as audiences may expect—instead, we find a victim of Alzheimer's Disease, a drug addict with a smile that just won't quit, and a dominatrix with her own bondage club.</p> <p><br/><i><b>Mature content, not advisable for younger audience members.</b></i></p> <p>Come follow us down the rabbit hole July 23, 24, &amp; 25 at 8:00 PM at Mckeesport Little Theater.</p> <p><b>Tickets $15.00 (Cash at the door) -- But Please Call for reservations (724)[masked] as these performances may sell out.</b></p> <p>To learn more about The Rage of Stage Players, please visit <a href=\"http://rageofthestage.com/\"><a href=\"http://rageofthestage.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://rageofthestage.com/</a></a></p> <p>Check out this great review of the show <a href=\"http://www.pghstage.com/drupal_old/node/606\"><a href=\"http://www.pghstage.com/drupal_old/node/606\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.pghstage.com/drupal_old/node/606</a></a></p> <p><b>For more information about this Production</b></p> <p>Celebrating the 150th anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LewisCarrollAuthor\">Lewis Carroll</a>'s beloved book of the same name, The Rage of the Stage Players proudly announce the Pittsburgh return of their gritty, urban stage production, Alice's Adventures in “Wonderland,”</p> <p>Pittsburgh playwright James Michael Shoberg brings us a darker, modernized interpretation of Lewis Carroll's story about young Alice Liddell, \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" (1865). Although Shoberg's version is an edgier, more twisted adaptation of the story, Carroll's plot and poems remain intact. Fans of Carroll’s work will appreciate the numerous subtle references to characters and songs, as well as other hidden—and not-so-hidden—gems.</p> <p>Having been produced from coast-to-coast and internationally, this marks the third time the play will be seen in Pittsburgh.</p> <p>Previous Productions include:</p> <p>The Rage of the Stage Players - Pittsburgh, PA (September 2006)</p> <p>The Rage of the Stage Players - Pittsburgh, PA (May 2009)</p> <p>Paper Wing Theatre Company - Monterey, CA (April 2010)</p> <p>Adam Roebuck Studios - New York, NY (October 2011)</p> <p>Scorpio Theatre - Calgary, Canada (February 2012)</p> <p>Unquiet Theatre Company - Lorton, Virginia (February 2015)</p> <p>The Cuckoo’s Theater Project - Chicago, Illinois (March 2015)</p> <p><i><b>“Alice’s Adventures in ‘Wonderland’ is tailor made for the young, hip, adventurous wing of the Pittsburgh theater crowd.” </b>-- John Hayes, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i></p> <p><br/>To learn more about The Rage of the Stage Players, please visit <a href=\"http://rageofthestage.com/\"><a href=\"http://rageofthestage.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://rageofthestage.com/</a></a></p> <p>For more information about McKeesport Little Theater, please visit <a href=\"http://www.mckeesportlittletheater.com/\"><a href=\"http://www.mckeesportlittletheater.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.mckeesportlittletheater.com/</a></a></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>MEETUP Considerations</b></p> <p>When you RSVP, please consider posting comments below to indicate which performance date you prefer:</p> <p>    Thursday, July 23 at 8 PM</p> <p><br/>    Friday, July 24 at 8 PM</p> <p><br/>    Saturday, July 25 at 8 PM</p> <p><br/>As always, it is also fine if you wish to attend the show on your own with family/friends instead.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/0/b/e/600_440037534.jpeg\" /></p>",

Sat at 10AM Outback Adventures will shuttle us up to Tidioute for a 15 mile paddle down the Allegheny. It will be at least 5 hrs. With lunch and fishing and swimming will take the good part of the day. A few rapids nothing over class one. The river is a constant 3-4ft deep. We can have a leisurely paddle enjoying the sun and water, and float into our campground so no rush to get off the water. Everyone is responsible for their own food and drink for the weekend. There is a Subway in town that I have found convenient for packing lunch and snacks for Sat. Everyone should bring water shoes,sunscreen and a watertight bag for their phone or camera. A PFD if bringing their own kayak. The price for shuttling your own kayak is 19 dollars. The rental price is 38 dollars. We can then camp out Sat night again 5 dollars per person and leave Sun morning. I will have to make reservations ahead of time. Hoping for some bright sunny weather!</p> <p>* This meetup is cross posted on PALS*</p>",

Here are 5-6 that we will plan on talking about outside of what you bring:</p> <p>•  “Judge not, that you be not judged\" (Matthew 7:1). </p> <p>•  \"For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them” (Matthew 18:20). </p> <p>• \"And we know that God causes all things to work together for good...\" (Romans 8:28). </p> <p>• \"I can do all things through Him who strengthens me\" (Philippians 4:13).</p> <p>• \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life\" (John 3:16). </p> <p>• \"For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope\" (Jeremiah 29:11). </p> <p>• \"Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me\" (Revelation 3:20).</p>",

      "description": "<p><b>The Topic</b></p> <p><br/>Welcome to the 12th meeting of the Pittsburgh Apologetics Club. The topic for this meeting is, \"Calvinism and Free Will and The Problem of Evil\".</p> <p><br/>We will be continuing our discussion from last time about free will, specifically about the beliefs of Calvinists and other Christian denominations. If you remember we did not get a chance to discuss this last time because we ran out of time.</p> <p><br/>We will also be discussing The Problem of Evil. This is somewhat related to the free will topic. Did God create evil? Is evil necessary for good to exist? What is evil? What is good? Is there such a thing as objective good and objective evil? Can we be good without God? And other questions along the same lines.</p> <p><br/><b>What will we do</b></p> <p>As usual, we will watch a few videos related to the topics, and then go around the table and discuss the videos and topics in general as a group. As was suggested in the previous meeting, we will watch a video, discuss it, then watch another video, discuss it, and so on. <b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Important: Please follow the rules on this website during the meeting</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://ukranians2.wix.com/pgh-apologetics-club#%21meetup-group/cwzz\"><a href=\"http://ukranians2.wix.com/pgh-apologetics-club#!meetup-group/cwzz\" class=\"linkified\">http://ukranians2.wix.com/pgh-apologetics-club#!meetup-group/cwzz</a></a></p> <p>We had some problems during the last meeting because people failed to follow the rules. People got offended. Remember, these are challenging topics. Why don't you discuss religion and politics at the dinner table? Because it causes WW3 among your family members. This is a club where we discuss those topics and try to be civil about it. </p> <p>People have different opinions, and the only way we will get anywhere is if we respect each other and give each other a fair hearing, and <b>DO NOT</b> talk over someone else while they are speaking.</p>",

      "description": "<p>We had almost 25 players show up to Game 2 but we still didn't get to play on the dirt field because of a big puddle. Hopefully the weather improves so we can use the field as it was intended. Don't forget to bring some friends!</p> <p>I decided to check the World Adult Kickball Association (WAKA) (www.kickball.com) to verify the rules that we have been playing with. We definitely have some changes to make, starting with the field size we use. Even though our field came from a WAKA box, somehow they messed it up. According to the website, the field should be a diamond where all 4 sides are 60'. That's an extra 15' more than we used for Game 2. Apparently the game has changed a bit since its origination in Texas.</p> <p>Summarizing the information below that is different than how we've been playing:</p> <p>When playing on dirt, we're going to need each team to have a catcher. Pegging is allowed anywhere from the shoulders down unless the player is sliding, in which case head &amp; neck shots are permitted.</p> <p>Tagging is allowed anywhere.</p> <p>No leading...EVER. Even when there are 2 outs. Any player off a base when the ball is kicked is out.</p> <p>Any runner hit (shoulders or lower) by a ball when off a base is out.</p> <p>Four foul balls is an out. I only copied the rules that are different or confirming what we've done already. For the complete rules, visit www.kickball.com:</p> <p>a. the kickball diamond is a square with equal sides of 60 feet or about 20 paces with a base at each corner;<br/>b. the distance from home plate to second base and from first base to third base is 84 feet 10 1/4 inches or about<br/>28 paces. The distance between any base and home plate shall be measured from the back corner of each;<br/>c. the pitching strip is in the center of the diamond, 42 feet 5 1/8 inches or about 14 paces from home plate, and<br/>directly aligned with the 1st-3rd base diagonal;</p> <p>5.02 While fielding, each team must field at least eight (8) and no more than eleven (11) players, which must<br/>include one pitcher and one catcher at any time during the game.</p> <p>8.01 Balls must be pitched by hand. There are no restrictions on pitching style. 9.01 All kicks must be made by foot or leg, below the knee (see Rule 13.02e). Any ball touched by the foot or leg<br/>below the knee is a kick.</p> <p>c. When attempting to avoid a ball tag, runners may move no more than 4 feet out of their established path</p> <p>10.03 Neither leading off base, nor stealing a base is allowed. A runner may advance once the ball is kicked. A<br/>runner off base when the ball is kicked is out (see Rule 14.02g).</p> <p>10.04 Hitting a runner’s neck or head with the ball is not allowed, except when the runner is sliding. Any runner<br/>hit in the neck or head shall be considered safe at the base they were running toward when the ball hits the<br/>runner. If the runner intentionally uses the head or neck to block the ball, and is so called by the Referee, the<br/>runner is out. 10.06 All ties will go to the runner. Runners traveling from home plate may overrun first base, and may only be<br/>tagged out if actively attempting to advance to second base.</p> <p>13.01 A count of four (4) fouls is an out. Foul balls never count as strikes.</p> <p>14.02 An out is:<br/>d. a runner touched by the ball or who touches the ball at any time while not on base while the ball is in play;<br/>g. a runner off base when the ball is kicked (see Rule 10.03);</p> <p>15.01 Once the pitcher has the ball in control and retains possession on the mound, the play ends. Runners who<br/>are off base at this time and in forward motion may advance only one base. Runners who are off base at this<br/>time and not in forward motion must return to the base from which they were running.</p>",

HackPittsburgh will be holding an intermediate level class on building circuits and reading various types of sensors with the Arduino. The class will focus on devices that output voltage, current, or resistance including accelerometers, photodiodes, thermistors, and more! In order to integrate these devices we will cover the basics of voltage dividers, and wheatstone bridges.</p> <p><br/>As mentioned, this is NOT a beginner’s class. Those attending are expected to be able to write simple Arduino sketches without guidance and also be familiar with the basic concepts of a resistor and capacitor as well as voltage and current. You will need to bring a laptop and Arduino with all associated cables. Included in the ticket price, you will receive a variety of different sensors and the parts needed to hook them into your Arduino!</p> <p>Class is open to anyone, membership in HackPittsburgh is not required.</p> <p>You must bring: an Arduino, a laptop, and a cable to connect the two (varies depending on your Arduino).</p> <p>You will take home: a variety of different sensors and the parts needed to hook them into your Arduino!</p> <p>Date and Time: Saturday, July 25th, 2015 at 1:00pm</p> <p>Location: HackPittsburgh,[masked]th Avenue, the garage around back on Watson</p>",

We will have a different theme in a specific area of metaphysics every time.</p> <p>\n\n\nThe presenter: Mary Ann Brown</p> <p><br/>Mary Ann will share her unique metaphysical skills with us about physical alignment, balancing, clearing, healing and beyond. She will explain the various modalities she uses in her practice.

Creating balance allows the body to move in a more efficient pattern.</p> <p>The second theme is balancing through Therapeutic Essential oils. Therapeutic Essential oils are a way to balance the body.

      "description": "<p>This is a 2 part hike that starts in Mcbride Park in the Lincoln Place neighborhood of Pittsburgh, but takes place mostly in the wilds of West Mifflin. This is a small park so you just drive straight in, go past the pool and down the hill to the parking lot next to the shelter.<br/>I’ll start with a quick 10 minute tree identification review in the park, so we know what we’re seeing, and to give any late arrivals some more time.<br/>This is public, non-posted land, so dogs are welcome and no leash needed. This is not heavily forested, so everything gets a lot of sun. It’s basically comprised of 2 hills with a valley in between that is mostly a marsh – ok, so I took SOME poetic license. There are blackberry plants everywhere, and they are getting bigger and juicier every day now. That being said, the fruit can be somewhat sparse and hard to get to. So don’t come hungry, but don’t brush with tooth paste either!<br/>The trails are mostly wide and open. There are a couple of hills that are steep enough that you need to jog down. We’ll wade through the edge of a marsh full of cattails. FYI, the water and mud is ankle high. Then we’ll go by bullfrog pond where I’ve never failed to hear the unique bullfrog call.<br/>At times we’ll be going through some tall grass / plants. As far as ticks go, I’ve spent scores of hours in the woods this year without a problem, and my dog gets into everything and he hasn’t had a tick since the beginning of April. Of course, no guarantees……<br/>Time: 90 minutes</p> <p>Part 2<br/>We’ll drive less then 1 mile to have a very different experience in a nice and shady little hardwood forest with a lot of big beautiful trees. I take my dog here almost every day and I feel like it’s my own – I never see anybody - so I maintain my very own (and large) blackberry patch that is just starting to put out some big juicy berries. No GPS’s allowed !!!<br/>Time: 30 – 40 minutes<br/>Note: 885 at Mifflin Rd is closed. For anyone coming across the Homestead bridge.<br/>Go straight at end of bridge – West St. At T make Right on West Run Rd. At first light make Right at Interboro. At first light make left on Mifflin Rd.</p>",

      "description": "<p>From Goodreads:<br/>A president has been overthrown by a military coup in a nameless country in an unspecified era. The president's barber, chef, and portraitist are imprisoned, with many others, in a remote palace in the hills high above the city center. Before the coup, these three men worked with unquestioning loyalty, serving the president in seemingly benign jobs. Now, forced to serve the country's new leader, they begin to reconsider their role in the old regime.</p> <p>In simple, elegant prose \"Blood Kin\" alternates between the voices of the barber, the chef, and the portraitist. Later in the book their wives, lovers, and daughters tell their own tales. As the old order falls, so does the veil that hides the truth about these men and women's secret passions. No one, it seems, is entirely immune to the many temptations of power.</p> <p>Ceridwen Dovey's debut is a welcome addition to the important tradition of allegorical writing about political upheaval and personal guilt. Her clever, magnetic story will resonate with fans of J. M. Coetzee, Mario Vargas Llosa, and Gabriel Garcí­a Márquez.</p>",

For example: extreme weather events, a government that’s about to go flat broke, and sometimes there are catastrophes that just happen without warning. Other times, they unfold over a period of a few days. We need to be prepared for the days ahead by growing our faith. The race ahead is for those who are prepared. And preparedness is about faith. The Black Robed Regiment was the name the British placed on the courageous and patriotic clergy of the American Revolution, referencing the black robes that ministers wore in that day. Those pastors boldly proclaimed the Word of God in everything that applied to life, whether spiritual or temporal, whether related to eternal life with Christ or to topics such as taxation, education, government, military, or any other issue touched in the Bible. America is longing for a resurgence of the Black Robed Regiment – they want ministers who will provide much needed community leadership and speak out fearlessly on issues related to today's culture. Join Pastor Mark to learn more about how to be READY FOR ANYTHING.</p> <p>3:30 PM TASTE TEST DEMONSTRATION Your eating patterns and food choices play an important role in how you can be ready for anything. The nutritional value of food that we eat greatly governs our health. Subsequently, it affects most of the activities that we do in our life. Our food is the only source of energy, minerals, and vitamins for our body and is ultimately responsible for determining if you will be ready for anything. </p> <p><br/>5:00 pm Essential Oils for Emergency Preparedness<br/>with Charlene Brower, P.T. and Shane Brower, Ph.D.</p> <p>Join us for an interactive, informational presentation on the use of essential oils as a safe, natural, and effective means of addressing common healthcare concerns faced in both emergency and day-to-day situations, including injuries, colds &amp; flu, infection prevention, chronic pain, and emotional issues such as depression, stress, and anxiety. We will discuss what essential oils are, and the science behind their efficacy. You will also have the opportunity to experience the oils firsthand, and to ask questions about how you can use essential oils for your specific concerns. Come and learn about the powerful therapeutic properties of these natural, plant-based products.</p> <p>Shane and Charlene have been using herbal remedies for over a decade. Charlene is a licensed Physical Therapist, with over 14 years of experience in helping people achieve and maintain healthy lifestyles. Shane is a physics professor who studies the science of essential oils. Together, Charlene and Shane formed ōBundant Health Naturally to provide education and information on the safe, effective use of essential oils for a more natural and healthy lifestyle.</p>",

Other times, they unfold over a period of a few days. We need to be spiritually prepared for the days ahead by growing our faith. Faith comes from hearing the Word of God. The race ahead is for those who are prepared. And preparedness is about faith.</p> <p><br/>3:30 PM TASTE TEST DEMONSTRATION Your eating patterns and food choices play an important role in how you can be ready for anything. The nutritional value of food that we eat greatly governs our health. Subsequently, it affects most of the activities that we do in our life. Our food is the only source of energy, minerals, and vitamins for our body and is ultimately responsible for determining if you will be ready for anything.</p> <p>5:00 PM Shane and Charlene Brower will give a presentation on ESSENTIAL OILS for Emergency Preparedness. Learn how you can use essential oils to safely and effectively address all of your family’s healthcare concerns, including those of your pets. In addition we will learn about the use of essential oils in organic gardening and natural cleaning products</p>",

We usually play all day, break for dinner around 6:00, then it's back to gaming until everybody poops out. </p> <p>Incidentally, many of our regular players no longer bother to sign up (but I really wish they would!), so if it looks like only  one or two people are coming, there could actually be quite a few more.  Remember, I will always cancel a game Meetup if we aren't gaming that day, so you won't be sitting there all by yourself waiting for a friend.  <img src=\"http://img1.meetupstatic.com/3039620944357886359/img/smileys/confused.gif\" />  And please, remember to change your rsvp to no if you can't make it that day!</p> <p>$1.00 will be charged to help cover the fee Meetup charges and to buy games for the group.  Join us and let the games begin!!! </p>",

Whether it's a Neapolitan street song, a Sicilian tarantella, or an Italian top-40s hit, these musicians bring out all of the color and passion inherent in the music. The ensemble uses traditional Italian instruments -- mandolins, mandocello, guitar -- to create a truly authentic Italian sound. Their repertoire includes folk tunes, music from other European countries, and any other melody that catches their fancy.

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.</p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.</p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.</p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.</p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br/>  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>  Jason,</p>",

      "description": "<p>Join us on Tuesdays for American Mah Jong! Folks begin arriving around 5PM, and play begins table by table as soon as we have three or four players plus a set.  (We usually have 3-5 tables.)  By 6:15 or so, most players have arrived. We rotate among the tables... at the end of each game, East walks around to see if another table is close to the end of their game, so that two players can swap places.   At the other end of the evening... play must end by 9PM when Panera closes.  Tables begin wrapping up play any time after 8:15 or so.</p> <p><br/>If you have never played, or if you have not played for a very long time, we highly recommend that you take a Mah Jong 101 beginner class before playing with us - beginner classes are offered every few months.  Mah jong is a wonderful game, but it's hard to learn by just watching others play!</p> <p><br/>Please order your 2015 card from the National Mah Jongg League, here: <a href=\"http://www.nationalmahjonggleague.org/\"><a href=\"http://www.nationalmahjonggleague.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.nationalmahjonggleague.org/</a></a> Amazon.com also carries the cards. Note that you want the NMJL card, and no other! (There are some colorful alternatives out there.. but we play NMJL card and rules.)</p> <p>Experienced players -- please bring your cards and please bring a set if you have one.</p> <p>Please do not bring any outside food or beverages into Panera! Instead, please plan to buy *something* from Panera, even if it's just a beverage or a cookie, to support their willingness to host us.</p>",

In 1917, oil companies didn't hire women to work for them, so that alone was quite a miracle. At least it was until she arrived from eastern Arkansas with an ego the size of Texas and dreams twice as large, only to have them all shredded to pieces in ten minutes when the directors of the oil company informed her they thought she was a male with a name like Addison. She was sitting on the bench outside the drugstore waiting for her ride to take her back to Ardmore to catch the train back to Arkansas when Tilly Anderson sat down beside her. In less than an hour, Addison found herself at the Evening Star ranch setting Tucker Anderson's, Tilly's cantankerous cousin, broken leg and suturing the gash in his hand. Just as suddenly, she was offered the job of caring for him until he healed. Anything beat going back to Arkansas with her deflated ego and shattered dreams so she took on the job. Tucker had his ideas about women. They should live to serve and obey the male species and, rather than endure a lifetime with one like either of his girl cousins, Tilly and Clara, he'd be a bachelor until he reached the Pearly Gates of Heaven. Then he broke his leg and the two cousins hired a female doctor to take care of him. He figured he'd died and gone straight to hell.</p>",

Now  you can jam with other newer players at Mt. Lebanon Library the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of each month.</p> <p>These sessions are for players who have had a few lessons or know some basic chords and want to learn more while playing with others. We will experiment with basic strums, alternate chords and how to move from one chord to the next. We will play songs slowly at first and then again, only faster.</p> <p>The group will choose the songs they want to play using \"The Daily Ukulele 365 Songs for Better Living,\" by Liz and Jim Beloff. This book is available from local music stores and online.</p> <p>Bring your ukulele and a floor music stand along with the music book. If you want to play songs other than what is in this book, please notify the group the week prior so copies can be made.</p> <p>As we progress, we will open the group to more advanced players and more challenging music selections.</p> <p>If you have any questions, please contact Patty Williams at [masked].</p>",

We flow from one position to the next and focus on alignment, posture, breath, increased flexibility, strength, and balance. Class is held in the Keith Seminar Center upstairs at Dormont Library. It's private, has dimmer lights, carpet and we play music. I do the practice as I teach it. I tend to break a sweat and others do too, but it depends how much you put into it. The classes are usually 50/50 men and women. Lots of couples - couples, friends, sisters - attend. The class is donation-based. $5 donation is suggested.</p> <p>All classes are from 7:00 – 8:00 pm.</p> <p><br/>Beginners are welcome.</p> <p>$5 donation suggested.</p> <p>Loaner mats available.</p> <p>Visit: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dormontyoga\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dormontyoga\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/dormontyoga</a></a> for more info.

Do you get lost with the sheer amount of instruments playing at the same time? Have you ever felt like you need to reset your steps sharply when you finally find a familiar cue? This workshop explores the different layers in the music, their purpose and rhythmic nature, and how to utilize this knowledge to dance in harmony. This is an audio-visual experience, listening exercises in a progressive manner, as well as active coaching on how to let the music guide your movements naturally and seamlessly.</p> <p>This workshop is a two-part series. The second workshop starts Wednesday. See our calendar or the link below for more info.</p> <p><br/>Pre-Sale: $30 for both workshops at <a href=\"http://salsamusicality.eventzilla.net/web/event?eventid=2139090827\"><a href=\"http://salsamusicality.eventzilla.net/\" class=\"linkified\">http://salsamusicality.eventzilla.net/</a></a></p> <p>At-Door Both Workshops: $35</p> <p>At-Door One Workshop: $20</p> <p>VIP Salsa Night: $3 (paid at door only).</p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/2/e/600_440254606.jpeg\" /></p>",

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.</p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.</p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.</p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.</p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p> <p>6.

Even opting for kiddie scoops (and even if you don't get ice cream in each place) that's  <i>a lot</i> of ice cream. While I'm planning on indulging in the real stuff, most of these places should have sugar-free and lactose-free (ice/sorbet) options. And of course, you don't have to indulge at every stop (though you'll get high fives all around and admiration if you go for the gold)!</p> <p>Ok, so initially I wasn't planning to cross-post this MiPGH event to the coffee group since it's ice cream and not coffee, but then I figured there are plenty of opportunities for coffee and tea (and coffee ice cream!) on the way. This event is also posted at meetin.org.</p>",

There will be an exploration of mechanics that will also help you send and receive clearer signals in both leading and following roles, as well as dancing in a more “economic” style. The result? You’ll feel like a feather to your dance partners (less chance of injury) and will conserve lots of energy to let you enjoy those socials all night long!</p> <p>Additional $3 at the door: WEDNESDAY NIGHT SOCIAL! Stick around until 2am for VIP Salsa Nights held every Wednesday and Saturday at Los Sabrosos! Luis will be hanging out with us to dance and practice what we've learned over the 2 days of workshops!</p> <p>Pricing:</p> <p>Pre-Sale: $30 for both workshops at</p> <p><a href=\"http://salsamusicality.eventzilla.net/\"><a href=\"http://salsamusicality.eventzilla.net/\" class=\"linkified\">http://salsamusicality.eventzilla.net/</a></a></p> <p>At-Door Both Workshops: $35</p> <p>At-Door One Workshop: $20</p> <p>VIP Salsa Night: $3 (paid at door only).</p>",

Following the journey of the coming-of-age Catherine Morland and her misadventures in Bath to the \"horrid\" Abbey, Jane Austen presents us with perhaps her funniest sociological book, that proves not only that teens will be teens in any age, but that an overactive imagination is not always a blessing, and that love is often the result of being loved. Readers should keep on the lookout for the commentaries on novels, feminine wiles and homecomings from Austen herself - a technique subdued in her other novels.</p>",

We will explore ways release that energy and have it fully available to us at all times. We will discuss ways to expand into our fuller potential so that we aren’t living in limited and defined experiences.</p> <p>We will do a really fun and enlightening exercise called the “exploration of awareness.” This exercise will clear our awareness and our view because we cannot put our view on anything else effectively if we’ve got a dirty windshield. Most of us are living our life through a dirty windshield. This exercise will clean our windshield and allow us to look at life more clearly and stimulate our imagination.</p> <p>Look forward to seeing you at our next meet up.</p> <p>Love and Blessings,</p> <p>Joe</p>",

We flow from one position to the next and focus on alignment, posture, breath, increased flexibility, strength, and balance. Class is held in the Keith Seminar Center upstairs at Dormont Library. It's private, has dimmer lights, carpet and we play music. I do the practice as I teach it. I tend to break a sweat and others do too, but it depends how much you put into it. The classes are usually 50/50 men and women. Lots of couples - couples, friends, sisters - attend. The class is donation-based. $5 donation is suggested.</p> <p>All classes are from 7:00 – 8:00 pm.</p> <p><br/>Beginners are welcome.</p> <p>$5 donation suggested.</p> <p>Loaner mats available.</p> <p>Visit: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dormontyoga\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dormontyoga\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/dormontyoga</a></a> for more info.

So it's the perfect setting for the gripping drama <b><i>Sharon's Grave</i></b>. Written by John B. Keane, who is one of Ireland's greatest playwrights, <b><i>Sharon's Grave</i></b> is a tale of ordinary people in extraordinary situations (and settings). As her father takes to his death bed, Trassie must fight for her inheritance and protect her simple-minded brother against the machinations of a scheming cousin. Into this family feud, Keane weaves the mythical story of a beautiful Celtic princess. The result is at once grounded and grand, romantic and realist -- theater of the highest order. Aoife Spillane-Hinks directs a stunning new production with a fantastic cast and set.</p> <p>Check out these great articles and reviews about the show <a href=\"http://triblive.com/aande/theaterarts/8661461-74/sharon-grave-keane#axzz3fzldNuLE\"><a href=\"http://triblive.com/aande/theaterarts/8661461-74/sharon-grave-keane#axzz3fzldNuLE\" class=\"linkified\">http://triblive.com/aande/theaterarts/8661461-74/sharon-grave-keane#axzz3fzldNuLE</a></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2015/07/16/Preview-A-family-tempest-looms-in-Sharon-s-Grave/stories/201507160105\"><a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2015/07/16/Preview-A-family-tempest-looms-in-Sharon-s-Grave/stories/201507160105\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2015/07/16/Preview-A-family-tempest-looms-in-Sharon-s-Grave/stories/201507160105</a></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://triblive.com/aande/theaterarts/8661494-74/sharon-pict-theater#axzz3gUTWiClg\"><a href=\"http://triblive.com/aande/theaterarts/8661494-74/sharon-pict-theater#axzz3gUTWiClg\" class=\"linkified\">http://triblive.com/aande/theaterarts/8661494-74/sharon-pict-theater#axzz3gUTWiClg</a></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/sharons-grave-at-pict-classic/Content?oid=1841836\"><a href=\"http://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/sharons-grave-at-pict-classic/Content?oid=1841836\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/sharons-grave-at-pict-classic/Content?oid=1841836</a></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2015/07/21/Stage-review-Battle-of-good-vs-evil-plays-out-in-family-feud-within-Sharon-s-Grave/stories/201507210024\"><a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2015/07/21/Stage-review-Battle-of-good-vs-evil-plays-out-in-family-feud-within-Sharon-s-Grave/stories/201507210024\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2015/07/21/Stage-review-Battle-of-good-vs-evil-plays-out-in-family-feud-within-Sharon-s-Grave/stories/201507210024</a></a></p> <p>For more information about PICT Classic Theatre and this production, please visit <a href=\"http://www.picttheatre.org/play/sharons-grave/\"><a href=\"http://www.picttheatre.org/play/sharons-grave/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.picttheatre.org/play/sharons-grave/</a></a></p> <p>Also, if anyone might be interested, there will also be a very special Full Irish Breakfast at Claddagh Irish Pub with director Aoife Spillane-Hinks &amp; PICT Artistic Director Alan Stanford on Saturday June 27 to discuss \"Sharon's Grave\" and celtic folklore in general.

FYI, here is a listing of about 20 upcoming shows the Pittsburgh region where Goldstar has access to 50% discount tickets<a href=\"http://www.goldstar.com/pittsburgh/events/?page=3&amp;mode=infinite\"> <a href=\"http://www.goldstar.com/pittsburgh/events/?page=3&amp;mode=infinite\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.goldstar.com/pittsburgh/events/?page=3&amp;mode=infinite</a> </a>In addition, Goldstar operates in many other cities. While Goldstar is certainly not a substitute for more traditional savings and benefits through the usual subscriptions or other discount offers (including what we can sometimes arrange for ourselves via Meetup), it is a relatively new option for Pittsburgh.

Keane<i><br/></i></b></p> <p>Trouble is brewing as Donal Conlee takes to his deathbed. His lonely daughter must fight for her land and protect her brother against the scheming of their malignant cousin. This story of land-lust, mystery and folklore is a classic tale, set against the rugged North Atlantic coastline of Ireland in the 1920s. Witness the mastery of one of Ireland’s foremost storytellers and playwrights as he weaves the tale of this Conlee family feud together with the mythical story of a beautiful Celtic princess, Sharon, who meets an untimely end. Similar to the plays of John Millington Synge or Martin McDonagh, this is a show for all the family to enjoy.</p> <p>For more information about playwright John B. Keane, please visit <a href=\"http://johnbkeane.ie/\"><a href=\"http://johnbkeane.ie/\" class=\"linkified\">http://johnbkeane.ie/</a></a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Keane\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Keane\" class=\"linkified\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Keane</a></a></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/8/3/600_438566755.jpeg\" /></p> <p><br/><b>Performance Schedule</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/8/9/600_438566761.jpeg\" /></p>",

She has the meanest mother in the South, possibly the world, and on top of that, she’s pretty sure she’s ugly. Just when she’s resigned herself to her fate, she sees a movie that will change her life—Sixteen Candles. But in her case, life doesn’t imitate art. Tormented endlessly in school with the nickname \"Monkey Night,\" and hopelessly in unrequited love with a handsome football player, James Farrell, Davie finds that it is bittersweet to dream of Molly Ringwald endings. When a cruel school prank goes too far, Davie leaves the life she knows and reinvents herself in the glittery world of Hollywood—as a beautiful and successful lounge singer in a swanky nightclub.</p> <p>Davie is finally a million miles from where she started—until she bumps into her former obsession, James Farrell. To Davie’s astonishment, James doesn’t recognize her, and she can’t bring herself to end the fantasy. She lets him fall as deeply in love with her as she once was with him. But is life ever that simple? Just as they’re about to ride off into the sunset, the past comes back with a vengeance, threatening to crush Davie’s dreams—and break her heart again.</p> <p>With wholly original characters and a cinematic storyline, 32 Candlesintroduces Ernessa T. Carter, a new voice in fiction with smarts, attitude, and sassiness to spare. </p>",

As a black professional, I feel it is important we learn how to effectively come together as a community to leverage our resources and glean from the knowledge of others.  If you are interested or know anyone interested in investment and its role in wealth creation, consider attending the organizational meeting scheduled Saturday April 4th at the Triplex (7238 Fleury Way). We will begin at 9:07 A.M. This is a chance to learn about investing and is NOT \"get rich quick\". This is for those new to investing or mature investors. The group will benefit from all types. Group expectations and desires will also be clarified during the meeting.</p>",

All ages.</p> <p>Ellen Kushner began her career in publishing as a fiction editor in New York City, but left to write her first novel, Swordspoint, which has become a cult classic, hailed as the progenitor of the “mannerpunk” (or “Fantasy of Manners”) school of urban fantasy. Swordspoint was followed by Thomas the Rhymer (World Fantasy Award and the Mythopoeic Award), and two more novels in her “Riverside” series. Her short fiction appears regularly in various anthologies. Ellen Kushner’s fiction has been translated into numerous languages, including Japanese, French, Dutch, German, Spanish, Latvian and Finnish. She has narrated and co-produced “illuminated” versions of all three of the “Riverside” novels with SueMedia Productions for Neil Gaiman Presents at Audible.com–and won a 2013 Audie Award for Swordspoint.

The sequel, The Magic Mirror of the Mermaid Queen, followed in 2009. The Freedom Maze, a time-travel fantasy set in Louisiana, was awarded the Norton Award, the Prometheus Award, and the Mythopoeic Award.

current we may finish much sooner.</p> <p>I recommend bringing something to drink or a snack, and an extra layer if it is going to be cold.</p> <p>bilge pumps, paddle floats and other<br/>safety equipment to get back in you boat are good to bring if you have<br/>them.  I don't plan to tip, but it has happened unexpectedly and I was<br/>glad to have my pump.  It is also good to have a cell phone in a dry bag,<br/>ziplock or other water proof container just in case.  In the event of rain<br/>(not storms) this trip will still go- but you may want a spray skirt to keep<br/>your boat dry.  A camera is nice but we may not get too many pictures in the dark- we can try.  (I don't think we'll be in water that is very deep so it should be possible to push your boat to shore standing or get back in on the water if you tip)</p> <p>This trip will run unless there is<br/>lightening or thunder at launch time (or storms are predicted on the radar) to<br/>arrive during the time we will be on the water.  A low chance of storms<br/>may mean shortening the trip- or turning around if we hear thunder when on the<br/>water.  If the weather is questionable please call me at[masked] to<br/>see whether the trip is still on.  If the river is at flood stage or<br/>obviously unsafe due to recent torrential rains- this trip will be<br/>cancelled or changed to the Allegheny River at Freeport.  I will not be able to see the conditions until I arrive around 5:30PM, but if you have doubts- please call, otherwise a decision will have to be made based on what we see upon arrival.</p> <p>Directions from Pittsburgh</p> <p>Take Route 28 North 23.4 miles to exit<br/>16</p> <p>Turn Right on Bakerstown Road and go 0.6 miles</p> <p>Left on Freeport Road and go 0.7 <br/>miles</p> <p>Merge onto PA 356 North (0.5 miles)</p> <p>Turn Left on PA 356 South and go 5.4 miles</p> <p>Turn left to stay on PA 356/ 56 (Leechburg Road) for another 3.5 miles</p> <p>Turn left on Orr Ave. (1.5 miles)- Cross the Kiskiminetas River</p> <p>Once on the East side of the Kiski.

We usually play all day, break for dinner around 6:00, then it's back to gaming until everybody poops out. </p> <p>Incidentally, many of our regular players no longer bother to sign up (but I really wish they would!), so if it looks like only  one or two people are coming, there could actually be quite a few more.  Remember, I will always cancel a game Meetup if we aren't gaming that day, so you won't be sitting there all by yourself waiting for a friend.  <img src=\"http://img1.meetupstatic.com/3039620944357886359/img/smileys/confused.gif\" />  And please, remember to change your rsvp to no if you can't make it that day!</p> <p>$1.00 will be charged to help cover the fee Meetup charges and to buy games for the group.  Join us and let the games begin!!! </p>",

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.</p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.</p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.</p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.</p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p> <p>6.

It's Really Fun!</p> <p>Music is usually selected from \"The Daily Ukulele... 365 Songs for Better Living,\" by Liz and Jim Beloff. This book is readily available at music stores, book stores, and Amazon.com.  Sometimes members bring other music to play (bring 15 copies to share). We play seated at a large conference table. Bring a table-top music stand if you have one.</p> <p>Snacks and libations to share are welcome.</p> <p>For more information, contact Sandy at <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]</a></p> <p>Directions to the Church: Take I279 North to Wexford exit.

      "description": "<p><b>How does a PittsburghTennisLeague Season / League run?</b></p> <p>The league advertises the season dates and builds a queue of committed players for the season.</p> <p><b>Doubles Partner Matching Service</b></p> <p>  For the players who don't have a teammate for the season we have a Doubles Partner Matching Service. All the players who sign up for the service will be connected with a teammate that is most suitable to your request and playing region. If we don't have a suitable partner for you than we'll hope within the first week of the season one will sign up or we'll refund your payment.</p> <p><br/><b>Kickoff Day - Aug. 4th</b></p> <p>The start day of the season, players are sent a kickoff email that contains important information about the league, the link where your league standings and players contact information. We guarantee 6 playing partners at your playing level, but have been averaging closer to 15+ partners in most cities.</p> <p><br/><b>Your Task - \"Flexible Scheduling\"</b></p> <p>After this kickoff email is sent, it is the player's task to communicate with other players. Players should work with their partners to find an agreeable time and location to play the match. While PittsburghTennisLeague doesn't mandate your playing schedule, it is recommended that players schedule at least one match per week. By request of the players, we started to allow players to play 1 rematch per season. The regular season is all about playing as much as you can. As of Jan. 1st, 2013 we've had 189 players play more than 20 matches in a season.</p> <p><br/><b>Where to Play?</b></p> <p>Play at your local free tennis courts, tennis parks, condo courts or tennis clubs. The league strongly suggests that players jointly try to pick a tennis court location convenient to both. We provide an extensive list of tennis courts, including # of courts, lighting, hitting walls, etc. We strive to keep this list up-to-date</p> <p>PittsburghTennisLeague sets up a must play dates to push players out on the courts. The final deadline is the date marking the end of the season, at which point players with 5 wins will qualify for a post-season playoff to determine the league champion.</p> <p><br/><b>How to Play?</b></p> <p>Players can use three semi-standard playing formats: 2 out of 3 sets, 2 sets with 10 point super tie-breaker or the 10-game pro set (First to 10, used when court time is limited).</p> <p><br/><b>Playoffs</b><br/>Each season concludes with a playoffs where players with anywhere from 3 to 5 season wins qualifies for a single elimination tourney. The champion is awarded based upon the league Prize Pool. Each singles league champion also receives a playing entry into the National Tourney which is already scheduled for Crandon Park Tennis Center in Key Biscayne - Nov. 13-15, 2015.</p> <p><br/><b>Join Today!!</b></p> <p>Full price is $29.95 for team entry, $19.95 for the partner matching service, BUT the earlier you sign up we typically offer discounts during these tougher economic times. Just go to the <a href=\"http://pittsburghtennisleague.com/join\">Join Page</a> and complete the short form. We'd be happy to find you dedicated tennis playing partners.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Join us on Tuesdays for American Mah Jong! Folks begin arriving around 5PM, and play begins table by table as soon as we have three or four players plus a set.  (We usually have 3-5 tables.)  By 6:15 or so, most players have arrived. We rotate among the tables... at the end of each game, East walks around to see if another table is close to the end of their game, so that two players can swap places.   At the other end of the evening... play must end by 9PM when Panera closes.  Tables begin wrapping up play any time after 8:15 or so.</p> <p><br/>If you have never played, or if you have not played for a very long time, we highly recommend that you take a Mah Jong 101 beginner class before playing with us - beginner classes are offered every few months.  Mah jong is a wonderful game, but it's hard to learn by just watching others play!</p> <p><br/>Please order your 2015 card from the National Mah Jongg League, here: <a href=\"http://www.nationalmahjonggleague.org/\"><a href=\"http://www.nationalmahjonggleague.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.nationalmahjonggleague.org/</a></a> Amazon.com also carries the cards. Note that you want the NMJL card, and no other! (There are some colorful alternatives out there.. but we play NMJL card and rules.)</p> <p>Experienced players -- please bring your cards and please bring a set if you have one.</p> <p>Please do not bring any outside food or beverages into Panera! Instead, please plan to buy *something* from Panera, even if it's just a beverage or a cookie, to support their willingness to host us.</p>",

By doing this, the people will move our courts back to “Courts of Justice” and take back 100% control of their government.</p> <p><b>THE DUTY OF THE COMMON LAW GRAND JURY is to right any wrong. </b>If anyone’s unalienable rights have been violated, or removed, without a legal sentence of their peers the grand jury can restore them. And if a dispute shall arise concerning this matter it shall be settled according to the judgment of the grand jurors, the sureties of the peace.</p> <p><b>IN A US SUPREME COURT STUNNING 6 TO 3 DECISION JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA,</b> writing for the majority, confirmed that the American grand jury is neither part of the judicial, executive nor legislative branches of government, but instead belongs to the people. It is in effect a fourth branch of government \"governed\" and administered to directly by and on behalf of the American people, and its authority emanates from the Bill of Rights and <b>has the power to enforce law and remove people from office.</b></p> <p><b>GRAND JURY BACKGROUND</b></p> <p>When the American colonies separated from England, King George retaliated by revoking the charters. Technically, the colonies were without any legal authority to operate. However, civics (the branch of political philosophy concerned with individual rights) was generally taught and known by the people who asserted their rights and maintained order by applying the common law. The people united in the form of common law grand juries and continued the functioning of government.</p> <p>As the legislatures matured they slowly increased governmental power while simultaneously reducing personal sovereign power. This was done through a combination of passing pro-government legislation and reducing or eliminating education about civics. Today, two and a quarter centuries later, hardly anyone even knows the meaning of the word, \"civics.\"</p> <p>Despite the fact that the state and federal constitutions still acknowledge the common law as the ultimate law system, people everywhere are conditioned to believe that the statutory law and codes are the only source of law. The only remaining common law term generally known among the public is \"common law marriage.\"</p> <p>The common law grand jury is now dormant only because of the public ignorance of its powers that supersede all other government entities, including the modern statutorily defined grand jury.</p> <p><b>WHAT TO DO NEXT:</b></p> <p><b>Click </b><a href=\"http://www.nationallibertyalliance.org/\"><b>www.NationalLibertyAlliance.org</b></a><b>, read the home page and view the video \"The Power of the Grand Jury\" on that page.

We'll meet at Coffee Tree Roasters in Shadyside to chat, drink coffee, and listen to music. Bring your favorite music on your phone or thumb drive to share -- you can even bring an instrument to play if you'd like. And you can just come for the coffee and company – you absolutely aren't required to bring music (I will bring my laptop to look things up on YouTube as well).</p> <p>Bring any music -- if you have music of your own creation, if you're passionate about a particular musician or band, or if you just like something and feel like sharing. It could be a recent find or something that influenced your childhood and got you though your teenage years. It could be something you love or it could even be something you hate -- just tell us why. Music is as much a story as anything -- it could be a story of you, or the story of the artist who created the music, or the story could be embedded in the song itself waiting for us to listen. Feel free to bring a story to share along with the music -- or not, if you prefer.</p> <p>We're totally open to any kind of music so, please, bring anything you'd like to share be it classical, ethnic, heavy metal, or whatever -- even classical ethnic heavy metal (I bet it exists). We'll be meeting at Coffee Tree Roasters from 7pm (to probably 9pm though the room's booked until 10pm).</p> <p>This event is also posted on <a href=\"http://www.meetin.org\">meetin.org</a>.</p>",

      "description": "<p><b>ONLY THE PEOPLE CAN SAVE AMERICA - WILL YOU?</b></p> <p>We are establishing administrations for common law grand juries in all 3144 counties in the United States of America. By doing this, the people will move our courts back to “Courts of Justice” and take back 100% control of their government.</p> <p><b>THE DUTY OF THE </b><b>COMMON LAW GRAND JURY</b> <b>is to right any wrong.</b> If anyone’s unalienable rights have been violated, or removed, without a legal sentence of their peers the grand jury can restore them. And if a dispute shall arise concerning this matter it shall be settled according to the judgment of the grand jurors, the sureties of the peace.</p> <p><b>IN A US SUPREME COURT STUNNING 6 TO 3 DECISION JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA</b>, writing for the majority, confirmed that the American grand jury is neither part of the judicial, executive nor legislative branches of government, but instead belongs to the people. It is in effect a fourth branch of government \"governed\" and administered to directly by and on behalf of the American people, and its authority emanates from the Bill of Rights and <b>has the power to enforce law and remove people from office</b>.</p> <p><b>GRAND JURY BACKGROUND</b></p> <p>When the American colonies separated from England, King George retaliated by revoking the charters. Technically, the colonies were without any legal authority to operate. However, civics (the branch of political philosophy concerned with individual rights) was generally taught and known by the people who asserted their rights and maintained order by applying the common law. The people united in the form of common law grand juries and continued the functioning of government.</p> <p>As the legislatures matured they slowly increased governmental power while simultaneously reducing personal sovereign power. This was done through a combination of passing pro-government legislation and reducing or eliminating education about civics. Today, two and a quarter centuries later, hardly anyone even knows the meaning of the word, \"civics.\"</p> <p>Despite the fact that the state and federal constitutions still acknowledge the common law as the ultimate law system, people everywhere are conditioned to believe that the statutory law and codes are the only source of law. The only remaining common law term generally known among the public is \"common law marriage.\"</p> <p>The common law grand jury is now dormant only because of the public ignorance of its powers that supersede all other government entities, including the modern statutorily defined grand jury.</p> <p><b>WHAT TO DO NEXT:</b></p> <p><b>Click</b> <a href=\"http://www.nationallibertyalliance.org/\"><b>www.NationalLibertyAlliance.org</b></a><b>, read the home page and view the video \"The Power of the Grand Jury\" on that page. Read the Preface and the Mission Statement under the \"Welcome\" tab in the navigation bar above. Then, to join our endeavor, click \"Register\" at the top right side of the page. After you log in, click on the \"Jurist\" tab that will appear on the navigation bar, and you will see step by step instructions on what to do next.

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.</p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.</p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.</p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.</p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br/>  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>  Jason,</p>",

So much for that. But the spirit of Fight Club remains, the idea of trying to bring out the best in each other through the evolution of consciousness. As Brad Pitt said about the movie, \"Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it.\" And not fear the pain! In this meetup we discuss ways that concepts introduced during the Incito Veritas series can be applied to our daily lives. We will learn and grow as we process our experiences. Bottom line: Knowing and Not Doing is Not Knowing, or as it says in James 2:26, \"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead.\"</p>",

Since receiving it I have heard it mentioned by at least 5 other people, with a few of them being avid players. Since the game is only a 2 vs 2 game and the sets being very expensive ($60 each) I'm going to make this a \"Lawn Game\" Meetup so we can have a bunch of different activities going on at once.</p> <p>We can do Kan Jam, cornhole and Spikeball...and if we have enough space we can try Blitzball, which I should be getting in the mail this week. We're going to run this Meetup at the Oval in Schenley Park because we're not going to need a ton of space, but we'll definitely need flat ground for all of our events. Look for us at the top of the stairs near the tennis courts. Each game we have needs 4 players to play them so don't hesitate to bring some friends!</p>",

      "description": "<p>Leader: Renee</p> <p>\"Those Old Fashioned Camp Songs\"--Remember camp?  Scouts, church, adventure, tenting? Tonight we will bring back some of those old songs we used to sing around the evening campfire to rekindle memories and just have a good time. Most of the songs on the Adobe list consist of less than five easy chords, so the emphasis is not on learning fancy fingering, but on just singing with one another.  Some of the songs are downright silly, so come and have some fun with us!</p> <p>Come at 6:45 pm to tune-up and talk. We play from 7 to 9 pm, starting with the playlist below, followed by requests. No experience required! All levels are welcome, from beginners to professionals. If you don't know the chords... just sing louder. Here is a photo of Biddle's Deck.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/f/0/600_437897392.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Biddle's invites Food Trucks every Wednesday. The food is always GREAT. But come early if you want to order food from the truck - the lines are always long and slow (but well worth the wait). <a href=\"http://www.biddlesescape.com/foodtruck/\">Here is a link to the schedule</a>. Please try to order your drinks from Biddle's - they treat Steel City Ukuleles quite well.</p> <p>1st and 3rd Wednesday evenings of each month. Winter locale is Wilkins School Community Center, 7604 Charleston Ave., Regent Square, PA 15218. Summer locale is Biddle's Escape, 401 Biddle Ave., Regent Square, PA 15221. </p> <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p><b>PLAYLIST:</b></p> <p><b>From Renee:</b></p> <p> The following songs are in a <a href=\"http://files.meetup.com/6060022/Playlist%20for%20Aug%205%202015.pdf\">PDF HERE</a>: There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly; John Jacob Jingleheimerschmidt; I'm Being Eaten By A Boa Constrictor; Found a Peanut; She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain; On Top of Spaghetti; Boom Boom, Ain't It Great To Be Crazy; She Waded in the Water; The Limerick Song; What Did Delaware?; John Brown's Baby.  See the PDF for some links to YouTube Versions.</p> <p><b>From 365 (Yellow):</b></p> <p>Carolina in the Morning, P 52</p> <p>Do Lord, P 65</p> <p>Down in the Valley, P 69</p> <p>He's Got the Whole World, P 107</p> <p>Home on the Range, P 110</p> <p>If I Had a Hammer, P 119</p> <p>I'll Fly Away, P 124</p> <p>Jada, P 138</p> <p>Kumbaya, P 142</p> <p>The Bear Went Over the Mountain, P 314</p> <p>I've Been Working on the Railroad, P 134</p> <p>Blowin' In The Wind, P 36</p> <p><b>WHAT YOU NEED:</b></p> <p>Uke, a tuner, a music stand</p> <p>The Daily Ukulele book by the Beloffs.

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.</p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.</p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.</p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.</p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br/>  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>  Jason,</p>",

      "description": "<p>The Aug. 6 Biophilia: Pittsburgh meeting will feature <b>Robert S. Mulvihill</b>, the National Aviary’s ornithologist, who will introduce the discussion topic, \"<b>Getting Up Close and Scientific with Pittsburgh's Birds</b>.\" Perhaps more than any other natural history subjects, birds help connect people with nature, and ornithology has a long history of contribution by citizen scientists. In 2013, Mulvihill brought the Smithsonian Institution's Neighborhood Nestwatch project to Pittsburgh. He and his crew study the impacts of urbanization on a selection of common songbird species — northern cardinal, American robin, song sparrow, black-capped or Carolina chickadee, gray catbird, northern mockingbird, Carolina wren, and house wren — through annual summer visits to nearly 150 backyards in the Greater Pittsburgh area, including the backyard bird habitat of Phipps' executive director, Richard V. Piacentini. Mulvihill will talk about this and the National Aviary's other research and conservation projects.</p> <p>Robert S. Mulvihill is a native Pittsburgher who has been an active member of the birding and bird conservation community for more than thirty years. He received a B.S. in Education from the University of Pittsburgh and an M.S. in Biology from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Mulvihill began his ornithological career at Powdermill Nature Reserve, the biological field station of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, where he served as a field ornithologist at the world renowned Powdermill bird banding station. He served as a regional coordinator and species account author for the first Atlas of Breeding Birds in Pennsylvania (1983 – 1989), and recently was the statewide coordinator and co-editor of the Second Atlas of Breeding Birds in Pennsylvania. Learn more about his work at <a href=\"http://www.aviary.org\">aviary.org</a>.</p> <p><b>Meeting Schedule:</b><br/>5:30 – 6 p.m. Networking and refreshments<br/>6 – 6:30 p.m. Presentation<br/>6:30 – 7:30 p.m. Discussion</p> <p><b>Directions and Parking: </b><br/>This meeting will take place in the Center for Sustainable Landscapes (CSL) Classroom which is located on the facility’s first floor. The main Conservatory entrance will be closed, as this meeting takes place after normal hours; to access the CSL, follow Frew Street (located between the Oakland/Schenley Park bridge and the Christopher Columbus statue), which will take you around the Conservatory to the lower campus. Guest parking spaces are available on your left as you approach the CSL.</p>",

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.</p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.</p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.</p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.</p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br/>  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>  Nima</p>",

Often these are based from what we see others around us doing, and we assume that the same aspirations should be ours as well. </p> <p><b>In this meeting we will discuss:</b></p> <p><i>1. How do you define success?</i></p> <p><i>2. What are your values?</i></p> <p><i>3. How do you want to feel when you achieve a goal?</i></p> <p>\n\n\nAs usual, this meeting with both be interesting and informative for all!  </p> <p>Mark your calendar for Friday, August 7th at 9:30 am. :-)</p> <p>**We are meeting in the private room at Panera in Robinson. (the one near Walmart).</p> <p>**Please contribute $3 for the expenses of the Meetup group.</p> <p>We would love to have you join us! Just a reminder that this group is different from other women's groups that are primarily geared towards networking. Thank you for respecting the purpose of this specific group.</p> <p>THIS GROUP IS NOT: <br/>* A place to pitch a product or service. <br/>* A place for you to network for customers or signups for other business groups or for your services.</p> <p>THIS GROUP IS: <br/>* A safe space to share the specific challenges that we face as entrepreneurs. <br/>* The make new friends who are like-minded. <br/>* To encourage and inspire one another.</p>",

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.</p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.</p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.</p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.</p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br/>  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>  Jason,</p>",

Rosemary has loved the painfully shy Anthony from afar (or next store) and is determined to one day marry him. How will romance bloom when a simmering battle over a sliver of land erupts between the families ad Anthony's father threatens to disinherit him? This charming quirky romantic comedy has been called \"a valentine to the wonder and weirdness of love.\"</p> <p>$20 for tickets. Call or go online ahead to purchase your ticket. Play begins at 8 PM so arrive earlier.</p>",
