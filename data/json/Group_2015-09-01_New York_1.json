We believe that self-advocacy is essential to this process and that there must be meaningful involvement of Autistic individuals in making policy at all levels: Nothing About Us Without Us.\u00a0<span>We also work with parents and other allies who share our goals. In the interest of ensuring for everyone the rights of communication and self-determination, ASAN works to change public perceptions of autism and to dispel old myths and stereotypes that have led to discrimination and abuse.<\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span>Our activities include public policy advocacy, the development of Autistic cultural activities, and leadership\u00a0training\u00a0for Autistic self-advocates.

Meet, share and fellowship with like-minded people! You will also experience techniques that will help you develop and trust your intuition, healing abilities, see auras &amp; more! This is not a discussion group, but an organized, step by step process for spiritual discovery. There is nothing EXTRA about Extra-Sensory-Percep tion. Everyone is psychic! The more you develop your intuition, the easier it will be for you to connect with your Angels. This is because your angels communicate with you through your psychic sensitivity. Connect with your Angels for help in all areas of your life; from finding a parking space, to helping you with career moves and finding or improving relationships.

All new members must attend a \"Meet and Greet\" or be vouched for by an existing group member before we allow access to our website and calendar. In this day and age of internet predators, we feel this step is important for the safety of our children. We're sure you understand. If you found us through an existing member of the group, please have her contact Stacey or Rebecca to vouch for you. You will then be allowed to join without the need to attend a \u201cMeet and Greet\u201d event.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Our current dues are $20 and renew annually every September. We use our dues to pay Meetup.com website fees and to hold two family parties a year-- one near Valentine\u2019s Day, our \"Sweetheart Soiree\", and our annual \u201cSummer Bash!\u201d Dues can be paid to your host at the \u201cMeet &amp; Greet\u201d or within 7 days by PayPal. Dues will be prorated for new members based on the month they join our group.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n We hope you decide to be a part of our group but if you change your mind anytime within the first 30 days after joining, you will receive a full refund of the dues.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n <strong><img src=\"http:\/\/img1.meetupstatic.com\/img\/smileys\/smile.gif\" alt=\"smile\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px\"><\/strong>Attendance Policy<img src=\"http:\/\/img1.meetupstatic.com\/img\/smileys\/smile.gif\" alt=\"smile\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n Member participation is vital to our group and we encourage all members to attend and host meetups. All members must attend at least one meetup every two months to maintain membership. Members who do not consistently attend meetups may be removed from the group at the discretion of the organizers.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n When attending meetups, please RSVP in a timely manner so that the host knows who will attend. Treat these RSVPs as if you were meeting your best friend, call the host if you will be late or cannot make it.

This may sound like a lot, but we have great instructors, and the enjoyment and camaraderie make it worthwhile. I just found without the professional leadership the group would get stale very quickly. If you can sing in tune, you are a welcome member. We learn new songs each meeting, so the material is always fresh. Even if you think this is not your style of music, it's a whole different experience in person when you're singing it, not just listening to it. Come on out, we have a blast. Also, we have met monthly since June 2008, and there is usually at least 20 people in attendance. Not everyone who comes signs up thru Meetup.

In the Fall we enjoy the beautiful scenery with winery trips, fall foliage hikes, Halloween fun, and much more. We amp it up and embrace Winter\u00a0<span>where we will have a variety of events planned including: Ski + Snowboard Trips, Cross Country Skiing, Ice Skating, Snow Tubing, Ice Climbing, sledding, snowmobiling, and so much more local indoor\/outdoor events.

This group is for people of all skill levels and of all biking types (recreational, endurance, leisure, mountain, road, etc.). We meet regularly for in Stamford, Greenwich, and Rowayton, Norwalk, but also plan meetups in other areas, for rail trail, road, and off-road rides.<\/p>\n<p><span>If you are a beginner, this is the place to start. You will meet others who can give you advice before you buy any gear. If you are an experienced cyclist, this group is an ideal way to meet other bikers to talk about gear, local routes, and to plan trips. Cyclist of all levels are welcome!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>SBMG is a social network forum, not a club, training\u00a0facility, or\u00a0outfitter. All events are\u00a0common adventures, are<\/span> <strong>non-autocratic<\/strong> <span>in nature, and not for profit (unless hosted specifically by a\u00a0business, institution, or outfitter following a different liability model). SBMG, its organizers, and its members assume no legal and or civil responsibility for or to any individual or event.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>We Encourage Safe Cycling<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>We suggest for safety reasons that everyone ride with a helmet, in a legal manor, and in a cycle-pods of three to five.\u00a0The forum makes it possible for novice, intermediate, and advanced bikers to find each other and form safe ride pods.\u00a0Road cyclists should follow rules of the road.\u00a0 Off road bikers should follow rules of the park.\u00a0 The social nature of the group allows members to\u00a0share\u00a0safety tips and skills in a non-structured friendly format. \u00a0Safety is your responsibility!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>How We Set Up Events<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span><span>The Stamford Bicycling Meetup<\/span> Group (SBMG) \u00a0is not a leader-dictated Meetup group, but a member-driven forum.\u00a0Bicycle enthusiasts are welcome to join the forum and suggest locations for common-adventure rides.\u00a0 All members can suggest a place, date, and time for a bike-ride event.\u00a0 In fact, SBMG relies heavily on individual members to put events on the calendar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>When two other members decide to attend the suggestion moves to the calendar and is announced to the group as an event. \u00a0(Some events are moved to the calendar by one of<\/span><span>the<\/span><span>SBMG moderators<\/span><span>with less than three people on the RSVP list.)<\/span> <span>Once it is on the calendar it is no longer a suggestion, but an event and it gets announced to the group by e-mail. \u00a0Whenever you visit the SBMG page,<\/span><span>you should check the SUGGESTED events page to see if there is a suggested event that you might want to attend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Many people worry that if they suggest a ride too many bikers will show up and they would be\u00a0responsible\u00a0for a large group. \u00a0Most of the SBMG events attract about 1% of the members, which is about 2 to 4 bikers.\u00a0That is just the right size for a group ride.\u00a0Members just need to be specific on the day, time, and place (as well as bike-ride type, skill level, pace, etc.) when making a suggestion. \u00a0The events are common adventures, so you are not\u00a0responsible\u00a0for others, just yourself, but there is always safety in numbers. \u00a0However, you should be very specific about the\u00a0bike-ride type, skill level, and pace of your suggested ride. \u00a0It is not a good idea for bikers of a single pod<\/span><span>to have<\/span><span>a mixed expectation of the ride... it just leads to\u00a0disappointment\u00a0and a ride pod break down. \u00a0In short, be clear in your suggestion\u00a0description\u00a0and others with like-minded<\/span><span>thinking will join you (i.e. clearly state road ride, mountain bike ride, novice, intermediate, advance, short, long, fast pace, leisure pace, free-ride, trail-ride, etc.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>SBMG wants all its members to feel free to make ride event suggestions.\u00a0Such suggestions can be novice leisure rides in a park or rail-trail (with picnic and frequent stops), intermediate-level day road rides, or advanced-skill mountain bike rides. Anyone can take the initiative to add bike-ride events to the calendar.\u00a0And, this is the best way to get events that work for your personal schedule and skill level so you never have to ride alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Ideas for Meetups<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>We are interested in finding racers and triathlon riders that want to do a more rigorous training ride.\u00a0 If you are interested in training with others then please suggest a date, time, and place for likeminded cyclists to meet up with you for a ride.\u00a0 In your suggestion make it clear that the nature of the ride is fast-paced and rigorous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We are have many members that want to meet up for local leisure exercise in local streets and parks.\u00a0 Cycling is an ideal way to relieve the stress of the day and to get the 30 to 60 minutes of cardio recommended for a healthy life-style.\u00a0 The<\/span> <span>SBMG forum is the ideal way to get the benefits of cycling while also forming a network of like-minded people to socialize with before, during and after the ride.<\/span> <span>If you are interested in daily exercise bike rides that are not rigorous training ride but more leisure in nature, maybe along the route to Calf Pasture Beach in Norwalk, or between Cummings Beach and Shippan Point in Stamford, or along Shore road in Old Greenwich, or where ever, then please suggest a date, time, and place for likeminded cyclists to meet up with you for a ride.\u00a0 In your suggestion make it clear that the nature of the ride is leisure-paced and exercise oriented.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We are always looking for people to lead recreational rides throughout Connecticut and the neighboring states.\u00a0 If you are interested in exploring the many bike routes and rail\/trails in the area or doing multi-night bike touring others then please suggest a date, time, and place for likeminded cyclists to meet up with you for a ride.\u00a0 In your suggestion make it clear that the nature of the ride is leisure-paced and recreational in nature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Our most active group members are mountain bikers.\u00a0 We have novice to advanced mountain bikers that post off-road rides, mostly in Mianus River Park on the Stamford, but if you are looking to meet up with people to ride other locations then we encourage you to post suggestions.\u00a0 \u00a0In your suggestion make it clear that the nature of the ride is off-road.\u00a0 State the paced and style of your ride.\u00a0 Use descriptors such as cross-country, trail, free-ride, and dirt jumping as these are well known terms.\u00a0 Also, state if your ride suggestion is novice, intermediate, or advanced in nature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color :

Neither are we rangers. Going out with us is the same as going out with a few friends. Expect the same risks, take the same precautions. As Organizers, we will do our best to give accurate descriptions of the hikes we post. If you are a beginner in hiking, the elevation over the length of the hike and distance may not mean much to you. Likewise, difficulty ratings are subjective, and a hike that is 'Easy' to one person may be 'Moderate' to another. Err on the side of caution. You're much better off going on a hike that's too easy for you than a hike that's too hard or too dangerous for you. As you go on more hikes with us, you'll become more familiar with our ratings and our descriptions, and you'll learn more about your own limits. Ultimately, it's up to you to keep yourself safe out there.

All skill levels are welcome as long as you promise to have fun! For any beginners, please read the following 10 rules to Ultimate. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask! :)<\/p>\n<p>Ultimate in 10 Simple Rules<\/p>\n<p>1. The Field -- A rectangular shape with endzones at each end. A regulation field is 70 yards by 40 yards, with endzones 25 yards deep.<\/p>\n<p>2. Initiate Play -- Each point begins with both teams lining up on the front of their respective endzone line. The defense throws (\"pulls\") the disc to the offense. A regulation game has seven players per team.<\/p>\n<p>3. Scoring -- Each time the offense completes a pass in the defense's endzone, the offense scores a point. Play is initiated after each score.<\/p>\n<p>4. Movement of the Disc -- The disc may be advanced in any direction by completing a pass to a teammate. Players may not run with the disc. The person with the disc (\"thrower\") has ten seconds to throw the disc. The defender guarding the thrower (\"marker\") counts out the stall count.<\/p>\n<p>5. Change of possession -- When a pass in not completed (e.g. out of bounds, drop, block, interception), the defense immediately takes possession of the disc and becomes the offense.<\/p>\n<p>6. Substitutions -- Players not in the game may replace players in the game after a score and during an injury timeout.<\/p>\n<p>7. Non-contact -- No physical contact is allowed between players. Picks and screens are also prohibited. A foul occurs when contact is made.<\/p>\n<p>8. Fouls -- When a player initiates contact on another player a foul occurs. When a foul disrupts possession, the play resumes as if the possession was retained. If the player committing the foul disagrees with the foul call, the play is redone.<\/p>\n<p>9.

If you have a telescope but have had trouble assembling it or getting it to work, bring it with you and get some help. These events will be in public parks and are open to the public; so the more equipment the better.

I've played several times with his group and it's EXCELLENT. Join that here: http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MANHATTAN-INTERNATIONAL-COED-SOCCER\/ The only Manhattan Pick-up soccer group for beginners ONLY! No slide-tackling, no pushing people over, no fighting, no acting like soccer is war. This is fun, friendly and ONLY for people looking to boost their soccer skills while meeting fun new people. NOT for people who: played your whole life, considered going pro, get frustrated with a slow game, have EVER gotten in a meet-up soccer fight. FOR people who: played long, long ago, are just learning, want to improve skills, are a good player but want to help others learn (and don't mind a very slow game). Why Join? We're the only Manhattan beginning meet-up. Get outside, get great exercise, get in shape for the summer, and meet some new people ? all in a low-pressure, fun environment. This is about the fun of the game, not showing off or winning. We have games all over and are in the process of getting permits for September. This is a very informal group. Join us for practice sessions, plenty of kicking the ball around, and some games. Often, we'll meet in Central Park.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/b\/4\/5\/highres_4275173.jpeg","photo_id":4275173,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/b\/4\/5\/600_4275173.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/b\/4\/5\/thumb_4275173.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":1916848,"name":"Julie M"},"members":702,"name":"The Manhattan (Beginning) Pick-up Soccer Meetup","id":1169020,"state":"NY","urlname":"manhattanbeginningsoccer","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Pick-up Soccer Players"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1212110015000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"kenwilber","name":"Ken Wilber","id":687},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"spiraldynamics","name":"Spiral Dynamics","id":1527},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"etolle","name":"Eckhart Tolle","id":6126},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"nondualism","name":"Nondualism","id":9239},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"spiritual-psychology","name":"Spiritual Psychology","id":18507},{"urlkey":"transformation","name":"Transformation","id":21591},{"urlkey":"integral-spirituality","name":"Integral Spirituality","id":26985},{"urlkey":"evolution-of-consciousness","name":"Evolution of Consciousness","id":27989},{"urlkey":"waking-down","name":"Waking Down","id":55142},{"urlkey":"spiritual-awakening","name":"Spiritual Awakening","id":69583},{"urlkey":"waking-down-in-mutuality","name":"Waking Down in Mutuality","id":122125}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/wakingdowninmutuality\/","rating":4.97,"description":"<p>\"Waking up\" is associated with getting enlightened or free by rising out of imprisonment in your karma, body-mind, and relationships.<\/p>\n<p>\"Waking down\" differs from waking up out of life.<\/p>\n<p>Saniel Bonder is the founder of the Waking Down in Mutuality work.

Everyone is welcome, men and women, whoever wants to get some exercise, play some soccer, meet up and have a good time.<\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/c\/6\/6\/highres_402416422.jpeg","photo_id":402416422,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/c\/6\/6\/600_402416422.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/c\/6\/6\/thumb_402416422.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7595468,"name":"Quest"},"members":697,"name":"Bay Ridge FC Get back in shape pickup soccer","id":1206990,"state":"NY","urlname":"pickupsoccer-202","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Pick-up Soccer Players"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Astoria","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1214954870000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"antiques","name":"Antique Collecting","id":217},{"urlkey":"intdesign","name":"Interior Design","id":384},{"urlkey":"rughooking","name":"Rug Hooking","id":891},{"urlkey":"fengshui","name":"Feng Shui","id":1462},{"urlkey":"textilearts","name":"Textile Arts","id":3989},{"urlkey":"homeandgarden","name":"Home and Garden","id":10469},{"urlkey":"handmade-rugs","name":"Handmade Rugs","id":55265},{"urlkey":"antique-rugs-carpets","name":"Antique Rugs & Carpets","id":84333},{"urlkey":"collecting-antique-carpets-and-rugs","name":"Collecting Antique Carpets and Rugs","id":84334}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/hayko-news-events\/","rating":5,"lon":-73.9300003052,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/a\/highres_350941082.jpeg","photo_id":350941082,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/a\/600_350941082.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/a\/thumb_350941082.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":7551868,"name":"HAYKO"},"members":12,"name":"Hayko News and Events","id":1207619,"state":"NY","urlname":"hayko-news-events","category":{"name":"hobbies\/crafts","id":15,"shortname":"hobbies-crafts"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Hayko's"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Astoria","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1214954976000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"knitting","name":"Knitting","id":212},{"urlkey":"weavers","name":"Weavers","id":214},{"urlkey":"antiques","name":"Antique Collecting","id":217},{"urlkey":"textilearts","name":"Textile Arts","id":3989},{"urlkey":"craftswap","name":"Crafts","id":10099},{"urlkey":"weaving","name":"Weaving","id":22540},{"urlkey":"tapestry-weaving","name":"Tapestry Weaving","id":35047},{"urlkey":"hand-weaving","name":"Hand Weaving","id":53983},{"urlkey":"handmade-rugs","name":"Handmade Rugs","id":55265},{"urlkey":"antique-rugs-carpets","name":"Antique Rugs & Carpets","id":84333},{"urlkey":"collecting-antique-carpets-and-rugs","name":"Collecting Antique Carpets and Rugs","id":84334},{"urlkey":"antique-rugs","name":"Antique Rugs","id":84335},{"urlkey":"persian-rugs","name":"Persian Rugs","id":84336},{"urlkey":"oriental-rugs","name":"Oriental Rugs","id":90877}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/rug-weaving\/","rating":4.96,"description":"<p>The Ancient Art of Rug Weaving<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/2\/e\/3\/highres_10665795.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ;

Learn how to participate in caving adventures, whether locally on day trips, or in Pennsylvania and upstate New York on weekend trips, week long trips throughout the US, and longer expeditions throughout the world. Loaner equipment (helmets &amp; head lamps) and training provided. We are a mixed group, ranging from those who explore simple cave systems without the aid of any special technical equipment and training, to those who use ropes to rappel into deep pits on the order of hundreds of feet in depth, and scuba to explore complicated underwater passages on the order of miles in length. We also have members who specialise in such things as cave biology, photography, archeology and cartograpphy. While some of our members are new to caving, others have been involved in it for well over 20 to 30 years.

As a Holistic Health Counselor and therapist, I have lived the raw foods lifestyle for the past six years, and as many of you know, it is a life-changing way of eating.

For the past 15 years I have been working as a top professional lighting tech to professional Fashion, Catalog, Music, and Celebrity photographers from around the world, while also shooting as a professional editorial and advertising photographer. Top mag and print advertising my lighting has been in over the years: Maxim, Stuff, Vogue, Teen People, Macy's, Nordstrom, Italia Moda, Pirates of the Caribbean movie poster, Dr Pepper ads, Gieco ads, two and a half men promos, Elle Mag, Eqsuire mag, Mens health mag, and all of the 2009 Shape Mag pool\/ water cover shots just to name a few.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Class details:<\/p>\n<p>Class structure is relaxed, fun, and open forum, which means we all share knowledge together to further our knowledge as a group. You ask, I help you figure it out in a simple solution that makes sense.<\/p>\n<p>In this group I bring together like minded creative photographers. Each session I will cover more topics and different lighting situations hands on with your camera. I supply top of the line Profoto professional lighting gear used by industry professionals around the world. Classes are for beginner up to advanced photographers looking to learn or broaden their lighting skills. I also teach private lighting specific to your needs.<\/p>\n<p>By the end of the class you will be shooting studio lighting outdoors like the pros no mater what skill level you are currently.<\/p>\n<p>Some classes we will have models, others we will take time photographing each other, some events just photographing the world around us.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks again, look for upcoming events and art shows of the groups work.<\/p>\n<p>\"Create and play in an artful way\"&nbsp; &lt;br&gt; Quote by: Michael Robert Hartman<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Membership donation:<\/p>\n<p>If you can please add the $10 donation to my group( not mandatory), it is a one time fee, covers supplies, repairs to EQ, light shaping tools, art shows, tracking down sponsors, group trips, emailing people and allowing me to give these classes of such a high value at a low fee, etc...<\/p>\n<p>See my personal work at Http:\/\/www.MichaelRobertHartman.com &lt;br&gt; also watch for monthly photo contests from our sponsor: Http:\/\/www.YourSportsLife.com &lt;br&gt; I teach real life situations hands on with your camera and my portable studio lighting. 90% of all classes are held outdoors, on the beach. I show back lighting and front lighting, plus one and two light ratios, how and when to use colored gels on the lights, plus standard distance and light height. So put down the books and get to shooting today!!! I will show you insider tips on how and why we use light outdoors. It is easy, once you take my class you will wonder why you waited so long.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/3\/3\/2\/highres_433537682.jpeg","photo_id":433537682,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/3\/3\/2\/600_433537682.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/3\/3\/2\/thumb_433537682.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":5657020,"name":"Michael R.

We don't allow \"walk-ins\" unless numbers happen to be short.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the above, here's what separates this group from many others:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Chill, positive attitudes.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Excellent equipment: <span>$145 balls, and square, sturdy goals (not flimsy, circular pop-ups).<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Freshly laundered, adult-size, pillowy soft bibs.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 We won't ever over-crowd a game. The size of pitch we use is best suited for 7v7. We're happy to make the pitch smaller if numbers are low. But we won't often make it bigger or allow more than 7 players per team.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 The small fee we ask of each player (at least $3 per session) supports a non-profit that we created and run:\u00a0<span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nyisl.com\/\">a high school soccer league for under-funded schools, which don't have sufficient resources for after-school programming<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>See\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nyisl.com\/\"><span>nyisl.com<\/span><\/a> for more info. about our program for under-served public school students.<\/p>\n<p>We use your game-fee to help pay for our high school players' new soccer boots, socks, shin guards and much more (e.g., the league website, goals, and other equipment).<\/p>\n<p>We're particularly fond of\u00a0<span>in-kind donations<\/span>: soccer boots, socks, shins, shorts, etc.<\/p>\n<p><span>If you have any of the above gear, please bring it along to your game and we'll be more than happy to waive your game fee!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Please remember to RSVP (and to change your RSVP if your plans change).

If you sign up and don't show up (thereby causing the game to have uneven numbers, or worse - making it so that there aren't enough people for a game), then you'll be swiftly shown the exit!<\/p>\n<p>And PLEASE TAKE NOTE:\u00a0If you like to moan and wine at others because you don't think they've made a good enough pass, this isn't the game for you.

These types are: INFP, ENFP, INFJ, ENFJ, INTP, ENTP, INTJ, ENTJ, ISFJ, ESFJ, ISFP, ESFP, ISTP, ESTP, ISTJ, ESTJ. \r\n\r\nThis group started out with a focus on INFP's only, but that was rather narrow, and the meetups were found to be ultimately more rewarding if any and all of the 16 types could interact.\r\n\r\nThese meetups are intended to be non-structured, informal and allow for maximum interaction between members. However, those who wish and feel qualified to give a presentation on a relevant topic, are welcome to schedule it in advance by contacting the organizer. Members frequently talk about subjects besides MBTI. The main topic of this Meetup serves more as a starting point for discussion rather than as an end in itself. People are free to mingle and talk with whomever they find interesting. All personality types are equally welcome. This is the place to be if you'd like to socialize with people who share an awareness of the importance of personality.","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/c\/a\/highres_6848906.jpeg","photo_id":6848906,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/c\/a\/600_6848906.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/c\/a\/thumb_6848906.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":4126532,"name":"Sven"},"members":725,"name":"The New York City MBTI Meetup Group","id":1288361,"state":"NY","urlname":"infpnyc","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"MBTI Personality Types"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1222233166000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"camping","name":"Camping","id":374},{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"lgbtfriends","name":"LGBT","id":10050},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"backpacking","name":"Backpacking","id":18988}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/blazenyc\/","rating":4.92,"description":"<p>Join us for nights under the stars, treks in the woods and NYC events to talk about your favorite gear and the next adventure.<\/p>\n<p>BLAZE&gt;&gt; is a group for gay men in NYC that crave being outdoors and are passionate about backpacking and backcountry camping.

Gather to plan rides -- long and short. Discuss riding tips and more! This is a riding group who enjoys meeting new people and the sport of motorcycling. We are family oriented and all are welcome. We like to think of ourselves as \"Weekend Warriors\". Rides start from Oak Ridge, NJ . Rides are posted on the Calendar. Take a look and see if anything sounds like something you would like to do. As our group gets larger and experience level vary, I have to remind myself not to assume everybody knows the rules etc... or even what KSU (Kick Stands Up and we are moving) stands for, and I find myself doing that all the time. I appreciate all questions, and hey! what the heck are we doing comments that are thrown my way. For those who are new to the group, I'll go over some general things that I assume everyone know :).... First about upcoming rides, I'll watch the weather closely and I will make a determination if possible by Wednesday the week of the ride. If it's obvious that the weekend is going to be a total wash out I'll cancel the ride on Meetup. Be sure to check the site often. If Saturday looks like a better day to go riding due to weather than Sunday, I'll post that also on Meetup. If I haven't posted anything, we are going on the day I posted. If there is a slight chance of rain, please pack your rain gear. We'll go slow or pull over undercover if we get caught in a passing downpour. It's important that I have your cell numbers and you can email me if I don't exchange mine before we go for last minute stuff that may happen or the ride gets cancel. If we get to the meetup place and it's starts raining, I'll get a feel from the group what they want to do. Ride or Cancel. I'm one for taking chances the weather will be good. I really dislike sitting at home because the weather man says it's going to rain and I don't see a drop all day. It tends to really bum me out :). We typically stop throughout the ride and for sure every 100 miles for gas. I've attached a link about group riding that pretty much describe our riding group style. Please take a moment to read the General Group Riding to include, positioning, passing, group behavior and an alternate to route sheets and remember SAFETY is number one. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.motorcyclesafety.state.mn.us\/latest\/MMSC_PFHome.asp?mid=84\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.motorcyclesafety.state.mn.us\/lat...<\/a><\/p>","lon":-74.3700027466,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/9\/9\/5\/highres_441494741.jpeg","photo_id":441494741,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/9\/9\/5\/600_441494741.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/9\/9\/5\/thumb_441494741.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11152345,"name":"Rick Merchant"},"members":137,"name":"NJ Weekend Warriors Motorcycle Meetup Group","id":1312311,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Weekend-Warriors","category":{"name":"cars\/motorcycles","id":3,"shortname":"cars-motorcycles"},"lat":41.0900001526,"who":"Motorcyclists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Corona","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1225586681000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"jehovahswitness","name":"Jehovah's Witnesses","id":1219},{"urlkey":"cultwatch","name":"Cultwatch","id":1331},{"urlkey":"freedomofreligion","name":"Freedom of Religion","id":1760},{"urlkey":"ex-jehovahs-witnesses","name":"Ex-Jehovah's Witnesses","id":30329}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Formerly-ReligiousNYC\/","rating":4.78,"description":"<p>This group was formerly known as NYC - Happy Ex-JW Survivors Meetup. We are currently undergoing some changes? Why? Well we will still keep JW and related tags connected to this group for search purposes. But we have found that one of the big needs exJWs or ex-anything for that matter is interaction was a wide variety of people. Integration into society is essential. So there is room here for small events incorporating one denomination as well as larger ones for several denominations.<\/p>\n<p>It should be noted that t<span>his is a secret group, only for formerly religious people living in the NYC area. We will be pre-screening members. Again the purpose of this group is for socializing and getting our respective ex-religious groups (or all of us) together for events, while at the same time maintaining some privacy for those who may need it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Formerly Religious is for people who have left their religions, especially fervently religious, fundamentalist, and orthodox sects. This group is designed for people who no longer believe in the faith they were raised in, such as Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Hinduism; i.e. atheists, agnostics, and deists or \u201cspiritual\u201d individuals who may or may not believe in a higher power. We think we are going to find a lot of commonality, and find support around our shared challenges. This is a group for socialization, discussion, friendship, and fun (but not proselytizing). If you think you are a fit, please join us! \u00a0Please Note: This group is NOT for supporters or the curious. \u00a0We are trying to create a community of people with similar backgrounds. \u00a0Thank you for understanding...<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We can learn from both the similarities and differences in our backgrounds and the challenges faced by those leaving our religious groups and the communities within those groups. Also, there may be organizations which serve the needs of the e<\/span><span>x-religious across religions, since we face so many common challenges; struggles with family and making new friends, divorces and custody disputes, stunted educations, overcoming indoctrination, gay rights, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We might also at some point be able to work together on political or legislative issues which concern us all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>A few things: (1) Please only post things in this group which are relevant to everyone in this group. That would include anything of interest to ex-religious people in NYC generally or anything an ex-religious group is doing which is open to all of us. If a group has a meeting and it only for that group, please do not post here, because people might mistakenly think it is an open meeting. If you are just posting a general interest story, it's probably better to post in the large Formerly Religious group with over 1,000 members:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/FormerlyReligious\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/FormerlyReligious\/<\/a> (note: that group is closed, not secret, and while problematic members are removed, people are not pre-screened before they are let in).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>(2) If you know someone who left an orthodox\/fundamentalist faith living in the NYC area who would like to join us, please add them. If the moderators of this group do not know the person personally, they may inquire about the person. PLEASE DON'T ADD ANYONE YOU HAVE NOT MET IN PERSON, regardless of how well you think you know them in cyberspace. We are trying to keep this group as secure as possible, and it is impossible to really know the identity of people nobody has meet offline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>(3) It is of course vital that everyone keep this group's membership, events, and posts secret.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>(4) Please don't leave us! This is a unique group, and while we're not yet sure what we are going to do with the group, some good things should happen. One person has already contacted me about doing a panel of ex-religious people from different religions.

(while having fun!). Additionally, it is meant to be an environment where parents that are interested in fostering a bilingual experience for their kids can meet up to share stories, develop friendships and perhaps even learn some Chinese themselves!

Yes, Gotham is our city, our hometown, whether by birth or adoption! So let\u2019s see the sites that make Gotham aka New York City so unique in the world.

Second, lecture or film events at these venues usually have very limited seating, meaning I have to get there early and hold the number of seats we need, often against very aggressive people. That means we really need to have an accurate count for our rsvps, especially since our events almost always have a waiting list. <strong>If for whatever reason after you have rsvp'd yes, your plans change and you cannot attend, please change your rsvp as early as possible<\/strong> both so that those on the waiting list can get a seat at an event, and so I know when all attendees are assembled and can relax my stance against \"aggressors\". Also, <strong>because the total number of rsvps is so small, on most events there will not be an option to bring a guest.

When the group was in Boston, the members all pledged to write something ambitious and potentially life changing, and that was such a rewarding experience. We even wrote and published a book called \"Seven At The Sevens,\" which is for sale on WritersAnonymous.org and Amazon. Also, if you do a Google search for \"Seven At The Sevens,\" it's the first item that pops up! While there, you can also find our NPR interview about the book.&nbsp;Although we ended up publishing a book, the group\u2019s main mission was about keeping each other\u2019s writing going and on track, and holding each writer accountable to his\/her own self-imposed but ambitious goals. The main purpose of WritersAnonymous.org was <i>not<\/i> about publishing a book or to have each other\u2019s writings critiqued, although that can and did happen.<\/p>\n<p>Further, WritersAnonymous is about being inspired by peers and inspiring others to find their own voices. It is about connecting with people who have a similar passion in life and who may understand you a little better because they have the same burning desire to tell a story in whatever written form it may emerge. It is also about forging new and lasting friendships in a supportive and encouraging environment during the often lonely and difficult creative writing process. <\/p>\n<p>So, want to write and create something worthwhile, and also equally help others in their literary journeys?

Welcome to Fight Slavery Now! Thank you for choosing to make a difference.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We are an all volunteer grass-roots organization of regular folks like yourself.<\/strong> Most of us initially knew little about this subject, or else believed that incidents were few and far away. But when we learned the truth, we knew we had to try to do something about it. We used Meetup.com to come together seeking a course of action. Though we are diverse in our backgrounds, outlooks and ages... we have become united in our outrage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Founded at the end of 2008, we are still a fledgling group.<\/strong> This is a very exciting time to become involved as we are actively seeking new ideas and approaches as we continue to learn. Your participation will be highly valued. Additionally we are encouraged that the political climate has become somewhat more receptive, both locally and on the international stage, to addressing this debasing crime.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The sex trafficking industry overwhelmingly preys on young women and children.<\/strong> The slave labor markets rely on a ready supply of men and women fleeing desperate circumstance. Threats, trickery and false promises are the essential tools used by traffickers. Once under their control, victims find only abuse, humiliation, and endless exploitation. This is the face of modern-day slavery.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Because of its low visibility, too little is being done to combat this crime.<\/strong> Reliable statistics are scarce, but estimates run as high as 27 million people currently in some form of slave bondage. Not all trafficking is across borders. Many people are trafficked right here within the United States. Specific laws against Trafficking in Persons were formulated only in this decade, and in New York State only in 2007.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Meet other local people who are interested in the fight against modern-day slavery.<\/strong> Discuss how we can best educate ourselves and others, what actions individual citizens can take, and how we can join with others to end this abuse flourishing in our midst.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>This movement needs all the help and all the talent it can muster. We need speakers and writers, doers and dreamers. We need wit and reason, passion and caring. People wise in the ways of politics. People with business savvy. People with organizing skills. We need artists\u00a0and\u00a0singers, poets and preachers. We need everyone who cares, all the men, women, and children who are willing to work to end slavery in our generation.

In addition, we donate food and volunteer time to established shelters and soup kitchens in need of financial and human resources. We also help Friends in Need distribute warm clothing and accessories during the cold winter months and offer assistance to families through our Family Support Program. The feeding programs were initiated in New York City, Newark, Philadelphia, and Miami. We now have regular programs in New York, New Jersey, Florida and Philadelphia.

We discuss the films we watch over drinks or a nice meal.\u00a0 We love to meet and socialize with new and old friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">Your Organizer: Milton Sandoval, sandoval.milton8@gmail.com<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">Any suggestions for movies or events are always welcome with a smile :) Just drop me an email!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong><span>OUR MOVIE NIGHTS<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">Our movie nights are truly fun and provide you with a comfortable and enjoyable atmosphere that allows you to meet and socialize with other movie fans like you. If you RSVPed for the movie you MUST come to the activity we have planned afterwards, we don't want people to come just for the movie, we want people who want to come to the movie, have a great night and make new friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">Most common reasons to join this group:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">1- \"Hate going to the movies alone\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">2- \"I love movies and make friends\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">3- \"I love talking about movies\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">This is why you must come to the mix and mingle afterwards, and why the $3.00 will only be refunded to those attending the whole event: movie &amp; dinner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color : #000000\">MEMBERSHIP DUES<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">We require a one time $3.00 payment to join this group. This is not a money generating group so this $3.00 (membership dues) helps to keeps this group running, this helps pay for meetup fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong><span>WHAT MOVIES AND WHERE DO WE GO?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">We watch all kinds of movies: mainstream, indie, thriller, comedy, drama, foreign films (Spanish, French, etc with English subtitles), and anything interesting. Always know that I welcome your input and ideas.

We want to experience different areas and different theaters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong><span>WHAT ARE THE $16.00-24.00 FOR?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">The $16.00 include your movie ticket and Meetup fees. When you RSVP 'YES' you will be asked to make an Amazon Payment for $16.00 for a regular movie, and $24.00 for an IMAX movie.\u00a0 When you show up at the movie theater, find the organizer or assistant organizer in charge of the event. They will have your movie ticket. YOU DO NOT NEED TO PURCHASE A SEPERATE TICKET, THE $16.00\/$24.00 FEE INCLUDES YOUR MOVIE TICKET.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">If you can't find me (your organizer) or the assistant organizer in charge of the event call us on our cell which will be e-mailed to you previous to the event.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">After the event concludes, $3 will be refunded to you via amazon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong><span>REFUND RULES<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">* Full refund if Meetup is cancelled (no exceptions).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">* No refund when you RSVPed but fail to attend:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">For some events we have to limit the number of attendees due to the limited seating we are able to book. When you RSVPed you are taking a spot, a seat, a ticket. If you RSVPed and fail to attend, you are preventing someone else to come and have a blast. Someone else who might really wants to come and enjoy the event. So if you RSVPed for an event but have a change of plans, kindly change your RSVP status within 24 hours. This will allow others to change their plans also.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">1st no-show: If you fail to do so, your name will be put on the blacklist (no-show list).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">2nd no-show: We will kindly remove you from the group, because it is not fair to others... it's not fair to you! We keep track of no-shows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">Please also note that you lose every right for a refund when making an Amazon Payment.

Specific meetups will address: \r\n*Moxibustion, cupping, gua sha\/Kirik\r\n*Mei Zen facial acupuncture.(Sometimes called \"Acupuncture Face lift\"). Meetup will discuss what it is, how it works, and what results can be expected. Meetup will include screening for suitability.\r\n* Reflexes and what they means in KM Style. Members can participate in an evaluation of their personal reflexes, discuss why they may have them and see what it takes to change them. Those who may not want to be evaluated for the edification of the group may make  arrangements for a private reflex analysis at the end of the meetup, time permitting. \r\n*Gua Sha in the family. Gua Sha has been used successfully for centuries in the family to fight  the common cold, flu, and muscular aches and pains, just to name a few applications. It uses simple tools that are easily acquired, and it is easy to learn- although it may take a lifetime to master! ( You don't have to be a master to get good results and reap the health benefits for your family). It is time to introduce this simple yet profound technique to the American mainstream. This meetup group will attempt to do just that. We will also discuss possible legal pitfalls when using Gua Sha with children and the elderly and what you can do to prevent misunderstandings in your community.  This technique has many names in many countries, Gua Sha is but one name, another well known name is Kirik. Most people find it very pleasant and relaxing- somewhat on the level of a deep tissue massage. \r\n* Acupuncture and Western Medicine\/ where does acupuncture fit in the big picture of your personal healthcare?\r\n* Topical discussions of Acupuncture and the symptoms of: Acute or chronic injuries from sports and martial arts training, Diabetes, Hypertension, Low blood pressure, Insomnia, Lung problems, Thyroid issues, Sinus problems, Heart conditions, Low platelet count, Cancer, COPD,  Edema, Poor Circulation, Knee or Joint pain, Back Pain, Migraines and Headaches, Infertility, Stroke, Calf Pain or Spasms, Weight loss, Kidney disease, Cystic Fibrosis, Fatty Liver, Inflammation in the body,  Musclular Spasms, Substance Abuse Cessation (cigarrette, alcohol, controlled or illegal substances): or any topic brought up during the meetup. ( The proceeding list is by no means complete, topics will be discussed in the order that most participants are interested in, there may be multiple sessions per topic, or multiple topics per session- time  and interest permitting).","lon":-73.8600006104,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/a\/1\/highres_6976801.jpeg","photo_id":6976801,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/a\/1\/600_6976801.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/a\/1\/thumb_6976801.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8679590,"name":"Toni King"},"members":51,"name":"Spotted Tiger Acupuncture Meetup group","id":1359082,"state":"NY","urlname":"Spotted-Tiger-Acupuncture-Meetup-Group","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":41.0800018311,"who":"Acupuncture\/Wellness enthusiast"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1232134904000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"reggae","name":"Reggae","id":126},{"urlkey":"ac-christians","name":"Progressive Christian","id":1192},{"urlkey":"gospel","name":"Gospel Music","id":3450},{"urlkey":"christiansocial","name":"Christian Social","id":10187}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ReggaeGospel\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Meet other local Reggae Gospel fans.<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/e\/1\/6\/highres_6952758.jpeg","photo_id":6952758,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/e\/1\/6\/600_6952758.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/e\/1\/6\/thumb_6952758.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":4284601,"name":"grace"},"members":32,"name":"Reggae Gospel","id":1359591,"state":"NY","urlname":"ReggaeGospel","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Reggae Gospel Fans"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1232146023000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"chwriters","name":"Christian Writers","id":539},{"urlkey":"bornagain","name":"Born Again Christian","id":602},{"urlkey":"biblestudy","name":"Bible Study","id":2353},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"christianmin","name":"Christian Ministry","id":6623},{"urlkey":"christiansocial","name":"Christian Social","id":10187},{"urlkey":"literature","name":"Literature","id":15321},{"urlkey":"reading","name":"Reading","id":15360},{"urlkey":"novel-reading","name":"Novel Reading","id":15622},{"urlkey":"prayer","name":"Prayer","id":16040},{"urlkey":"christian-singles","name":"Christian Singles","id":16271},{"urlkey":"jesus-christ","name":"Jesus Christ","id":20589}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Christian-Fiction-and-More-Meetup-Group\/","rating":4.92,"description":"<p>This meet-up is for individuals who enjoy Christian fiction as well as Christian concerts and art exhibits.&nbsp;

The book is a collection of 196 papers that its authors say is a divine revelation to our planet. The revelators assert that they are non-physical beings, ranging from those divine in origin to those closer to the level of human beings, such as angels. How the papers came to be transmitted into written form is not completely known.The papers started to be collected in the 1930s and were first published as The Urantia Book in 1955. We read sequentially through the book, stopping as people have comments or questions, and we are able to experience together the book's life-affirming message of Sonship with God, as well as the wealth of details on such subjects as: the possibilities that exist for an individual after physical death; what the soul is; how life developed on earth over time; a description of the various orders of divine and semi-divine beings; and a year-by-year account of the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, also referred to in the book as the Creator Son of our local universe. <br> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br> This Group meets at CAP Studios located at 18 West 18th Street.

Sometimes we also invite guest speakers \u2013 past guests include Columbia University bioethicist and author Jacob Appel; the co-founder of Givewell, Holden Karnofsky; the president of the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Michael Vassar; and the A.I. researcher and rationality blogger Eliezer Yudkowsky.<\/p>\n<p>To give you an idea of what our meetings tend to be about, here are a few representative examples:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Five Minute Lectures<\/strong> |\u00a0 Everyone was invited to give an informal five-minute talk on a topic of their choice.

Events at our midtown location are open to all ages, our downtown location is 21 and over (ID is required). <br><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<b>Draw-mania!<\/b> is our monthly extravaganza--a four-hour draw-a-thon and variety show in a tiki bar! Every third Thursday of the month, you can expect four outstanding art models, a terrific DJ offering music that is conducive and inspiring to artistic creation (at least for most artists), and cutting edge music, comedy and performance art interspersed throughout the night. And if all of that doesn't inspire you, We're located in NYC's most fun and eclectic tiki bars, where you can find colorful and tasty drinkable inspiration! This event is strictly 21 and over, and ID is required. (While you are welcome to enjoy the bartender's creations, there is no requirement to indulge and beverages are not included in the entry price).<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Jerry's Draw-mania!<\/b> is a weekly 2-hour figure drawing event hosted by Jerry's Palette Shop in Manhattan. It's features one non-nude model in long and short poses. Since it's in one of the top art stores, you have the option of purchasing materials at the event if you need them. At only FIVE DOLLARS per session, it's one of the best deals in the art world! These events are one of our few non-nude events, and are open to all ages. <br><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<b>We also have special events throughout the year,<\/b> including short boat trips, classes and seminars with an instructor, and social gatherings where you can get to know your fellow artists. <br><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<i>Occasionally we will feature events on our site that are not \"our\" events, but which may be of interest to our members.<\/i> Most recently these have included the Art and Design High School Annual Draw-a-thon, and Michael Alan's Living Installation.

In the wildest, most secluded acres, trees rise 100 to 130 feet and are often over 200 years old. Awed hikers feel hundreds of miles and years away from the cities in such primeval forests\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The sanctuary is largely an oak forest, especially along the cliff edge where red oaks, hickory, and black birch dominate. In cooler, moister, more fertile coves, sugar maple, beech, dogwood, and tulip trees are common. Swampy, poorly drained areas are covered with red maple, sweet gum, elm, tupelo, hornbeam, pin oak, ash, and willow. Common shrubs are maple-leaf viburnum, witch hazel, laurel, blueberry, wild azalea, poison ivy, grape, and, in wet areas, spicebush.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Starting in early spring, before the trees produce their leaves, the sanctuary experiences a parade of colorful wildflowers springing up from the forest floor, and the fiddleheads of twenty species of native ferns uncoiling from the dead leaves. This paralleled in late summer and fall by an amazing variety of mushrooms, shelf fungi, and slime molds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>A five-acre pond with small adjoining bog increase the great diversity of this sanctuary. The 250-foot Greenbrook Falls is one of three major streams which drain the area and tumble down the ancient diabase cliffs into the Hudson River. Views of these waterfalls, the Palisades and Highlands to the north, and the densely populated cities across the Hudson, are possible from several promontories which look down 350 feet into the river.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>250+ species of birds have been identified in the sanctuary.<\/span> <br> <span>Mammals include the nocturnal raccoon, red fox, striped skunk, gray squirrels, chipmunk, muskrat, cotton-tail rabbit, and the secretive white-footed mouse, short-tailed shrew, and common mole. Deer, opossums, weasels, flying squirrels, and red bats are also occasionally seen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Each March, the pond, bog, and swamps fill with the egg masses of wood frogs and spotted salamanders. The dominant reptiles are eastern garter and northern water snakes, and painted and snapping turtles.<\/span><\/p>","lon":-73.9300003052,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/8\/0\/b\/highres_438206635.jpeg","photo_id":438206635,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/8\/0\/b\/600_438206635.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/8\/0\/b\/thumb_438206635.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":9381858,"name":"Mike Gallo"},"members":189,"name":"Greenbrook Nature Sanctuary","id":1437742,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Greenbrook-Nature-Sanctuary","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.9500007629,"who":"Greenbrook Sanctuary MU Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"members","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1240137566000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"pregnancy","name":"Pregnancy","id":239},{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"childbirth-education","name":"Childbirth Education","id":17544},{"urlkey":"first-time-pregnant-moms","name":"First-Time Pregnant Moms","id":20676},{"urlkey":"support-during-first-pregnancy","name":"Support During First Pregnancy","id":20677},{"urlkey":"new-parents","name":"New Parents","id":30112},{"urlkey":"expecting-multiples","name":"Expecting Multiples","id":39373},{"urlkey":"expecting-moms","name":"Expecting Moms","id":47157},{"urlkey":"pregnant-mom-support","name":"Pregnant Mom Support","id":55500},{"urlkey":"childbirth-preparation","name":"Childbirth Preparation","id":64287},{"urlkey":"new-to-town-and-pregnant","name":"New to Town and Pregnant","id":95804},{"urlkey":"new-and-expecting-jewish-parents","name":"New and Expecting Jewish Parents","id":114879},{"urlkey":"expecting-parents","name":"Expecting Parents","id":726142}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/childbirthclassesnyc\/","rating":4.97,"description":"<p>ARE YOU EXPECTING WITHIN THE NEXT 9 MONTHS?<\/p>\n<p>We are a group of expectant moms who get together to share resources for making our lives in New York City easier, more productive, saner, and chat all things baby and how to be best prepare for new motherhood!<\/p>\n<p>We are are celebrating our sixth year connecting moms in the groups!<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Our Signature Moms groups have been rated a NYC must and are an amazing way to quickly and easily connect with other expecting and new moms in your neighborhood, make new friends, gather essential resources, and learn about fun things around town.<\/p>\n<p>If you are eager to meet other expectant moms, want to learn as much as you can about expecting and being a new mom and want to become part of an amazing, friendly, &amp; supportive community - join us!

Meditation is about being more. It gives you strength and centeredness to go beyond your limits. Beyond relaxation, this style of meditation raises the voltage of consciousness. Develop inner stillness and sharper awareness. Learn how not to get rocked by the waves around you. A key principle is see for yourself, know for yourself. The techniques lead to a development of vision that cuts through appearances and perceives the reality of the world and yourself. The meditation techniques that we use at Vital Switch are all from the techniques of the Clairvision School of meditation. The techniques are based on the principles of the third eye meditation in the book \"Awakening The Third Eye\" by Dr. Samuel Sagan - founder of the Clairvision School. This Meetup group is run by the New York-based wellness group, Vital Switch. Vital Switch offers a whole system of meditation which includes skills for stress relief and vitality management. The technique presented in the New York Meditation meetup will be one which helps to boost mental clarity and get you in touch with your life force. This is not based on any religion or dogma, rather it is a whole system of meditation skills that is developed for modern people who want to transform themselves. Ideal for anyone interested in learning a regular meditation practice. It is also good for those interested in awareness techniques they can apply at work or at home while going about their daily activities. The Vital Switch system will deliver stress relief, relief from burnout, help with chronic fatigue syndrome, improve mental clarity and alertness. It also offers tools for focusing at will, and methods to gain better sleep quality.

That means we'll be counting on you to give us your confirmation of attendance as early as possible.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n There is a $3 annual fee to join this group that covers operational expenses. New members are asked to pay via PayPal.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Our objective is to have a great time every time. To achieve that, we strictly observe one rule: If you sign up to attend, please make every effort to keep that commitment. If an emergency arises, please make an effort to change your status on our web site or contact me. We ask members to lock in their attendance status by Saturday noon for all Sunday events and cancel ONLY for emergency.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n WE PERMANENTLY REMOVE ANYONE WHO FAILS TO SHOW UP AND FAILS TO NOTIFY US BEFOREHAND. WE DON'T ASK QUESTIONS AND WE DON'T MAKE EXCEPTIONS.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Removal from the group doesn't mean we don't like you or that you're a bad person. It means your perspective on attendance is at odds with ours; we take attendance [i]very seriously[\/i]. We can't afford not to because\u00a0 no-shows hurt our relations with restaurants and make it more difficult to negotiate the best deals. It can also throw off our seating arrangements and numbers of tables allotted to us. It also is an insult to fellow members who may be basing their decision to attend on who else is attending.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n A couple other requirements: We require all who wish to become members of this group to post a recent photo of themselves. There may be no other faces - family, friends, any one else - in the picture. No pets or animals. And no poses that would be contrary to the image of this group. Your guideline should be: Post an image that you would be proud to use on a job application.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Also, we respectfully request that if you wish to bring guests, have them sign up as members of our group -- there is no charge and the process is quick -- and then have them sign up on their own to attend. Please DO NOT add the words \"Bringing a guest\" when you indicate you will be attending. You will be switched to a waiting list until such wording is removed and your guests sign up separately.<\/p>\n<p>Last, your Meetup profile must be unblocked. If you do not wish to publicize your profile, we are sorry but we would request you seek another group to join.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Questions, suggestions? Please don't hesitate to contact me.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n You may reach me at 201 675-5840.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n See you soon!<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Peter G<br>\n\n<br>\n\n * * *<\/p>","lon":-74.1100006104,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/9\/b\/c\/highres_161662972.jpeg","photo_id":161662972,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/9\/b\/c\/600_161662972.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/9\/b\/c\/thumb_161662972.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7903817,"name":"Peter G"},"members":729,"name":"Bergen County Singles Dining Group - 40s to 50s","id":1443795,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Bergen-County-Singles-Dining-Group-40s-to-50s","category":{"name":"singles","id":30,"shortname":"singles"},"lat":40.9799995422,"who":"members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1240807917000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"electronicmusic","name":"Electronic Music","id":411},{"urlkey":"jpop","name":"Japanese Pop","id":508},{"urlkey":"housemusic","name":"House Music","id":6672},{"urlkey":"clubbing","name":"Clubbing","id":17969},{"urlkey":"electronic-dance-music","name":"Electronic Dance Music","id":17970},{"urlkey":"dance-music","name":"dance music","id":17971},{"urlkey":"trance-music","name":"Trance Music","id":80398}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TranceMansion\/","rating":4.57,"description":"<p><span style=\"color : #b22222 ; font-size : x-small\">\"A silky euphoria, sublime textures of neon light woven through a madd rush of kaleidoscopic sparks and manic speed, draped over a relentless, thumping consonance, connecting us as 1 joyful, beating, organism\"<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><span style=\"text-align : justify ; color : #ffffff\"><span style=\"font-size : x-small\"><span style=\"color : #b22222\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><span style=\"color : #b22222\">-- trance, def.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color : #fbfdee\"><span style=\"text-align : justify\"><span style=\"font-size : 11px\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size : x-small\">NEW YORK, ARE YOU READY TO TRANCE INTO 2011?<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color : #fffef9\"><span style=\"font-size : x-small\"><span style=\"color : #fbfdee\">We're gonna be bustin' out into 2011 with parties and events that'll move and exhilarate you with the most uplifting and danceable progressive trance in nyc.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color : #fffef9\"><span style=\"font-size : x-small\"><span style=\"color : #fbfdee\">What could be better than the sublime music, the positive and absolutely beautiful trancephiles you'll be partying with.

We also have personal services pros including financial planners, caterers, residential real estate and mortgage brokers.<\/p>\r\n<p>At each meeting our members deliver 60-second commercials to all members on products and services.  We then  allow one member to deliver an in-depth 10-minute presentation on their company.&nbsp; Best of all, you have a team of 15-20 business professionals that work for YOU.

For those who want more, then, we provide personalized meditation tools that deepen and expand inner peace and, ultimately, lead in the direction of complete Self-realization. What could be bad about that?<\/p>\n<p>Anyone is invited to visit one of our support group meetings.<\/p>\n<p>When? We have a meeting every Wednesday evening at 7:30 and every Saturday afternoon at 2 pm -- except for the first Saturday of the month. \u00a0On the first Saturday we meet at 5 pm and most of us stay on for a potluck.<\/p>\n<p>Members can come to any or all of those meetings -- no advance notice is necessary.

Yet, Italian Cinema is so much more. Since the beginning of the history of film, Italian Cinema has continually introduced innovative directors and talented actors, screenwriters, composers, set designers, and costume designers to the world. The Cine-Club: 79 Years of Italian Film (1930-2009) allows participants to discover cinematic gems and contemplate diverse themes in Italian life. Represented in the film series are classics, such as: I Tartassati (1959); Il medico della mutua (1968); Il giorno della civetta (1968); Indagine su un cittadino al di sopra di ogni sospetto (1970) ; and In nome del popolo italiano (1971). The Italia Today films (1980-present) offer an especially rare look at Italian contemporary cinema and society with films, including: Ricordati di Me (2003); Manuale d\u2019Amore 2 (2007); Il divo (2008); and Bianco e Nero (2008). The screenings include discussions on history of film and present-day Italian cinema, the protagonists, and themes that the films explore: from love and politics to family and immigration\u2014revealing the Italian way of life for more than half a century.

Through pragmatic monthly workshop discussions, lectures, master class series, concert and recital performances, competitions, outreach programs and education for singers, accompanists and the broader public, ASPS plans to ensure that New York&rsquo;s classical singers, accompanists and art song enthusiasts always have access to performing and\/or appreciating this area of classical vocal literature through the financial support of patrons and grants for the arts. ASPS also promotes the art song through showcasing the talents of a roster of singers who make up this unique art song company. ASPS will advance the art song by servicing three groups: 1) singers, teachers, accompanists, and performers; 2) composers and academic researchers and 3) non-singing enthusiasts and the public community. The organization is designed to help these groups explore and develop a sense of the rich repertoire by such great composers as Schubert, Strauss, Wolf, Faure, Duparc, Debussy, Purcell, Dowland, Britten, Barber, Duke, Rorem and many more including contemporary composers of the genre. Our organization gives emerging and established composers of the art song a place to make themselves known to their key public &ndash; singers, teachers, accompanists and enthusiasts! Since the text from an art song is derived from poetry, the fact that it is the unification of two art forms - the poetic text and music &ndash; makes it one of the greatest (albeit oftentimes most neglected) gifts in the realm of classical music. When the ideal proportions are met: the heartfelt piano accompaniment, the exquisite voice and the endearing poetry; one cannot help but be affected by it. It touches the mind. It touches the soul. It touches humanity. This is a refuge for emerging concert recitalists! &ldquo;If Music Be The Food of Love, Sing on, Sing on, Sing on!&rdquo;. So if you have a genuine interest in the fusion of word and tone, rhythm of language, and the quality and beauty of the human voice, come experience the exuberance and joy of art song singing. The Art Song Preservation Society of NY: Where music speaks and words sing!

It\u2019s unlike all of the other meetup groups out there, it\u2019s comprised of only network marketers. You might think since someone is already involved in an MLM business, that they wouldn\u2019t be a good prospect for you. Some of the largest industry leaders have discovered that the best prospects for their MLM business are other \u201cnetworkers\u201d, people that are already involved within the MLM industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> They\u2019ve figured out that some \u201cnetworkers\u201d haven\u2019t found the right \u201chome\u201d for themselves yet, but they already have the skills of prospecting, handling objections, dealing with rejection, doing presentations, and many of the other skill sets needed to build a successful network marketing business. <br> <br> Whether you're new to the industry, or you\u2019re a seasoned veteran, you will have the opportunity to network with these other like minded individuals at our events. Here\u2019s what you can expect from our events:<\/p>\n<p>Generic industry training no matter what company you are involved with. &nbsp;You will hear from a multi-million dollar earner on how and where they find leaders. &nbsp;You will also learn the importance of having duplicatable marketing systems once you have exhausted your warm market, to continually grow your business.<\/p>\n<p>The opportunity to give a 5 minute overview about your company and opportunity. &nbsp;We will be highlighting the individual who has the most new attendees at each event. &nbsp;Why are we doing this? &nbsp;Because that\u2019s how we will continually expand to have the largest network marketers meetup group in the area, which allows you to do what this group is all about.. network with other \u201cnetworkers\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The time to network and build relationships with other \u201cnetworkers\u201d, which could potentially lead to future business partners. &nbsp;Also, find out how others have built their businesses, and what\u2019s working for them now.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy a fun filled evening in a professional and relaxed environment.<\/p>\n<p>We will not be sharing our business and what we do at these event. These events are about giving back our knowledge to help people see the great potential benefits of building long-term residual income, while offering a great networking environment for those individuals looking to create an extraordinary life, through the promise of what this industry promotes.<\/p>\n<p>About The Organizers: <br> <br> You will have the chance to learn from some of the most talented minds in the network marketing industry.

It is our contention that Bruce Lee was a superior martial artist not because of how he chipped away at his own martial art tradition but rather because he actually had deep roots in a tradition to subsequently able him to chip away from. So, rather than focusing on Bruce's later result, the philosophical concept of JKD, we are trying to walk Lee's first path and gain a firm foundation in Ip Man Wing Chun to then one day \"make our own\".

Based on Michael Janich\u2019s extensive analysis of the Filipino martial arts and many other systems, MBC takes combat-proven tactics and adapts them to modern tools, threats, and legal concerns. The result is a practical, easy-to-learn system that is ideally suited to modern self-defense. <br> <br> Like all real self-defense, MBC tactics focus on 'stopping power' - the ability to immediately and decisively stop an assailant from continuing his attack.

One solution is retraining on a massive scale and a \u201cgrass roots\u201d social networking and small business development program.&nbsp; The problem is one of resource allocation.&nbsp; We are proposing a New Industrial Policy to retrain aging Baby Boomers and \u201cdownsized\u201d others so as to best utilize their collective experience and transferable skills and to harness them for the New Global Economy and the 21st Century.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cLet\u2019s turn the ME generation into the WE generation\u2026\u201d<\/strong><\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/1\/3\/3\/highres_434933555.jpeg","photo_id":434933555,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/1\/3\/3\/600_434933555.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/1\/3\/3\/thumb_434933555.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":18186101,"name":"Jill Markowitz"},"members":38,"name":"I Can Still Do That","id":1466871,"state":"NY","urlname":"StillDoThat","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Friends"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1244157733000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"science","name":"Science","id":85},{"urlkey":"future","name":"Futurology","id":429},{"urlkey":"singularity","name":"singularity","id":434},{"urlkey":"ai","name":"Artificial Intelligence","id":456},{"urlkey":"robotics","name":"Robotics","id":682},{"urlkey":"transhumanism","name":"Transhumanism","id":2234},{"urlkey":"space","name":"Space Exploration","id":5933},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"antiaging","name":"Anti-Aging","id":9862},{"urlkey":"nanotechnology","name":"Nanotechnology","id":21106},{"urlkey":"technological-singularity","name":"Technological Singularity","id":23357},{"urlkey":"emerging-technologies","name":"Emerging Technologies","id":69962},{"urlkey":"neurotechnology","name":"Neurotechnology","id":120848}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/futurismnyc\/","rating":4.49,"description":"<p>Are you interested in meeting with like-minded individuals to discuss how technology will shape the future of humanity? <a href=\"http:\/\/www.futurismnyc.com\/\">FuturismNYC<\/a> is a group that engages in thought provoking discussions around all future-tech related topics, with&nbsp;<span>conversations oftentimes led by esteemed guests.

Bugs, squirrels, leaks, pigeons, ice, heat, wind, broken umbrellas. Not to mention lugging bags of expensive dirt up long staircases and tethering your plants with wire so they won't get blown off the edge. Members will meet up to visit other peoples' decks, gardens, etc. and enjoy enthusiasms and views. We'll trade ideas about flowers, trees, structural aspects, and share in the pleasures of helping green things to survive in a tough environment. What makes it all worthwhile? The sky above, the rustle of leaves in the breeze on a hot summer night. You don't have to have a deck to belong, just an active interest in growing plants in the city.
