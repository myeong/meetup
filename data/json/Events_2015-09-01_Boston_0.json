At Gillette Stadium on Saturday, August 1st, we can dash through an adventure peppered with oversized obstacles inspired by the program's original and official course, including slides slicked with soap suds, padded wrecking balls, and steep inflated slides. Once we conquer the gauntlet of swings and climbing walls, we'll zoom to the finish line down a four-story water slide.

It has a lot of features that I am sure you would have fun with.<\/p> <p>If you can, let me know if you will be walking with us, so we don\u2019t start without you. If we are all gathered before 8 we tend to just get going at that point.<\/p> <p>If you are interested in joining our walking club, either this time or sometime in the future, please let me know and I will include you on that email list.<br\/>Laureen House [masked]<\/p>",

Some people avoid the parking fee by parking near Concord High School and then walk\/ride their bike over to Walden.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mass.gov\/dcr\/parks\/trails\/walden.pdf\">Click here for the map of the parking<\/a>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/f\/f\/4\/event_118056852.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Across and back from the beach (Pictured above) is a little over a mile mile; a perfect distance for those training for 70.3 and Ironman races.<\/p> <p>There are also some close to shore routes for people getting better acquainted with open water (see distance maps). We meet near the lifeguard house right on the beach closes to Walden street. Here is the map of walden pond.<\/p> <p>This meetup is important because you always want to swim in groups if you can. Make certain that you look out for each other. Don't attempt to swim across the pond if you haven't trained for that distance. Always match up with someone or a group that swims your pace. The beauty of Walden is that you can swim very close to shallow water and get some good open water training in.<\/p> <p>If there are people that are looking to go long for the first time, let me know in advance and I may be able to swim angel, or get a swim angel group together. That way we can do it in a controlled and safe environment.<\/p> <p>For those that are really new and nervous about open water swimming, stay tuned for a beginners clinic that I'll put on in the summer.<\/p>",

This is a fun bunch of people, all dressed to the nine's in some seriously intricate outfits, and almost all dying to have their photo taken. It's a \"target rich environment\" for portrait photographers into outdoor work and over the top people. If you have one, I'd recommend you bring an off camera flash to tame some of those shadows a bright morning sun can create. Maybe we'll get lucky and it will be cloudy!<\/p> <p>Meetup is 1 hour before doors open. Let's meet at the second floor entrance to the World Trade Center, on the raised road that leads past the Partisans sculpture and towards BCEC. It's a pretty straightforward venue so we can probably guide late comers to the group or you can just head off on your own to photograph the costumed crowds.<\/p>",

Pretty basic, no surprises.\u00a0 The only requirement is to enjoy yourself and get a sense of how the meetups run. [This session will <i>supplement<\/i> our usual Wed evening meeting, not replace it. Sessions start promptly, so please arrive a bit early.]\u00a0 Please rsvp.<\/p> <p><b>3rd Floor, Room 097.<\/b> You must take the elevator by the security desk to access the floor.<\/p> <p><b>Parking:<\/b> If you can't find street parking, there is parking to the rear of the bldg.

Here's a description from their website:<\/p> <p><br\/>\"True to its origins, the Public Garden is a botanical showcase both for those who admire its beauty and for those who value it for information.<br\/>The first public botanical garden in America, its form, plantings, and statuary evoke its Victorian heritage. This green and flowering oasis in the heart of a great metropolis has become a Boston icon. No visit would be complete without a stroll in the Garden and a voyage on one of its Swan Boats.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>Some exceptional, not-to-miss features in the Boston Public Garden include the flower beds, tropical displays, tulips, roses and over 600 trees including the famous elms, willows and beeches.<\/p> <p>We can meet at Oak Grove at 10:00 am on the Melrose\/Malden line, and take the Orange line to Downtown crossing and walk the block to the Common, stroll through the Boston Common taking in the sights and sounds, and then head for the Public Garden and Swan Boats.\u00a0 Others may choose to meet in Boston, say at 11:00 am at the Park St. Station, or another locale.<\/p> <p>Subway: ~ $6.00 round trip (with Charley Card, a bit less)<br\/>Swan Boat ride: $2.75 for adults<br\/>$2.00 for seniors<br\/>Ice Cream or lemonade: ~$5.00<br\/>Bring your own lunch<br\/>Some may opt to bring a treat or cookies to share, but it's not necessary.<\/p> <p><br\/>We can bring small blankets to sit on or find benches, bring lunch in insulated lunch bags and\u00a0have an ice cream or other such summer treat.<\/p> <p>Can stay and shop in nearby Downtown Crossing afterwards.\u00a0 Let's hope for good weather.\u00a0\u00a0Rain cancels the event.<\/p>",

Then I will be doing that same thing to get back. I am planning on leaving from South Station at the 6:20PM time. So anyone who would like to do this with me, please let me know so I can look for you at Union Station.<\/p> <p>So our official meet time is at noon, so that is when I'll expect us all to be there. We can meet at admissions. We can also get dinner after the musuem at some place nearby. If anyone has any suggestions, comments, or questions, please let me know. Visit the website for details on things like prices: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mfa.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.mfa.org\/<\/a><\/p> <p>For anyone who has a Bank of America credit or debit card, admission should be free for you (simply show your card and ID at admissions).

It may be true that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but there are some fundamental design principles that can help you see with the eye of an artist.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/d\/b\/c\/600_327388092.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>When you travel you tend to see the world with a fresh eye. We will experiment with ways to apply this mindset to what we can photograph right here in Boston.<\/p> <p>During this workshop I will reveal 3 design principles that can make your photos more visually interesting, compelling and powerful. For example we will look at how to use asymmetrical composition to create visual balance as illustrated in the photo below.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/7\/5\/8\/600_435785976.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Photo by participant Suzanne K in Chinatown<\/p> <p>We will start in Chinatown at the Gate and do a series of short fun assignments to help you see where to stand to get the best angle on the shot and how to simplify the scene so it is interesting but not chaotic. You need to always be clear about what is the subject of the photo before you click the shutter. In this image taken by a former student, the subject is the man making the move on the game board. Everything else is organized around him. \u00a0Leaving the red sign in the upper left corner gives us vital information about the context of the image.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/e\/0\/600_435795584.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Photo by participant Dianne Ward in Chinatown<\/p> <p>In this fun and educational event, you'll discover \u00a0techniques that improve every single photo you take from now on.

Discover how to see the hidden structure of the scene. Once you see it, you can capture it in your photos. You will immediately feel the difference in your photography because they will have more impact and power.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This is a \"no technical jargon zone\", so if you're a total beginner, I promise that you will feel at ease and totally comfortable in this relaxed and fun setting. I provide individual coaching and suggestions so you will improve immediately.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Tuition for the class is $30.00. We will stay and get a bite to eat after class if you want to join us for the social part of the class. We always have a great time and look at the photos during the social time.

It doesn\u2019t just alter the space, and the sky above, but also the people who take it in. Like all great art, it is transporting. It also reflects the kind of courageous, free-spirited vision for the city that many have been longing for forever.<\/p> <p>For those interested in taking the train we will be meeting at the Oak Grove Train Station at 4:15 pm.<\/p> <p>The North End dining series is very popular.\u00a0 Please when you RSVP be sure you are planning on attending.\u00a0 RSVPs changed after 12:00 pm on Friday, July 31st will be counted as a no show.<\/p>",

His parents were both teachers. His father taught physics and his mother taught Chinese literature.

He was a research assistant at the Department of Psychology, National University, Taipei, Taiwan. In 1997 he went to University for graduate studies and was a research assistant and method\/statistics consultant at University of Minnesota Medical School from 1998 to 2005. Within that period of time, he also served as the President and on the Board of Directors, was Chair of Education and Community Development Committee, Chair of Finance Operation Committee, and Chair of Policy Committee for Chateau Student Housing Cooperative, a not-for-profit co-op providing affordable housing for students from diverse backgrounds, including US and international students.<\/p> <p><br\/>He served as Assistant Director of Outcomes Assessment at University of Maryland University College (UMUC) at Adelphi, Maryland from 2005 to 2008, where for one year he also taught Tai-Chi for stress relief as a diversity initiative. From 2008 to 2014, he was the Director of Evaluation and Assessment at the Tufts University School of Medicine, and Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine. In 2015, he accepted the position as Director of Assessment and Institutional Effectiveness at Northwestern Health Sciences University, a university aspiring to be a world-class health sciences university, that educates students, practitioners, and leaders in health and wellness solutions to help people live healthier lives.<\/p> <p><br\/>Yung-Chi is a long-term devoted educator. He has been an Adjunct Assistant Professor at UMUC since 2006, and was promoted to Adjunct Associate Professor in 2015. He is also an Associate Professor at NWHSU. He is currently developing a not-for-profit organization (YUAN3 CHIH4 EDUCATION) to promote global sharing of educational and health care resources. In his spare time he enjoys reading, writing, dreaming, dancing (recently salsa and argentine tango), and occasionally playing poker (currently no-limit Texas Hold\u2019em).<\/p>",

Each part lasts approximately 30 minutes.<\/p> <p>The Healing Service gives you the opportunity to receive healing energy that is channeled through one of our Healers. We believe that healing can be channeled through thought to those who need it. This is a very calming experience, whether or not you choose to sit in a healing chair.\u00a0 We encourage you to send healing to your loved ones, our communities, and Mother Earth.<\/p> <p>The Lecture covers a variety of topics ranging from the History of Spiritualism to Inspired Insights. It also includes examples of how Spiritualism is a part of our lives on a daily basis.<\/p> <p>Mediumship, or Spirit Communication, is the part of the service where a medium proves that \"...the existence and personal identity of the individual continue after the change called death.\" The medium might be a member of our church or visiting from another the Spiritualist church in the community. We also have mediums from abroad stop in often. While there is only enough time during a service for a few people to receive messages from their deceased loved ones on the Higher side Side of Life, everyone present benefits by witnessing proof of the continuation of life.<\/p> <p>At the conclusion of the service everyone is invited to our social hour downstairs for coffee and conversation.\ufeff<\/p>",

Those who have been in attendance will be put on an advanced track for the session.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nThis week we work on safety in landings, and precision jumping!<\/p> <p><b>What if I've never done anything like Parkour before?\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>This class, Parkour 101, is a introductory level class. We will be focusing more on learning how to move our body, understand our limits and get a solid understanding of how to train safe rather than jumping straight into super-high level flips and jumps.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What if I'm a gymnast\/marine\/stuntman\/etc? I don't want to be bored.<\/b><\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement. It's very common to in the same class have one student working on perfecting their roll, and on the other side of the room have another student practicing very high-level acrobatics. They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/b><\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous. We accept cash or card day of.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Anything else?<\/b><\/p> <p>These jams will be run outdoors, and with existing architecture. While we won't be getting into anything crazy, injuries are to be expected. Scrapes happen. We will have first aid available, but make sure you are thinking clearly and in your limits before training!\u00a0<\/p> <p>I am available to answer all questions, but I hope to see a whole bunch of you out in a few weeks!!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Be sure to check us out on:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\"><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/7\/5\/600_437965461.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>This is the new, regular meetup on Sundays at noon at Brooklyn Boulders in Somerville. \u00a0Please note that Seth will be taking over hosting this event this week. \u00a0Meet by first table\/bench thing by the entrance.<\/p> <p>(Credit to Francesco Cardiello for the information below):<br\/>BKBS is the gorgeous, new, state-of-the-art climbing gym most convenient to those in the Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville area. Although pricier, it features 60+ feet toproping and lead climbing, a massive 22 x 140 foot bouldering wall (and there's still another upstairs), yoga &amp; fitness classes, a sauna, awesome water fountains that fill your water bottle, a retail store, lounge area, weight room, and a soon to open cafe! There's even a collaborative work space where you can study, work, and climb!<br\/>If you are looking for a partner or just want to get your climb on join us on Wednesdays for a fun time.<\/p> <p>FAQ:<\/p> <p>How do I get there? BKBS is conveniently located within a 10 minute walk of the Porter Square station. Walk down Somerville Avenue and turn right on Properzi way and head all the way down. It is also very bike accessible. If you drive, you can find the lot at 30 Dane St. It is located next to Artisans Asylum.<\/p> <p>Why should I do this meetup? Since BKBS is such a new community (opened in late July 2013) few people have developed regular climbing partners to train and climb with. This is a great opportunity to meet other climbers interested in BKBS. Climbing is an inherently social sport - to top rope and do lead, you need to meet people who are dedicated to climbing. The Wednesday meetup assures you'll meet a partner to regularly climb with. We are looking to expand to other nights in the future.<\/p> <p>What if I haven't climbed before? First off, don't be intimidated. Everyone started somewhere. If you have never belayed before, please make sure to take the Learn the Ropes class. More info can be found here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/<\/a>. If you have a working knowledge of how to belay, you will need to be belay certified before using the walls. Please flag down a BKBS employee and let them know you need to take a belay test. To pass such a test you will need to display how to tie a double figure eight knot with a fisherman's backup, safely belay a climber up a wall, catch them on a fall, and lower them to the ground safely.<\/p> <p>What equipment do I need? You will need at the bare minimum a harness and climbing shoes. Rentals are available. Grigri devices are provided at every station.<\/p> <p>What if I can come, but at a different time? Just let everyone know you want to climb at a different time and use the community to find a partner for those dates \/ times.<\/p> <p>These are the climbing rates:<\/p> <p>ADMISSION (Full day use, you can leave and come back!): Day Pass - $22 (Students $18)<br\/>10 Pack - $200 (Students $169)<\/p> <p>RENTALS: Shoes - $5<br\/>Harness - $5<br\/>Chalk Bag - $2<br\/>Full Gear Kit - $11<\/p>",

The Sculpture Park occupies the entire campus: 30 acres of beautifully landscaped lawns, forests, fields, gardens, and terraces on a rolling site along the shore of Flint\u2019s Pond in Lincoln, Massachusetts.\"<\/p> <p>It is a beautiful space with lawns for running (and tiring those kids out!), trees for climbing, sculptures that you can interact with, and much more! It is also a great place for a picnic if you want to arrive early.<\/p> <p>Adult admission is $14, but kids 12 and under are free!

I'd also like to coordinate people bringing picnic items. I will bring wine and plastic cups, picnic-ware, and napkins; do I have volunteers to bring cheese\/crackers, fruit, dessert items? When you RSVP, please make a note of what you plan to bring.<\/p> <p><b>Directions from the South: <\/b> Rt. 1 North to MA-128 North exit 20A and travel on Rte 1A North for about 4 miles, the polo grounds will be on your right.<\/p> <p><b>Directions from the North:<\/b> Rt. 1 South to MA-128 South exit 20A and travel on Rte 1A South for about 4 miles, the polo grounds will be on your left.<\/p> <p><b>Directions to 435 Bay Road: <\/b>Walking distance from the commuter rail Newburyport\/Rockport Line Hamilton\/Wenham Station!<\/p> <p><b>RAIN DATE: <\/b>Sunday, August 9, 2015<\/p> <p>For more information, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myopiapolo.org\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.myopiapolo.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.myopiapolo.org<\/a><\/a>.<\/p>",

At 5:00 we will circle up for our ritual time, which will include breathing, guided meditation, chanting, drumming, and walking by the edge of the ocean. We will end by blessing and sharing a ritual loaf of Lammas bread before our potluck feast.<\/p> <p>This year, we will be meeting at a slightly different area of the beach, close to one of the bathhouses. You'll find us near Pavilions 1 and 2, between Beach Street and Shirley Avenue, and directly opposite the Revere Beach T stop. Parking may be available on Revere Beach Boulevard, or you may need to circle around to the parallel street, which is Ocean Avenue.<\/p> <p>Please RVSP to [masked] so that we know how many women to expect. We'll meet rain or shine. If it's raining, we'll be in Pavilion 1 or 2.

There's Tavern in the Square! If you're driving, you can park on the street for free on Sundays!<\/p> <p>Anyone who loves ASL is welcome to come and be part of the fun! We want to warmly extend an invitation to Deaf people or others fluent\/skilled in the language (CODAs for example) to join our group.<\/p> <p>This is an easy-going, casual, ASL get-together to meet people who enjoy American Sign Language, who want to brush up on their signing skills, and want to learn more ASL by using it as often as possible.<\/p> <p>We strive to have a good time and communicate without using voices. If we need to, we draw or write what we don't know how to sign, and if lots of folks show up, we split up into small groups and mix and mingle, so we can actually see one another clearly, face-to-face and get a good conversation going.<\/p> <p>Don't be afraid or shy if you're not \"perfect\" at ASL, because being \"perfect\" is not the point of this group. No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.<\/p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again. This isn't an ASL class, since none of us are certified ASL teachers, so there's really <i>no<\/i> pressure or expectation--other than that we all use ASL to communicate. We all learn from one another!<\/p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL\/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language<\/i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs<\/i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!<\/p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged<\/i><\/b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating. We have lots of resources that we can suggest for learning ASL from a qualified teacher or authentic source, such as books, online classes, and local classes at various locations near Boston.<\/p> <p>If you can, \"officially\" RSVP, even if the RSVP is \"No,\" so that we know who is definitely going to come.<\/p> <p>It will be great to see folks!<\/p> <p>Erika and Jack<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This is an ongoing weekly (donation only) class for anyone, offering experiential practice in meditation, along with an opportunity to be among others interested in deepening spiritutual practices. \u00a0The class provides you with a felt sense of your own divinity; your Higher Self. The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening. Bringing the flow of light into the body\/mind\/heart means we more consciously embody our Light Being, so we are more present, happy, forgiving, peaceful and joyful while in the world.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0After the guided portion we\u00a0spend time\u00a0in peaceful silence.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you are an experienced meditator or a beginner, you will love the sweetness and powerful energies of this group. At the end of the class we make time for questions or sharing. \u00a0Group meditation is powerful, and it's refreshing to be among fellow travelers!<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0Judy also teaches the Sound and Light meditation; a way for you to draw your senses inward to open your spiritual eye and to hear the sounds of your chakras.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0This practice is non-denominational, appropriate for anyone.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0Held in a lovely healing space, just walking in will bring you instant peace.\u00a0 All are welcome.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0 You may also want to check out my other Meetup, for a variety of spiritual programs: \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings<\/a><\/a>\/<\/p>",

Frequently, 20-25 walkers turn out for this walk, and you can too. There are a whole bunch of regulars, along with some new people.<\/p> <p><br\/>Frequently, if we eat too much food, we'll go for another walk.<\/p> <p>Come see why this walk is so popular. It's at a great time, the people are friendly, the parking is free -- no permit parking in Cambridge on Sunday, so you can park on Huron or Aberdeen Ave.<\/p> <p>You can get there by T easily from Harvard Square, take the 71 OR 73 bus to Aberdeen Ave, then walk to the other end of Aberdeen Ave, and you'll see us there.<\/p> <p>If you're late, and we've already started, start walking counter-clockwise. We'll be walking clockwise, so we'll surely bump into each other. We're the large group of vigorously chatting walkers.<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there.<\/p> <p>We'll all go out for dinner afterwards, somewhere in the neighborhood.<\/p>",

It's at a great time, the people are friendly, the parking is free -- no permit parking in Cambridge on Sunday, so you can park on Huron or Aberdeen Ave.<\/p> <p>You can get there by T easily from Harvard Square, take the 71 OR 73 bus to Aberdeen Ave, then walk to the other end of Aberdeen Ave, and you'll see us there. We'll be next to the bridge, on the pond side of Huron Ave,at the intersection of Aberdeen Ave.<\/p> <p>If you're late, and we've already started, start walking counter-clockwise. We'll be walking clockwise, so we'll surely bump into each other. We're the large group of vigorously chatting walkers.<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there.<\/p> <p>Shangri La is located at 149 Belmont Street, Belmont - please let the host know if you're coming, so we can get the right sized table.<\/p>",

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

This August, we plan to go back to a topic that we\u2019ve done before, but that always captures attention: tech toys.<\/p> <p>One of the challenges that consultants and solo professionals face is the need to be their own IT departments. It can be hard enough to keep up with necessary hardware and software updates for the technology you\u2019re already using. It can be even harder to keep an eye peeled for the next new thing.<\/p> <p>But SPC is here to help. Our panel, moderated by Steve Balzac, the Society\u2019s immediate past president, will include Bob Goodearl of RGood Software Inc., and Rick Pollak, The Presentation Medic, as well as other tech gurus. They will present a selection of new (or maybe new-to-you) devices, accessories, programs, and apps that can help you work more efficiently, and make work more fun.<\/p> <p>We expect this session to be even more interactive than usual. If you\u2019ve got a favorite gadget or program that\u2019s made a big difference in your work life, come prepared to share.<\/p> <p>So pack up your kit and join us! Dress for this event will be casual, and weather permitting, we\u2019ll be outdoors. The cost is $50 for members and first time attendees. All others are $55. Late registration for members is $60 and $65 for all others.<\/p> <p>Please remember to pay for the meeting online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spconsultants.org\/event-1821158\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.spconsultants.org\/event-1821158<\/a> or bring a cash or check to the event.<\/p>",

Despite Marty vehemently denying it - those \"10 people\" really can make a difference!<\/p> <p>There are many other ways to get involved as well. We will be discussing current and upcoming issues, events, and how to get involved. We are also looking for members to share \u00a0their own stories and ideas. \u00a0<\/p> <p>We will be making some announcements about several exciting events. There are at three (and potentially more) nationally known speakers this fall. Plus there are several areas of activism coming up where we need to be involved.<\/p> <p><br\/>We can turn back the tide of creeping government intrusion into our lives - come join us to discuss how!<\/p> <p>----------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Traditional Boston Meeting notes:<\/p> <p>We will again have a social hour at 6:30 pm and have the meeting begin at 7:30 pm.<\/p> <p>Parking \u2013 from Parkopedia.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>This summer series of Irish set dancing classes is for beginners who want to learn the basic movements of set dancing while getting a feeling of accomplishment by dancing whole sets through from beginning to end each night. These are good refresher classes for fairly-new dancers, as well, or \"improvers\" who want to get more familiar with the various sets.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We welcome more experienced dancers to join in the classes, as well, but the focus is on teaching beginners; in fact, it really helps the new dancers enjoy the classes more when they\u00a0have a partner who knows the steps already. We all love sharing what we know and there is great satisfaction in helping newbies learn set dancing.<\/p> <p>We teach basic footwork and movements to specific sets during the 8 weeks of classes. We teach one set per night, figure by figure, then dance the whole set at the end of the night. By the end of the series of classes, the new dancer should have enough experience and confidence to join in any set dancing group and start to really enjoy the social and physical benefits of Irish set dancing.\u00a0<\/p> <p>No partner is needed. Leather-soled shoes are recommended, or shoes that don't stick (most sneakers will stick), as set dancing has a lot of gliding movements. Wear comfortable clothes (think cotton t-shirts and loose pants).<\/p> <p>The cost is $8.00 per class* - pay as you go - no need to sign up for the whole series.\u00a0[*$7 per class for Harrington's regular set dancers]\u00a0<\/p> <p>Frank and Eileen have been enthusiastically teaching beginner summer classes for several years and will continue to teach the classes, but we also have special guest teachers this summer.\u00a0<\/p>",

The silent sitting is interspersed with some meditation instruction, perhaps a brief reading, a little simple inquiry, exploration or movement. Sitting posture is relaxed, either on a meditation cushion or a bench. It's not a rigid practice- move whenever you need to!<\/p> <p>We meet every Monday night, 7:30 pm at the Cambridge Friends Meeting House. The Friends Meeting House is located at 5 Longfellow Park, Cambridge, MA 02138 You can find a very good map here:\u00a0&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.fmcquaker.org\/FMC-Map_2006.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/fmcquaker.org\/about-friends-meeting-at-cambridge\/directions\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/fmcquaker.org\/about-friends-meeting-at-cambridge\/directions\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Parking is available after 6:00 in the loop off of Brattle St. that leads to the Friend's House, and there is a small lot in back of the Friend's House for those with limited mobility. After that, parking is a little tricky in Cambridge (lots of \"resident only\" signs), but you will find available parking on Mount Auburn St. near Friend's House and on Brattle St. as you head away from Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>Coming by the T is a great option, with the Friend's House being a lovely 15 minute walk out of Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>If you find you are running late, come anyway! The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

I am White. If nothing else it starts a conversation with other White people about what is race and racial identity. I focus on reaching out to White people to confront racism because that's where the main problem hides. Us White folks are very resistant to dealing with race and racism, as Dr. Robin DiAngelo points out in an essay on &lt;a&gt;The Pernicious Impact of 'White Fragility&lt;\/a&gt;.' The same holds true for systems of oppression based on gender and class.\"<\/p> <p>More info about the discussion is <a href=\"http:\/\/myemail.constantcontact.com\/White-Nationalism--White-Supremacy--and-White-Privilege.html?soid=1101202874861&amp;aid=z9b89itpDjU\">here<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Accessibility Information:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.communitychangeinc.org\/Library\">Pappenheim Library<\/a>\u00a0at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.communitychangeinc.org\/\">Community Change, Inc.<\/a>\u00a0is wheelchair accessible with the following limitations.\u00a0 The door to the building is heavy and does not have a button to open it.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

We'll be at M.J. O'Connor's (the Park Plaza location). They are reserving their entire 150 person back room exclusively for us! I'll bring some board games along.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>More about M.J. O'Connor's here: <a href=\"http:\/\/back-bay.mjoconnors.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/back-bay.mjoconnors.com\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Please keep in mind that there are a couple of M.J. O'Connor locations, we'll be at the <a href=\"http:\/\/back-bay.mjoconnors.com\/contact\">Park Plaza location<\/a> at 27 Columbus Ave. in Boston<\/p> <p>LOGISTICS:<\/p> <p>* There is no theme or agenda, just people talking about Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and geeky things that we like (and dislike). If you can't come on time, that's fine, we usually have a large group until 8:00 PM. M.J. O'Connors is open until 2am if you want to stay extra late, but they will open up the room to the public at 9:00pm.<\/p> <p>* If you have SciFi\/Fantasy Books or DVDs that you don't want anymore, feel free to bring them to the meetup and give them away (no sales, please). Be sure to take home anything that isn't claimed before you leave!<\/p> <p>* There is no charge for this meetup, but the restaurant that hosts us greatly appreciates your business (and doesn't charge us a room rental fee), so please come hungry (or at least buy a drink). Also, please don't forget to pay your bill before you leave!<\/p> <p><br\/>TRAVEL:<\/p> <p>It's about a 5-10 minute walk from the Park Street T stop (Red and green) and a five minute walk from either Arlington and the Boylston stops on the green line<\/p> <p>There are pay parking lots around. For example, the\u00a0Motor Mart Garage (motormartgarage.com) which is just around the block and is $10 for up to 3 hours, if you come in after 5pm.<\/p> <p>Here is a <a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=27+Columbus+Ave.+Boston,+MA+02116&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=42.351088,-71.068792&amp;sspn=0.009753,0.020278&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=27+Columbus+Ave,+Boston,+Massachusetts+02116&amp;t=m&amp;z=16\">map to the location<\/a>.<\/p> <p>There are some metered parking spots for the those willing to drive around and be patient, but only a few.<\/p>",

We describe the work we have done so far to build a warehouse for performance analysis, letting us separate visualization and reporting from collection and normalization, while providing a foundation for applying machine learning techniques. We'll walk through how we collect and normalize Telemetry data into ElasticSearch, along with Log data, and then how we collect and normalize configuration data. \u00a0We show some of our work to enable Grafana to visualize the telemetry data, and demonstrate a performance analysis tool, pbench, which wraps benchmarks runs indexing them as discrete results sets, enabling a flexible web UI for visualization and reporting (nvd3 based).<\/p> <p>This work is in its very early stages, so there will be lots of duct tape, band-aids, paper-clips, chewing gum, and bees-wax used to keep it all together. :)<\/p> <p><i><b>Speaker<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>Peter Portante is a\u00a0Software Engineer at Red Hat.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Kubernetes: What, Why, and How with ELK<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>We will discuss what Kubernetes is, and is not, compared to previous deployment systems on physical\/virtual machines, Ansible, and OpenStack and explain why Kubernetes is different.To understand how Kubernetes works, we will deploy ELK in a Pod to showcase some of the features Kubernetes provides.<\/p> <p><br\/><b><i>Speaker<\/i><\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Learnaholic, passionate about Distributed Systems and uptime, Myles Steinhauser is currently focused on ELK, Elixir, Containers and OpenStack.<\/p>",

Today, in response to huge community interest and to draw diverse Boston residents into the park, the Franklin Park Coalition has revived the Playhouse. For the last seven years, the City of Boston's portable ParkARTS stage has been brought to the park for concerts, theatre, and dance performances. This ambitious summer arts series has been possible with the involvement of experienced partners: the National Center of Afro-American Artists, First Night Boston's Summer Beat, and ParkARTS. You can look forward to summer concerts every Tuesday morning and evening throughout July and August. Morning shows target summer camps and youth programs but also bring elder groups to the park. All are invited to bring a picnic lunch and stay for the day. FPC's Summer Youth Crew members help direct groups to the site, show them a picnic spot, and can be available to play games or lead a walk in the woods after the show. Evening concerts are for everyone. Families bring a picnic basket and lawn chairs. Neighbors and friends make it a social evening. Performers are local favorites like Ray Greene, Fulani Haynes, Andre Ward, and Valerie Stephens. Playhouse Revival Elma Lewis was adamant that if the performance area is revitalized in her name, it must follow the artistic vision and standards of the original Playhouse in the Park. Ms. Lewis worked tirelessly to ensure that African-American children and community members receive disciplined, skilled artistic training and exposure to the most talented musicians and performers of the day. To carry on in her footsteps, Playhouse in the Park has been re-established as an exciting summer venue for multi-cultural performances. The first summers included gospel concerts, Commonwealth Shakespeare\u2019s A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, children\u2019s performances for summer camp groups, and theatre workshops for youth directed by Our Place Theatre in Roxbury. The Playhouse in the Park is a cultural partnership between the Franklin Park Coalition, the National Center of Afro-American Artists, and the Boston Parks &amp; Recreation Department. First Night Boston's Summer Beat produces the summer season, which includes five or more Tuesdays with a morning children's event and an evening show for everyone. The 2009 Playhouse summer season was made possible with generous support from ParkARTS, the Boston Foundation, and an anonymous donor and many individual contributors to the Franklin Park Coalition. An exciting 2010 season with daytime and evening Tuesday performances is planned. Today, a playhouse stage is brought in for performances and set up near the Overlook ruins. The Coalition would like to return the Playhouse stage to the scenic ruins Miss Lewis used. Summer arts programming, combined with masonry and landscape restoration, will revive this long-neglected area of the park. Elma Lewis was a cultural icon in Boston's black community until her death in January 2004. She was the founder and director of The Elma Lewis School for Fine and Performing Arts in the 1950s, where thousands of African American children and adults studied until it closed in the 1980s. Miss Lewis, who helped start the Franklin Park Coalition, sought to make the park a community gathering place after years of neglect. Miss Lewis and a group of students cleaned up the rat-infested, garbage-strewn area where Olmsted's Overlook Shelter had burned. They built the Playhouse stage amidst the stone ruins and set up chairs. Thus began a summer concert series that took place every night from July 4th to Labor Day for twelve years. Local performers and national stars graced the Playhouse stage, offering drama, dance, music and poetry, all of the high caliber that Miss Lewis demanded. From Duke Ellington's 4th of July concerts to Olatunji and his African drums closing the season on Labor Day, from Billy Taylor and Odetta to the Boston Ballet, people in Boston were exposed to premier arts.<\/p>",

Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/i><\/p>",

Skip it if you would rather just wing it and meet us at the track. We'll fill you in there.<\/p> <p>If you have never run on a track before, don't worry if none of this makes sense right now. As much as I will try to prep you, it usually just takes a few laps around the track for all of this to sink in.<\/p> <p><b>The Workout<\/b><\/p> <p>The workouts vary on a weekly basis and are usually interval based. We sometimes do workouts that are fun and different. Come see what this weeks workout is!<\/p> <p><b>What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>1. The distances (200, 400, 800, etc.) are the distances we run on the track. Each lap around the track is 400 meters.<\/p> <p>2. Each lap is supposed to be run at a certain speed, based on your 5k pace. Don't know what your 5k pace is? Read my instructions below to calculate your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>*3. The recovery interval (RI), which is indicated in parentheses, may be a specified timed interval or a distance that you walk\/jog.<\/p> <p><b>Things to remember<\/b><\/p> <p>Track workouts are supposed to be FUN! Don't be intimidated or dread a track workout. This is supposed to be a fun supplement to your other \"normal\" runs. With all of us out there encouraging each other it should be a blast.<\/p> <p>Bring a running stopwatch\/wristwatch if you have one! Using the start\/lap\/stop function will help you pace yourself on each lap.<\/p> <p>Don't push it! If something hurts or starts to feel tight, don't risk an injury because you ran too hard on your first track workout of the summer. We have plenty of time to ease in...<\/p> <p>Bring water for the end!!!<\/p> <p><b>5k pace instructions<\/b><\/p> <p>Decide how fast you would like to run a 5k. Choose a time that is reasonable yet challenging. Convert that time to seconds, and divide the seconds by 12.5 (the number of 400 meter laps it takes to run 5k). That is your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>As an example, I might decide a reasonable yet challenging goal time for a 5k is 24 minutes.<\/p> <p>24 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 1440 seconds<\/p> <p>1440 seconds divided by 12.5 laps in a 5k ~= 115 seconds \/ lap<\/p> <p>This means that I will run the workout according to a pace of 115 seconds \/ lap.<\/p> <p>I will also have pacing charts available at the track, so don't fret.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.informalrunning.com\/category\/blog\/\">Blog<\/a><\/b><\/p>",

The trading deadline\u00a0will have passed on July 31\u00a0and we will be sorting out all of the moves made and\u00a0not made by the Red Sox and the competition.\u00a0Seven years ago the event was quite lively as we celebrated the departure of Manny and the arrival of Jason Bay with a shot of Johnny Walker Red! Last year was the fire sale edition.<\/p> <p>Natives Team Weatherman Scott says it will probably be a hazy, hot and humid night so we will venture outside to watch the Sox game at Legal Seafoods out door bar and patio at the Charles Hotel in Harvard Square. This is the raw bar at street level visible from the street, not the patio dining area in the courtyard. There are several Televisions at the bar. The bar menu is sufficient for most people. The Red Sox play the\u00a0New York Yankees\u00a0at 7:00pm and we will watch the game.<\/p> <p>We will be either at or around the bar and then move to a round table. Ask the bartenders if you can not find us or are a newbie. All members should wear Red Sox Baseball hats.<\/p> <p>Attendance at this is unlimited. Please RSVP and bring guests and other Sox fans. Come meet other members who share your interest, provide feedback on desired events and cheer on our Sox.<\/p> <p>Please remember to maintain your own tab or pay cash for your beverage and food and tip your server\/bartender when paying your separate food and drink check before leaving. However, if you sit at a group table a group bill may be provided so please communicate with your server when ordering.<\/p> <p>Go Sox<\/p> <p>Fenway Frank and Jon<\/p>",

I thought it would be fun to have an early dinner and drinks beforehand at Margarita's restaurant across the street. Feel free to join the movie, the dinner, or both! Hope to see you :)<\/i><\/p> <p>This movie looks hilarious!!<\/p> <p>\" Filmmaker Judd Apatow (The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, This Is 40) directs Trainwreck, starring and written by breakout comedic actress Amy Schumer (\u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d). Since she was a little girl, it\u2019s been drilled into Amy\u2019s head by her rascal of a dad (Colin Quinn) that monogamy isn\u2019t realistic. Now a magazine writer, Amy lives by that credo\u2014enjoying what she feels is an uninhibited life free from stifling, boring romantic commitment\u2014but in actuality, she\u2019s kind of in a rut. When she finds herself starting to fall for the subject of the new article she\u2019s writing, a charming and successful sports doctor named Aaron (Bill Hader), Amy starts to wonder if other grown-ups, including this guy who really seems to like her, might be on to something. The comedy Trainwreck also stars Brie Larson, John Cena, Tilda Swinton and LeBron James.\"<\/p> <p>See the trailer here:<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/y_KP9x80Z9Q\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/y_KP9x80Z9Q<\/a><\/p> <p>I haven't set a date yet - it's being released this Friday.

        "description": "<p>The Yoga of Equal Taste teaches that, while life seems to be a series of ups and downs, joys and sorrows, highs and lows, there is a thread of deep continuity running through it. In other words, joy and sorrow, rather than being entirely different, have an element of equal taste. To find that place of equal taste is part of the path of spiritual maturity. It is not to \u201cflat line\u201d all our diverse experiences, but to discover stability and groundedness within them. In this evening teaching, we will explore the Yoga of Equal taste, as it relates to our meditation practice and to life.<\/p> <p>Please join us for a session of natural meditation in the Tibetan Buddhist traditions of Dzogchen and Mahamudra.

        "description": "<p>NUTSHELL - every week\u00a0day, 12:15ish until 1:45ish,\u00a0Cumnock Turf Fields\u00a0at Harvard Stadium, games of 4v4 up to 10v10 or larger depending on who shows, bring a white shirt and a dark\/colored shirt (but not a gray one), almost never canceled, read\u00a0below for more details before asking questions that are answered here, and read the comments for today's meetup to see if there is\u00a0anything important\u00a0about today.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\"><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT - Harvard Square is the closest T stop (red line). \u00a0Check Google Maps or other to find fastest way there from wherever you are.<\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY RIDE SHARE - a lot of players in this meetup come by car and are nice enough to offer rides to others. Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Commonwealth Shakespeare Company's 20th season of free Shakespeare on Boston Common will present King Lear\u00a0for the very first time.<\/p> <p>King Lear\u00a0follows the journey of an aging king, faced with his own mortality and mental decline, who tries to secure the legacy of his kingdom by dividing it amongst his three daughters. Only through loss--of status, of love, of loyalty--does King Lear learn what is truly resonant at the end of a life.<\/p> <p>\u201cKing Lear is one of Shakespeare\u2019s monumental plays,\u201d says Steven Maler, CSC's Founding Artistic Director. \u201cThere\u2019s good reason I\u2019ve waited 20 years to take it on. As with the greatest of Shakespeare\u2019s history plays, Lear blends the political and the personal, interweaving a country\u2019s destiny with the very human frailties of those charged with shepherding its future. The play reveals what it means to be human--our responsibilities to ourselves, our family and our fellow human beings--as well as true loyalty and loyalty as pretense for deceit, and the struggles in times of succession and transition that are as resonant today as they were four hundred years ago.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/commshakes.org\/performances\/performance\/97\"><a href=\"http:\/\/commshakes.org\/performances\/performance\/97\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/commshakes.org\/performances\/performance\/97<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/commshakes.org\/about\/faq#Parking\"><a href=\"http:\/\/commshakes.org\/about\/faq\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/commshakes.org\/about\/faq<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>You are welcome to bring a blanket and or short beach\/lawn chair and food though there will be food trucks at the site and you can rent a lawn chair for $5 on either side of the stage. \u00a0<\/p> <p>We will meet early so as to secure a good viewing area for our party and because many people stake out their spot 2-3 hours early. \u00a0<\/p> <p>At 7 pm, an hour before the performance begins, there will be a Greenshow featuring\u00a0actors from its\u00a0CSC's apprentice training program. The Greenshow is a lively and fun prelude to an evening's performance, meant to prepare the audience for the main stage event--and runs\u00a0approximately 30 minutes.<\/p>",

Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that MTG Boston members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p>",

How often do we get an opportunity to be real with each other in Boston?<\/p> <p>At TurnON, we play three communication games, and you can participate at whatever level feels good to you. Imagine meeting new people in an environment where they feel comfortable to be themselves; a refreshing change from the typical networking or bar conversation. That's what we have created. \nTurnON events give you the opportunity to look deeper into yourself, through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses. What comes up might surprise you! \nIt's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to be authentic. It's like a giant exhale when the rest of the world is asking you to hold it in. In just an hour, you may even forget that you are in Boston.\n<\/p> <p>TurnON Boston is an organization that teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM. At the end of the evening, we will give you a brief description of the practice of Orgasmic Meditation and information on where to learn more. The games we play at TurnON events are designed to create the visceral sensation of Orgasm\/OM in your body, without actually doing the practice (or touching anyone, or removing any clothing!). ** We start on time, so please arrive by 7:20.**<\/p> <p>$10, payable at the door.<\/p>",

Join acclaimed yoga instructor David Magone as he pushes the boundaries of yoga into the world of rave lights and electronic music.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nOn August 5, OBERON is transforming into a rave yoga studio. The evening starts with David leading a 90 minute thigh-scorching sequence of standing postures, light-as-air backbends, deep hip opening practices, and guided meditations. After class, stick around for special performances, drinks at the bar, and an open dance floor with a live DJ. If you're looking for this summer's hottest evening activity, look no further.

Likewise, if you're planning on arriving more than a half-hour late, you should be aware that it may not be possible to include you in a game. You're welcome to come by and hang out but the chances are better than even that we'll be hip-deep in gaming goodness by the time you arrive.<\/p> <p>* Please be respectful of our hosts; stay mindful of closing time and throw 'em some business if you're hungry.<\/p> <p>* Have fun and roll high!<\/p>",

La Qchara is closer to the Wakefield border, and because it is so small I'm limiting the RSVP's to 6. I'm planning to call a few days in advance to make sure they can accomodate; they are open Wednesdays until 8:30 PM.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Funny story, they told me about their new restaurant when I went into Coffee, Tea, and Me, and I googled it and googled it and googled it but I couldn't find it. Ends up I was using the actual Spanish spelling, La Cuchara (the word for spoon) and didn't get the literal \u00a0Q business of how they chose to name their restaurant. So of course I never found it on google. \u00a0<\/p> <p>I might be able to get there by 7:00, but because it is tight I'm saying I'll be there by 7:15. Hold a table if you get there before I do. As always, I've got bananagrams if people want to linger.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As usual, please don't RSVP and then don't come. I don't want to play bananagrams all by myself, nor munch of my share of yucca fries and fish tacos while staring at some empty chairs, and it kind of sucks when people just don't show up. If you can't come I just ask that you un RSVP yourself before the dinner starts, preferably earlier, and I won't count you as a NO SHOW.\u00a0<\/p> <p>...because you wouldn't want to deny someone else the experience of Central\/ South American food.\u00a0<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Join 50 to 80 or 100 dancers any Wednesday at Dance Freedom!!<\/p> <p>We are the original barefoot weekly dance, continuously running for 44 years, that has spawned hundreds if not thousands of other dances around the world.<\/p> <p>In a drug, alcohol, and shoe-free environment, we've been making friends and sharing safe and juicy dances for decades. Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome! For more information, E-mail: [masked]<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>The Public Open Night at the Observatory is a chance for people to come observe the night sky through telescopes and binoculars and see things they otherwise might not get to see, and learn some astronomy as well. The Open Nights are held most Wednesday evenings throughout the year, weather permitting.<\/p> <p>It is open to everyone. Starting times are 7:30pm during the fall and winter, and 8:30pm during the spring and summer. The program lasts about an hour.<\/p> <p>Weather<\/p> <p>The weather is always a factor when observing. Unfortunately we can\u2019t control the weather and we can\u2019t observe when there are clouds, haze, or rain; so when the weather is bad, the Open Night will be canceled. Predicting the weather in New England isn\u2019t easy, so we won\u2019t know if the Open Night will be held or not until the day of the program. To find out if the Open Night will be held, call our information number at[masked], no earlier than two hours before the scheduled starting time. This lets us make the decision as late as possible while still giving those who live farther away time to get here.<\/p> <p>Remember, it gets very cold in Boston in the winter and the telescopes are outside, so dress warmly.<\/p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Tickets &lt;&lt;&lt;<\/p> <p>Public Open Nights are open to everyone, however space is limited.

        "description": "<p>Come and join us for an evening of fun and shared energy. How often do we get an opportunity to be real with each other in Boston?<\/p> <p>At TurnON, we play three communication games, and you can participate at whatever level feels good to you. Imagine meeting new people in an environment where they feel comfortable to be themselves; a refreshing change from the typical networking or bar conversation. That's what we have created.<\/p> <p>TurnON events give you the opportunity to look deeper into yourself, through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses. What comes up might surprise you!It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to be authentic. It's like a giant exhale when the rest of the world is asking you to hold it in.<\/p> <p>In just an hour, you may even forget that you are in Boston.<\/p> <p>TurnON Boston is an organization that teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM. At the end of the evening, we will give you a brief description of the practice of Orgasmic Meditation and information on where to learn more.<\/p> <p>The games we play at TurnON events are designed to create the visceral sensation of Orgasm\/OM in your body, without actually doing the practice (or touching anyone, or removing any clothing!).<\/p> <p>** We start on time, so please arrive by 7:20.**<\/p> <p>$10, payable at the door.<\/p>",

Tonight's guest will be James Morcan, and we will discuss some the the 29 conspiracies covered in the non-fictional <i>The Orphan Conspiracies<\/i>, as well as other aspects of James' extremely interesting career. James is an actor\/writer\/producer and--accordingly--much of his work is expressed in both books and film.<\/p> <p>From Amazon.com:<\/p> <p>Garnering evidence from court cases, declassified government files and mainstream media reports, the authors disclose little-known facts on a wide range of topics. Diverse subjects such as mind control, eugenics, false flag operations, The Queen's hidden assets, secret prisons, The Catcher in the Rye enigma, political assassinations, medical cover-ups, genius learning techniques, Yamashita's Gold, the Jonestown mystery, Americanized Nazis, the bankrupting of Third World nations, underground bases, the US Federal Reserve, the New World Order, forbidden science, the War on Drugs, subliminal messages and even extraterrestrials\u2026.<\/p> <p>Written from multiple perspectives; at times giving voice to conspiracy theorists; on other occasions siding with sceptics; vacillating between serious investigative writing and tongue-in-cheek, self-deprecating humor - <i>The Orphan Conspiracies<\/i> delivers a balanced expos\u00e9 of some of the most important issues of our time.<\/p> <p><br\/>In their unflinching quest for truth and justice, the Morcans take no prisoners as they 'subpoena' the global elite - be they banksters, US Presidents, British Royals, Big Pharma, the Vatican, the FBI, the CIA, the Military Industrial Complex or the founders and CEO's of multinational corporations like Facebook, Shell, Google, BP and Microsoft. No suspicious individual or organization is granted immunity in this no-holds-barred trial conducted on behalf of The People...\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\"I expect readers of this book will be surprised by the level of knowledge imparted in its pages, especially with its revelations of exotic technologies, financial injustices, political deceptions and suppressed scientific discoveries. I also expect readers will be inspired by the lifting of the veil that occurs when long-guarded information is absorbed.\"\u00a0 -- Dr. Takaaki Musha, from the Foreword to <i>The Orphan Conspiracies<\/i>\u00a0 (read\u00a0 the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Orphan-Conspiracies-Conspiracy-Theories-Trilogy-ebook\/dp\/B00J4MPFT6\/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436815555&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=orphan+conspiracies\">complete text<\/a> on Amazon)<\/p> <p>New Zealand-born James Morcan resides in Sydney, Australia.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

Azure Mobile Services is a quick and easy way to provide data storage (accessible through REST API calls), Push Notifications, and authentication with Microsoft Accounts. All of this functionality works on each of the top Mobile Platforms!. We will take a look at the Azure portal as well as the tooling built into Visual Studio giving you, the developer, a couple of different options for setting up your backend and quickly putting you on your way to making your first cross platform mobile app!

We will be meeting in one of their conference rooms and there are spots for 12 people. <b><i>We are requiring $10 to register, which will be refunded when you arrive. (the purpose of the $10 is to ensure you aren't flaky because there are many people that end up on the waiting list!)<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Please let us know if you're interested in having us host this Meetup again, we're happy to! \u00a0<\/p>",

No, we're thrilled to be partnering again with our friends from Formlabs! We've co-hosted meetups together in the past, but this time Formlabs will open their impressive headquarters for us all.<\/b><\/p> <p>We know a lot of creative makers and members of makerspaces will be in Boston to attend FAB11 and we hope to give a good addition to the event schedule.<\/p> <p><br\/>Shapeways Community Manager Andrew will give a small presentation about our recently released CustomMaker, also our IP Counsel Michael will be there. Rumour has it that a lot of the Formlabs staff will stick around after work, so expect it's going to be busy! Make sure to RSVP so we know to expect you.<\/p> <p>If you've made products via Shapeways or with a Formlabs printer, be sure to bring your 3D Prints and share the story behind them!\u00a0<\/p>",

Ameeta Kaul is Awake and offers satsang once a month at this location. She is very good at bridging people into their own Truth. Her spiritual teacher is Adyashanti, who is also one of my spiritual teachers. If you are not yet Awake, spending time with people who are will help ripen you for Awakening, and if you are Awake it helps you to embody and deepen your Awakeness.<\/p> <p>Suggested Donation $20<\/p> <p>Ameeta's description of the event:<\/p> <p>\"Although the overall theme continues to be Responding to the Call of Truth within, this month's satsang will be dedicated to what seems to be both, a deep yearning, and a living exploration - to be in the world and not of it. At a certain point in the journey perhaps it is seen that this is indeed what we are being called to - to be in the world and not of it. This call is like a guiding star, providing direction to what unfolds in our lives, and yet also presenting many challenges in the reality of its living!<\/p> <p>\"If this call resonates inside you, a little or a lot, then come join me in satsang. Together let us explore what it means to be in the world and not of it, in earthly activity, in human relationships, and in this life.\u00a0 Together let us allow the radiance of this call to help us drop our fears and hesitations, and dive deep into the ocean of truth, for in this endeavor we are helped by all who have gone before us, and who shine the light to illuminate our path.<\/p> <p>\"Satsang will officially begin at 6:45 pm and go up to 8:45 pm. I will be available from 6 pm itself for anybody who wishes to sit or dialogue with me, before the official session.This will not be a private session, but will be in the presence of all who may be\u00a0 assembled at that time.<\/p> <p>\"I really look forward to meeting each one who participates.

What does it mean to those who write? Born from the interplay of natural and cultural history, the seemingly magical act of writing has continually expanded our consciousness. Portrayed in mythology as either a gift from heroes or a curse from the gods, it has been used as both an instrument of power and a channel of the divine; a means of social bonding and of individual self-definition. Now, as the revolution once wrought by the printed word gives way to the digital age, many fear that the art of writing, and the nuanced thinking nurtured by writing, are under threat. But writing itself, despite striving for permanence, is always in the midst of growth and transfiguration.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Celebrating the impulse to record, invent, and make one's mark, Matthew Battles re-enchants the written word for all those susceptible to the power and beauty of writing in all of its forms.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Featured event books will be for sale at the event for 20% off. Thank you for supporting this author series with your purchases.<\/p> <p>General Info: (617)[masked] - [masked]\u00a0<\/p> <p>Media Inquiries: (617)[masked] x1 - [masked]\u00a0<\/p> <p>Accessibility Inquiries:\u00a0<\/p> <p>[masked]<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Hi all! For this first meetup, the tentative plan is to run what is an approximately 2.5 mile loop beginning in front of the East Boston branch of the Boston Public Library, centrally located at 365 Bremen St. We will utilize the car-free paths of the Bremen Street Park, go onto the Greenway, and make a loop at the East Piers Park eventually making our way back to the library. Of course, everyone should run at their pace, but at the same time faster EBRunners should strive to provide company to the less experienced EBRunners so nobody is running alone for long stretches. Let's hope the weather cooperates, but there is no plan to cancel in the event of a little rain. Please, please make sure running is a safe activity for you before participating. With that said, I look forward to seeing you at this, our first meetup!<\/p>",

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

I have had an incredible experience being apart of this group and have made so many great friends. I have completely fallen in love with Japanese people, the language and culture. It's funny how I finally find a group that I really connect with and then have to leave so soon... But it's not over yet my friends :)<\/p> <p>I will be throwing a huge Japanese food and language party at my house on August 7th and everyone is welcome to come. We will have an incredible selection of authentic Japanese dishes that are near impossible to find in Boston without spending a fortune. We will be able to talk, eat and exchange cultures! It will be awesome!<\/p> <p>I wish I could fund everything for the party but Boston has has been rough on me. If everyone could bring just $10 it would be enough for all of the food, drink and accessories. I assure you it will be amazing :)<\/p> <p>My apartment is located in Roxbury, MA about a 10 minute walk from the Stony Brook Station on the Orange line. I believe I can accommodate 40-50 people but I'm not entirely sure as I have never thrown a party of this size!\u00a0<\/p> <p>If anyone has any question don't hesitate to ask!

        "description": "<p>For New Members AND NON-Members:<\/p> <p>For every sailor who walks through our door, start here! This FREE Orientation class will get you familiar with how everything works at CBI. The orientation class is the gateway to everything that CBI has to offer, whether you\u2019re a seasoned sailor or brand new to boats. Done entirely on the dock, your orientation will include a guided tour of CBI\u2019s boats and facilities, an overview of our classes and programs, as well as plenty of time to ask the questions that matter to you as a sailor. All orientations meet at the base of the American Flag Pole out on the dock, and runs for about half an hour. All are welcome to this class!<\/p> <p><br\/>Afterwards, we invite you to meet one another and ask about other Orientation class attendees' prior experience with sailing. Perhaps you can find a friend to take the Beginner Sailing classes together with once you join.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Friday Nights are also when CBI members go out for Informal Racing, so it is an exciting night to watch the sailors and learn more about how you can progress your skills after learning to sail. Certainly ask your Orientation instructor about the Friday Night Informal Racing and Informal Instruction if he or she does not mention it.

The two men bob and weave around each other, sharing laughs and also possibly revealing hidden frailties \u2013 but it\u2019s never clear how truthful they are being with each other. Ironically, the interview was never published, and five days of audio tapes were packed away in Lipsky\u2019s closet. The two men did not meet\u00a0again. The film is based on Lipsky\u2019s critically acclaimed memoir about this unforgettable encounter, written following Wallace\u2019s 2008 suicide. Both Segel and Eisenberg reveal great depths of emotion in their performances and the film is directed with humor and tenderness by Sundance vet James Ponsoldt from Pulitzer- Prize winner Donald Margulies\u2019 insightful and heartbreaking screenplay.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.coolidge.org\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/IFFBoston2015-offSel_b.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>For those unfamiliar with David Foster Wallace, here is a link to his commencement address, '<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI\">This is Water' <\/a>on YouTube.<\/p> <p>Following the film and credits, we'll meet on the street corner in front of the Coolidge to go to Osaka Japanese Steakhouse and Sushi for dinner and discussion of all things DFW.<\/p> <p>See you at the movies,<\/p> <p>John<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>On the first Friday of every month, approximatly 60 professional artist studios open their studios to the public to show and tell. It's a great opportunity to discuss art that we see: oil painting, watercolor, photography, sculpture--which express social messages, faith, feelings and other forms of human expression.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nIf you are Christian, enjoy free\u00a0 beer and wine, and like discussing art with artists with this\u00a0no cost\u00a0event, join us!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nAbout the host: I've been a practicing Christian for twenty years. One of my passions is viewing all forms of art as human expression. I'm involved with landscape photography in which I sell my prints. I like hanging out with other Christians, who enjoy viewing art and culture.<\/p> <p>For more info, check out: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sowaartistsguild.com\">www.sowaartistsguild.com<\/a><\/p>",

On clear nights, you can view stars, planets, the Moon, and other astronomical phenomena. On cloudy nights, tour the inside of our Observatory, and participate in astronomy-related activities run by our knowledgeable staff.<\/p> <p>This program does not run on nights when the weather is inclement. For more details, and to find out if Astronomy After Hours is running on a given Friday, call our hotline,[masked]-0267. We update each Friday by 5:30pm with the evening\u2019s plans.<\/p> <p>Astronomy After Hours runs seasonally, from the first Friday in March to the last Friday before Thanksgiving. Admission is free thanks to the generosity of the Lowell Institute (parking charges still apply).<\/p> <p>Thanks to Don Doughty for letting us know about the museum.<\/p> <p>Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mos.org\/public-events\/astronomy-after-hours\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.mos.org\/public-events\/astronomy-after-hours<\/a><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>This is the reoccurring meetup for the weekly open water swims at Walden Pond. A well attended venue for triathletes training for races of all distances.<\/p> <p>The gate opens at 7 a.m. and the Parking is right off of Walden St. Walden charges to park a their lot ($5) via a computerized parking attendant that takes cards. I'd recommend the annual pass if you think you're going to come to more meetups. Alternatively,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?saddr=Concord+High+School,+concord+ma&amp;daddr=915+Walden+Street,+Concord,+MA&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=38.93711,-75.966775&amp;sspn=13.846355,14.128418&amp;geocode=FRa1hwIdrlO_-yEidG069HujIg%3BFQqXhwIdjYW_-ylB1q82q5vjiTFsmsu3RKWVtQ&amp;gl=us&amp;mra=ls&amp;t=m&amp;z=16\">It's a short distance from Concord High School<\/a>. Some people avoid the parking fee by parking near Concord High School and then walk\/ride their bike over to Walden.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mass.gov\/dcr\/parks\/trails\/walden.pdf\">Click here for the map of the parking<\/a>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/f\/f\/4\/event_118056852.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Across and back from the beach (Pictured above) is a little over a mile mile; a perfect distance for those training for 70.3 and Ironman races.<\/p> <p>There are also some close to shore routes for people getting better acquainted with open water (see distance maps). We meet near the lifeguard house right on the beach closes to Walden street. Here is the map of walden pond.<\/p> <p>This meetup is important because you always want to swim in groups if you can. Make certain that you look out for each other. Don't attempt to swim across the pond if you haven't trained for that distance. Always match up with someone or a group that swims your pace. The beauty of Walden is that you can swim very close to shallow water and get some good open water training in.<\/p> <p>If there are people that are looking to go long for the first time, let me know in advance and I may be able to swim angel, or get a swim angel group together. That way we can do it in a controlled and safe environment.<\/p> <p>For those that are really new and nervous about open water swimming, stay tuned for a beginners clinic that I'll put on in the summer.<\/p>",

The goal is to demystify graph analytics and mining, and make it accessible to the general programmer. We will go through:<\/p> <p>- graph basics (nodes + edges, list and matrix representations)<br\/>- modelling problems as graphs,<br\/>- preprocessing data using Pandas,importing data using NetworkX,<br\/>- how to compute basic statistics of the network<br\/>- generating visualizations using matplotlib,<br\/>- finding hubs, paths and clusters in the data,<\/p> <p>IPython notebooks and data files will be distributed beforehand on Github to facilitate code distribution.<\/p> <p>Prerequisite Software:<br\/>1. Anaconda distribution of Python installed, with Python 3.4, NetworkX, pandas and matplotlib, and Jupyter notebook installed. Python 2.7 users join the tutorial at their own risk.<\/p> <p>Anaconda installation instructions are shown at this Github repository (page down for instructions: <a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/ericmjl\/network-analysis-made-simple\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/github.com\/ericmjl\/network-analysis-made-simple\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Prerequisite Python:<br\/>At least some prior exposure and use is strongly recommended: For example being able to decipher a data structure for the variables \u2019s\u2019 and \u2018my_fav_things', given the following line of code:<\/p> <p>[s for s in my_fav_things if s[\u2018name\u2019] == \u2018raindrops on roses\u2019]<\/p>",

We will meet, chat, RUN, stretch, chat, EAT BREAKFAST and then leave. It's that easy.<\/p> <p><b>Breakfast Details<\/b> : Between 11:15 and 11:30 (depending on how long we run) we will meet back at City Sports on Comm Ave. near Packards Corner for Pot Luck style brunch.<\/p> <p>Contribute to a great breakfast with an item to share with the group (eggs, bagels, fruits, muffins, juice, bacon, potatoes, etc.) You're not obligated to bring anything, though, so please join us for breakfast after the run anyway.<\/p> <p>ALL ABILITY LEVELS WELCOME!!!<\/p> <p>Secret parking is accessible in the Star Market parking lot (just make sure you walk through Star Market. No one has ever been towed.)<\/p> <p>Bring a friend, see you out there.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.informalrunning.com\">informalrunning.com<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/informalrunning.blogspot.com\">Read the BLOG<\/a><\/p>",

If anyone has bases\/bats etc that they could contribute that would be extremely helpful!<\/p> <p><br\/>After the game(s) we'll head over to CitySide, the Boston home of the Steelers, for drinks! .<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hashtag\/backerswithbats?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=429035590554915\">\u202a#\u200eBackersWithBats\u202c<\/a>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hashtag\/teambmore?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=429035590554915\">\u202a#\u200eTeamBmore\u202c<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\nHey all,<br\/>Our softball game(s) looks to be Saturday June 13th at Moakley Field in South Boston. Still waiting for official confirmation from the park about the field reservation, but they said it shouldn't be a problem. Games will take place between noon and 6 pm. Specific game times will be figured out later. Ravens, Packers, Dolphins and Steelers fan groups attending... possibly more to come.<\/p> <p>There will be an after-party with all teams at The Banshee, the Packers bar, which I am told is a short walk away from the fields. Ray, the Packers organizer and bar manager, is trying to put together some drink specials but no promises he says. If you rsvp and can't make it, it's ok. This is all in good fun like everything we do here. All ages. All skill levels. After party may be age restricted though...not sure yet. If interested, RSVP here so others can see, then email me at [masked] to get on the group email. More details to follow. Looking forward to seeing you guys!<\/p>",

It was not long before Mrs. Collela would come home to increasingly flavorful and satisfying meals.

Fiore can still be found by the stove preparing dishes people crave. If you ask Fiore what keeps him going, the answer is: you.

Jesus is a partner in the pain of the oppressed and the example of His life offers a solution to ending the descent into moral nihilism. Hatred does not empower--it decays. Only through self-love and love of one another can God's justice prevail.<\/p> <p><br\/>Hailed by Life magazine as one of the great preachers of the twentieth century; a spiritual advisor to Martin Luther King, Jr., Sherwood Eddy, James Farmer, A. J. Musty, and Pauli Murray; the first black dean at a white university; cofounder of the first interracially pastored, intercultural church in the United States; Howard Thurman [masked]) was a man of penetrating foresight and astonishing charisma. His vision of the world was one of a democratic camaraderie born of faith, and in light of today's global community, one of particular importance.<\/p>",

Join us in building community among atheists, humanists, skeptics, and curious friends.<\/p> <p><br\/>After our lunch, Joe Gerstein will speak with an update on \u00a0Samuel P. Huntington's \"THE CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS and the Remaking of the World Order\". Prof. Huntington first published an article of this title in FOREIGN AFFAIRS in 1995 which created a sensation. He followed with his treatise in 1996. He made many predictions about the state of the world in the 21st Century, completely refuting \u00a0Fukuyama's paean to Liberal Democracy which predicted that the fall of Communism would engender 'THE END OF HISTORY.' Many of Huntington's predictions and observations were remarkably, and tragically, prescient. Let's assess his accuracy and whether his formulations are still germane from the perspective of 20 years of hindsight.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Dessert will celebrate the 75th Birthday of Ellery Schempp (Abington School District v. Schempp), the plaintiff in a seminal suit that interdicted Bible reading in public schools.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>DIRECTIONS to 410 Hayfield Lane, Wayland (space for parking is at the end of the road): \u00a0<\/p> <p>Several GPS services now contain this address.

The Essex River is a great place to paddle.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will rent with\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.capeannsup.com\/\">www.capeannsup.com<\/a>.\u00a0A half day rental is $50 for four hours, but you can purchase 10 hours for $100, and it doesn't expire at the end of the season. Thus, if you fall in love with paddle boarding and want to continue to go, it would be easy to do for less time and less cost. Based on our experience, 2-3 hours is way more than enough.\u00a0<\/p> <p>*After you RSVP you MUST call Cape Ann SUP and reserve your rental for this day.*\u00a0<\/p> <p>You can tell them it is the MeetUp group with RENEE. They will ask for your phone number; in the event that they don't let people go out due to weather they offer to call you beforehand.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will be meeting at the Essex location at 35 Dodge Street. You will come to a big parking lot and they will have a small set-up near the water.\u00a0Please try to get there by 2:45 PM. Come early, get your sunscreen on, etc. We are going out later in the day this time around because of the tide.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Remember, that if you RSVP and don't bother to show up, you will be marked as a NO SHOW. I don't care if you change your mind, even if it's at the last minute, just be polite enough to let me know. There's nothing that I hate more than waiting for people who never come.\u00a0<\/p> <p>PS I also have set the RSVP's so that people can not add others. This is because in my experience small groups of people will hold up the RSVP list and then not show or cancel at the last minute. If you want others to join they will need to join either North Shore Women's Group or Casual Kayakers first.\u00a0<\/p> <p>AS A CONDITION OF ATTENDING THIS MEETUP, YOU AGREE TO: Hold harmless, and indemnify the organizers and their relations and heirs, and all members and participants of the Meetup group from any and all claims for injury, illness, death, and\/or property damage including those caused by negligence, ignorance, inexperience and other reasons. You also agree to assume all mental, physical, financial, and\/or other risk associated with this meetup. Kayaking, camping, hiking, bicycling, and other activities pose inherent risks and dangers. Participation in these activities is voluntary and dependent upon your own personal judgment. As organizers we make no claims regarding any expertise for this outing. This is not a guided tour. In the interest of safety,\u00a0consuming alcohol before or during any Casual Kayakers event is not allowed.\u00a0Wearing of Lifejackets (PFD's) is required when paddling with this group.<\/p>",

Or perhaps you caught the moment but it is a big blur? Join us Saturday to discover the secrets of taking dynamic, action shots that are in crisp focus and correctly exposed. Oh and\u00a0have fun while you learn. We always have a\u00a0great group and I am sure you\u00a0will enjoy meeting the other photographers.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/c\/2\/4\/600_436355876.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Some topics we will cover:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How to set your camera shutter priority to freeze the action<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How to pan the subject so the background is blurred but the subject is clear<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How to pre focus so when the moment happens, you are ready<\/p> <p>How we will work: We will meet at the hatch shell where I will give a brief introduction to this topic and some handouts. We will experiment with the camera settings for the first assignment and then go in search of action along the river. There are dozens of people walking, skating, biking, boating..... \u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/b\/7\/e\/600_408103902.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Anticipate the shot and get in the right spot.

You can join or not as your\u00a0schedule permits but much can be learned by looking at photos\u00a0together. You will hear yourself say wow how did you get that shot? And learn from\u00a0each other on the spot. \u00a0After class you will be invited to post some of your best photos of the day on our meetup site for constructive critique. More\u00a0details\u00a0about this once you RSVP.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/c\/9\/a\/600_436355994.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Use the shadows to add visual interest to the scene.

Please be ready to tip between 18 &amp; 20 percent as groups tax the staff. As always, remove yourself if you can not attend so those on the wait list can move up.

This also allows us to take turns getting snacks, etc., before the previews start.\u00a0 It also allows for any unexpected, last minute changes at the theater.\u00a0 Although fairly infrequent, having wiggle room to exchange tickets, etc. is VERY helpful.<\/p> <p><b>Please note, everyone is responsible for buying their own tickets.\u00a0 And while it is possible to buy your ticket at the door, shows often sell out.\u00a0I strongly advise you to buy your tickets in advance.\u00a0 I will announce when tickets go on sale on Fandango.\u00a0Please do NOT buy tickets until I have finalized the time.<\/b><\/p> <p>If you miss the group ahead of time, come find us after. We gather in the hallway outside of the theater we just saw the movie in, to discuss the film a bit, allow for restroom breaks and to get a head count of all those who would like to go out after for drinks and munchies.<\/p> <p><b>$$$$Managing the after event is much easier if everyone brings cash, so please plan ahead if you want to go out with the group after.\u00a0 We will be splitting one bill for the group.

        "description": "<p>Echoing as much of Raymond Chandler\u2019s novel as it does the author\u2019s life, <i>The Long Goodbye<\/i> is perhaps Altman\u2019s funniest valentine to Hollywood. While securing screenwriter Leigh Brackett, who co-wrote <i>The Big Sleep<\/i> (1946), which solidified Humphrey Bogart as Chandler\u2019s hard-boiled 1940s detective, Altman made his Philip Marlowe a vulnerable, droll and mumbling Elliott Gould. From the blithely ingenious soundtrack to the casting of characters partially playing themselves, Altman wryly and improvisationally toys with the mythos of Hollywood as it intersects with the reality of Seventies Los Angeles. The film self-deprecatingly encapsulates the contradictions of the time by mixing the carefree and irreverent with uncomfortable confrontation and sudden violence. Sometimes off-frame or partly obstructed, the camera wanders as ambivalently as Marlowe does around a comic parade of deceptive characters and the elusive truth. The detective\u2019s unpredictable path may encounter all of the essential elements of a classic noir; yet Altman\u2019s translucent lens translates these into the disarming, detailed grain of a faded naturalism underscored by Marlowe\u2019s irresolute refrain, \u201cIt\u2019s okay with me.\u201d<br\/>[<a href=\"http:\/\/hcl.harvard.edu\/hfa\/films\/2015junaug\/altman.html#long\">The HFA description<\/a>.]\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/4\/6\/e\/600_440098478.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u201cThe film . . is Altman's most entertaining, most richly complex film since M*A*S*H and McCabe and Mrs. Miller. It's so good that I don't know where to begin describing it. . . . There are lots of eloquent references to Chandler in Altman's method, which is to pack the screen with more bizarre visual and aural detail than can be easily taken in at one sitting. There are also references in the appreciation of California decor, luxurious as well as tacky, and in the throwaway lines and uniformly excellent characterizations, including two by actors who will surprise you, Nina van Pallandt and Jim Bouton.\u201d<br\/>[<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/movie\/review?res=EE05E7DF173FE26FBC4151DFB6678388669EDE&amp;partner=Rotten%2520Tomatoes\">review in the New York Times<\/a> by Vincent Canby, on the film\u2019s release in 1973]<\/p> <p><br\/><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rottentomatoes.com\/m\/1031440-long_goodbye\/\">96% Critics\u2019 rating at Rotten Tomatoes<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Directed by Robert Altman.

        "description": "<p>Join us for a blind tasting of red wines from the Piedmont (aka Piemonte) region of Italy. Piedmont is the second most famous wine region in Italy (after Tuscany). If you are interested in a deeper understanding of Italian wine then learning about Piedmont is a must. \u00a0The Piemonte region generally produces three varieties of red grapes: Barbera (the most planted red grape variety in Piedmont), Nebbiolo, and Dolcetto. These three varieties make up the majority of the red wines from Piedmont but there are other more esoteric varieties as well. All in all, the red wines produced from all of these varieties make up 65% of the wine produced in this region. The other 35% is white wine.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please bring a bottle of red wine from the Piedmont region in the $25 and up price range and 4 glasses each for tasting. The tasting will be blind so please bring bags to cover the labels. Note that the price point is open ended as many of the wines from this region (ie 100% Nebbiolo) can be a bit pricier. It's likely that we will end up tasting mostly Barbera but I wanted to leave the option to bring a bottle of Barolo or Barbaresco on the table. It's worth mentioning that Barolo and Barbaresco are not the only Nebbiolo wines available. You can find excellent Nebbiolo based wines from all over Piemonte for much less including wines from declassified sites.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We plan to have some tasty Italian dishes for you to enjoy with your wine. If you would like to bring an Italian antipasto, formaggi, or dolce please do otherwise $10 to help offset costs please.<\/p>",

Also, be courteous to me and the others. It's almost an hour drive for me. Last time the same number signed up, and no one was there with me. They never canceled.<\/p> <p>If I don't receive confirmations by 7pm tonight, I will reschedule for a different weekend. Thanks for your understanding! A special $5 fee next SA. It is normally $15. A DJ will provide<br\/>the tunes. NO jeans allowed!!!<\/p> <p>The ballroom is huge and has a wonderful wood floor. Some people dance freestyle: others dance ballroom.

        "description": "<p>Mijo de la Palma present their unique blend of Puerto Rican music and contemporary acoustic sounds at The Urbano Project in Egleston Square, Jamaica Plain<\/p> <p>7pm Cheese &amp; Wine reception (Bring a bottle of wine to share) | 8pm Show start<\/p> <p>$10 suggested donation (no one turned away for lack of funds) Born out of the eclectic musical scene in the western side of Puerto Rico, Mijo de la Palma\u2019s sound is an unfolding of handcrafted j\u00edbaro music and modern acoustic rhythms. The earthy, melancholic and intimate lament of the j\u00edbaro intersects with upbeat and catchy tunes of today\u2019s singer-songwriter and flamenco music resulting in their trademark Fusion J\u00edbara. Fusi\u00f3n J\u00edbara is not only a creative blend of poetry and musical textures that redefines the sounds of contemporary Puerto Rican music, it also provides the new generations with music intimately linked to a strong Puerto Rican identity in times of severe political turmoil in the island.<\/p> <p>Their shows are complemented with poets weaving verses into the musical backdrop and visual artists soaking up the creative energy of the night while painting entrancing visuals on the spot. More than a performance from a musical group, their shows are a creative gathering that speaks to and of a land deeply wounded and regenerating in relation to historical memory. Music, in Mijo de la Palma, is a reassertion of cultural roots; it is never forgetting.<\/p>",

Music is played for Standard and Smooth styles such as waltz, foxtrot, and tango as well as Latin and Rhythm styles including salsa, rumba, cha-cha, and the like. At Star Dance School Socials an optional 30 minute group dance lesson kicks off the evening as well!<\/p> <p><b>What on earth should I wear?! <\/b><br\/>Smart-casual to elegant attire is encouraged, but most importantly wear clothing you can move around in comfortably. If you do not have ballroom shoes often a light weight dress shoe will do the trick. *Note: Please avoid sneakers or metal spike-heel shoes as they can damage our floor. Thank you for your understanding!*<\/p> <p><b>Do I need a partner? <\/b><br\/><i>Partners are welcome, but not required<\/i> to enjoy a night out on the town with us! Social dancing is a fantastic way to make new friends and we encourage dancers to rotate partners and meet new people.<\/p> <p><b>Do I need prior dance experience? <\/b><br\/>Whether it is your first time dancing or you have years of ballroom under your belt, all levels are welcome to attend our socials!<\/p>",

I have seen them before, and I highly recommend this one, really soulful music of Puerto Rico<\/p> <p>-Kenny<\/p> <p>The words from the World Music Meetup writeup, courtesy of Luis Cotto:<\/p> <p>Mijo de la Palma present their unique blend of Puerto Rican music and contemporary acoustic sounds at The Urbano Project in Egleston Square, Jamaica Plain<\/p> <p>7pm Cheese &amp; Wine reception (Bring a bottle of wine to share) | 8pm Show start<\/p> <p>$10 suggested donation (no one turned away for lack of funds) Born out of the eclectic musical scene in the western side of Puerto Rico, Mijo de la Palma\u2019s sound is an unfolding of handcrafted j\u00edbaro music and modern acoustic rhythms. The earthy, melancholic and intimate lament of the j\u00edbaro intersects with upbeat and catchy tunes of today\u2019s singer-songwriter and flamenco music resulting in their trademark Fusion J\u00edbara. Fusi\u00f3n J\u00edbara is not only a creative blend of poetry and musical textures that redefines the sounds of contemporary Puerto Rican music, it also provides the new generations with music intimately linked to a strong Puerto Rican identity in times of severe political turmoil in the island.<\/p> <p>Their shows are complemented with poets weaving verses into the musical backdrop and visual artists soaking up the creative energy of the night while painting entrancing visuals on the spot. More than a performance from a musical group, their shows are a creative gathering that speaks to and of a land deeply wounded and regenerating in relation to historical memory. Music, in Mijo de la Palma, is a reassertion of cultural roots; it is never forgetting.<\/p>",

It is part of the National Seashore.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This is a mostly moon-less night, the moon won't come up until 1:20 a.m. and if we have clear skies, this will be a great opportunity to shoot Milky Way arches and star point images, perhaps with short exposure skies and long exposure foregrounds. And, of course, star trails are great, too. We might even see one or the other meteor, as the Perseids meteor shower starts around this time (and peaks on the 12th). And if you stay up late enough, you can shoot a 24% moon coming up in the east and if you want to get the most out of your drive, stay up to catch the sunrise at 5:50, have breakfast in Provincetown. If it is partly cloudy, we will still be meeting, the meetup will only be cancelled in overcast and rainy weather.<\/p> <p><br\/>The sun will set shortly before 8, we will meet half-way through civil twilight, with a little light left in the sky. <a href=\"http:\/\/jmlobert.blogspot.com\/2015\/06\/how-to-see-your-camera-at-night-not.html\">Please bring at home <b>DIM<\/b>, RED lights <\/a>if you absolutely need to use any, headlamps are not allowed! I encourage you to learn handling your camera without lights (practice in a dark room at home: I know that on my camera, the 2nd button from the bottom is ISO, 2nd from top is WB, front wheel is shutter speed, back wheel is aperture, live view is bottom right, that's 99% of what I need). Human eyes need about half an hour to recover from being blinded, please be considerate of the other photographers and their exposures.<\/p> <p><br\/>This is a very dark site, please be safe and wear rugged shoes\/hiking boots, bring some materials for nourishment and perhaps a jacket, it will be a long night, the drive to Truro is easily 2 hours from anywhere.\u00a0 We will be very close to the parking lot, you can fetch more supplies from there or crash in the car for some time.<\/p> <p><br\/>Equipment: consider bringing two cameras and tripods, one to click away, the other for targeted exposures.

Many other animals such as herons, turtles, geese and frogs tend be out as well; enjoy a 1-mile walk\u00a0 as we look for signs that beavers have been around. Appropriate for most strollers.<\/p> <p><br\/>All ages welcome, but younger children not able to walk alongside an adult without tiring will prefer a stroller or carrier. Cancels for rain or thunder. Bug spray, sun protection and water recommended.<\/p> <p>We will meet in front of the visitor's center, which is inside the refuge.\u00a0 From the entrance at 680 Hudson Road, turn into the park and continue about .5 mile down Winterberry Way to the visitor's center.<\/p> <p><br\/>Program led by an AMC leader.\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.outdoorsrx.org\/index.cfm?event=eventID84686-0000000000000000000000&amp;name=Experience-a-Beaver-Pond-for-Families-in-Sudbury\">More info on Outdoors Rx<\/a>.<\/p>",

The long ride adds Stow and Harvard. The long ride passes an impressive array of apple orchards, while taking in a few hills.<\/p> <p>This is the arrow to follow for the ride:<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThis is a re-occuring ride every Sunday beginning in April, with the organized and marked rides of CRW (Charles River Wheelmen). The picture above is from one of last years rides. Don't let the # of RSVPs here fool you, these rides are always well atended usually with over 25 riders of all abilities.<\/p> <p>The distances\u00a0and routes vary every week. We'll have \"No Drop Rule\" so you won't have to worry about getting lost or keeping up. Ride with us if you ride anywhere from 15 to 20 MPH.<\/p> <p>Always bring two spare tubes, and your preferred hydration and nutrition. We don't typically stop for lunch but depending on the ride, there are sometimes options to stop for a bit. Before riding it's good practice to get your bike tuned. Remember to dress for the elements.<\/p> <p>Also CRW organizes a <a href=\"http:\/\/crw.org\/century.php?event=s\">Spring Century<\/a>, a Summer Century called <a href=\"http:\/\/crw.org\/CTTC\/climb2clouds.php\">Climb to the Clouds<\/a>, and a <a href=\"http:\/\/crw.org\/century.php?event=f\">Fall Century<\/a>. All of the Centuries have organized food and water stops. I'm hoping to get a group committed to building up to these Century rides.<\/p>",

Total riding is 33 miles, so there are no calories for any ice cream eaten during this ride.<\/p> <p>Important stuff: Helmets are mandatory and no ear buds or headphones please. You should have 1 - 2 filled water bottles and a spare tube that fits your tire. Lunch is optional (I don't know if there is anywhere along the way to buy something, but, frankly, isn't ice cream a complete meal???). Although this is a no rider left behind ride, it's important to keep a minimum of 11 - 13 mph average pace. I will have printed cue sheets available at the start of the ride.<\/p>",

What if there was group of local friends who banded together to be able to enjoy top quality, organic food at reasonable prices?<\/p> <p>For this Meetup, I'd like to get as many of us together as possible to gather information so we can plan the most useful and affordable co-op possible. What types of products do you use most often? What is the biggest part of your grocery bill? Maybe there is an item you have trouble finding the quality you want? Maybe you just can't keep spending your whole paycheck on dinner. Have access to the best products at the best prices.<br\/>Dry goods like grains, beans, nuts, seeds, coffee, teas, sweeteners<br\/>Body care products like soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, deodorants<br\/>As we grow we can incorporate perishables like locally grow vegetables and fruits (the biggest part of my food budget!)<\/p>",
