Some men have been to retreats and others have joined weekly circles to find their brothers. The goal is simple - to reconnect with the lineage of real masculinity, one that includes all of the complex emotions that men experience and rarely share. In a sacred and confidential men's circle, we step into a world where men can say and hear things that we've longed to express. This honesty and vulnerability allows us to unearth buried emotions and begin to let them go quite naturally. This is vitally important work for ourselves and for our fellow men. Our planet and our children depend upon us to create a new awareness based upon these ancient traditions. What is a typical evening like? Every month, we will gather twice.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Not sure this is for you? Try Session 1 ($25) and pay the balance at the second&nbsp;session if it works for your needs! Thanks to our brother, Jeff, for suggesting this great idea to open the door for more men!<\/b><br><\/p>\n<p><span>The structure will be very simple: 7:00 - 8:00 pm Meditation and Gentle Kripalu Yoga 8:00 - 9:30 pm Open Circle. Who is this program for? Men of any age or background who have a willingness to unite their spiritual, physical and mental selves. Per the schedule, we will be doing some yoga and meditation. Don't worry if you are new to these practices. The atmosphere will be one where men of all abilities are welcome! Can I come for just part of the evening? No. Our goal is to have everyone take part in the entire process. If you have a physical condition that prohibits you from taking part in the yoga, please confer with the teacher who will offer you modifications so that you can participate.

Unlike kayaking or paddle boarding, both which are fun but more solitary water sports, dragon boating has an added aspect of team building.&nbsp; The dragon boat is roughly 40 feet long with the capacity to hold 20 paddlers, a steersperson and a drummer. To move this boat quickly and efficiently those 20 paddlers must paddle in tandem in the same direction with the same goal.<\/p> \n<p>If you are interested please come out to our event and get the full dragon boat experience. As a women\u2019s team the coaching is tailored and adjusted to maximize the unique strengths that women can bring to the sport. We also encourage larger groups, such as professional teams and organizations who need a team building exercise to come out and join us for our \u201cOpen Boat\u201d day.<\/p> \n<p><b>What is provided:<\/b> Dragon boats, Paddles, PFD (Personal Floatation Device), Coaching\/ instruction, storage for small bags and keys<\/p> \n<p><b>Please wear<\/b>: temperature appropriate (remember most days the sun is beating down on us) clothing that is either dry- fit or fast drying.

Water resistant shoes (flip flops are fine)<\/p> \n<p><b>Please bring<\/b>: A bottle of water (you will need to hydrate). A change of clothing (in the case that you do get wet)<\/p> \n<p><b>Women in Canoe<\/b> is a 501(c)3 sporting organization that was established in 2000 by women, for women to realize their full potential starting with a healthy lifestyle in a supportive environment centered around the sport of dragon boating. Inherently the sport fosters collaboration and teamwork (making a boat that is over 40 feet long and 500+ lbs, not including the paddlers, move is no small task). The team has since continued in its commitment to the community by following its mission to foster the well-being of women from all backgrounds and all ages. We are proud to be a reflection of our home base, Queens, in our diversity and fortunate enough to be&nbsp;multi-generational, as we value&nbsp;experience as much as exuberance.

It's a great idea to incrementally add to your network of acquaintances and interact with diverse interesting people with new interesting ideas. The group is NOT: For pickups and dating; there are enough sites for that! For sales and promotion - don't accost anyone with multilevel propositions or life coach pitches - Not interested. Open to all ages, races, genders and cross-genders, nationalities, languages As long as you're interesting because you're interested in something that someone else might get excited about. Of course you're socially adept for conversation and exchange. Rules: Upload a real picture, Indicate your profession, Indicate lines of interest, Supply email address, Pay for your own drink. There will be no formal group meetings; there are enough of those. If you feel it would be interesting to have one drink with someone regardless of age, gender etc., communicate by email indicating why and you two can arrange. Meetup encourages groups, Facebook is for faces, I hope this helps interesting people casually meet without an agenda.

I\u2019m interested in starting an educational Role Playing Game Club in the area. &nbsp;As a member of the <a href=\"http:\/\/ProfessionalGameMasterSociety.com\">Professional GameMaster Society<\/a>, I believe that RPGs are a wonderful pastime, and at the same time also can be a very creative teaching-learning experience as well. &nbsp;I started playing RPGs when I was a freshman in High School, and started GamesMastering in at that time, way back in 1978. &nbsp;So I have quite a bit of experience with creating fabulous adventures in the realm of the imagination and playing them out as wondrous Campaigns in the often astounding World of Elthos.&nbsp; I've run a number of educational RPG programs for kids in the area in the past, and would like to build on that foundation to create a truly unique and wonderfully creative educational experience for kids in the future. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Style of Play <\/b><\/p>\n<p>I play fairy tale and medieval fantasy campaigns, with a bit of science fiction mixed in here and there, which makes it suitable for children as well as adults. &nbsp; I customize my game according to the age and interests of my Players. My emphasis has always been on the quality of the storyline, and the enjoyment of the players. My goal is to provide the Players a sense of team spirit, critical thinking, good sportsmanship, the benefits of investigation, planning, organization, and the perils and rewards associated with risk taking, determination, courage, and fair play. &nbsp;I will also be endeavoring, within the context of the game, to expose the players to certain educational materials, such as classical artwork and music (with brief discussions) as well as history, philosophy, and where applicable, science and math. &nbsp;This is all done in the frolicking world of Elthos where adventures involve battling giants and dragons, or exploring realms beyond the far reaches of the known world, depending on what the young heroes decide to do with their Characters in the game World. &nbsp;It\u2019s a truly fabulous way to learn!<\/p>\n<p><b>Elthos: The RPG System&nbsp; <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>I created the first version of the Elthos RPG in 1978. It is a system of my own design based off of the original version of D&amp;D.&nbsp; In recent years I distilled down my original Elthos system to a much more efficient mini-system that makes for greater ease-of-play, and then went on to program the mini-system as an online application named <b>The Mythos Machine<\/b>.&nbsp; It serves to make my games highly efficient for both myself and my players. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>The Arrangements <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>I can either play via an online venue using Roll20 or similar Virtual Table Top software, or in person, depending on the preferences of the Players.&nbsp; For local in-person games, because there is an theatrical aspect to the playing of Role Playing Games, atmosphere is an important factor. &nbsp;Particularly lighting and the coziness of the play area makes a significant difference. &nbsp;A table for players to use as a writing surface is required as well as a table for the GameMaster. &nbsp; I would favor a consistent time and location for the games as that would make it easier on everyone for scheduling and transportation.&nbsp; I would run 1 game sessions per week for any given group of players.<\/p>\n<p><b>Pricing&nbsp; <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>$10.00 \/ Hour per Player (minimum of 6 players, maximum of 12) <br><\/p>\n<p><b>The Club Rules<\/b>&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p><i>Place and Time<\/i>: Games will be held on the Second and Fourth Sunday of each month at the specified time and location.<\/p>\n<p><i>Players<\/i>: &nbsp;There can be a minimum of 6 and maximum of 12 club players during a given game. &nbsp;A Club Player Waiting List can be created if necessary. Elthos games are appropriate for young adults between the ages of 11 and 15.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>Player Attendance<\/i>: Players who can not attend the game should contact the GM by email or cell phone to let the GM know that they won\u2019t be able to make it. They may at that time assign any character(s) that they have in the current game to be played either by the GM or another Player at their discretion. If no contact is made then the character(s) will be played at the GM\u2019s discretion. &nbsp;Players who do not show up for three consecutive games may have their position replaced by someone on the waiting list, and their Character may be assigned the status of \u201cRed Shirt\u201d (most players will understand what that means).<\/p>\n<p><i>Payment<\/i>: &nbsp;The club game fee will be collected on a per game basis at the standard rate, payable through the Meetup website.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p><i>Code of Conduct<\/i>: Players must behave in a polite manner toward other Players and the GM at all times or they may be benched for the game. Good sportsmanship will be emphasized. &nbsp;I'll do my best to take this club in the direction that the majority of members seem to want to go. I'll often ask for member input into various happenings in the club and I'll be receptive to ideas and criticisms by members regarding the club. However, if I find that a member is acting in such a way as to disrupt club activities or ruin other member's enjoyment of the event, that member will be dismissed from the Club.<\/p>\n<p><i>Arbitration\/Disputes<\/i>: &nbsp;The GM will arbitrate all game related disputes and those decisions must be considered final.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>Well, let me know if this plan seems good to you, or if you have any suggestions. &nbsp;I look forward to hearing from you. <br><\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>Sincerely Yours,<\/p>\n<p>Mark Abrams,<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/u\/0\/111193673863924049303\/about\">Professional GameMaster Profile<\/a><\/p>\n<p>of<a href=\"http:\/\/professionalgamemastersociety.com\/\"> The Professional GameMaster Society<\/a><\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/f\/f\/9\/600_438276857.jpeg\"><\/p>","lon":-73.7799987793,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":2428395,"name":"Mark"},"members":1,"name":"Elthos Game Club","id":18650124,"state":"NY","urlname":"Elthos-Game-Club","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":41.0499992371,"who":"Elthosians"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433476930000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fashionista","name":"Fashionista","id":918},{"urlkey":"fashion","name":"Fashion Industry","id":1924},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"fashion-and-style","name":"Fashion and Style","id":16575},{"urlkey":"fashion-entrepreneurs-sharing-successful-secrets","name":"Fashion Entrepreneurs","id":19355},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"fashion-design","name":"Fashion Design","id":21437},{"urlkey":"fashion-shows","name":"Fashion Shows","id":27075},{"urlkey":"clothing-and-fashion-designers","name":"Clothing and Fashion Designers","id":71747}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklynstylistanddesigners\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/4\/b\/600_438411531.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>Stylinar\u2019s&nbsp;mission is to empower, educate, inspire and arm pupils with a blueprint that will enable them to tap into their interest and passion for wardrobe styling.

In this group, you'll do guided meditations, creative exercises, Haiku writing, and story-catching to get past your analytic mind and learned conventions and express your ideas more creatively from your spirit or intuition. To help you with this, I'll teach you the art of joriki, a Zen term for illuminating the light or spirit within and blending with the light of the source or spirit without. Learning to write from this place also helps you see the world from a more inspired and intuitive place, which in turn deepens the expression of your writing. <\/p>\n<p><b>This group has a heavy emphasis on spirituality, meditation, learning to live intuitively, and learning to connect with your own spirit from where your inspiration flows.<\/b> <b>It is not about manuscript critiquing or the business of publishing. <\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>About me: <\/b>I'm a a published author, an award nominated scriptwriter and journalist, with a career ranging from an Iraq War correspondent to lifestyle and spirituality feature writing. My work has been featured on BBC, NPR, McClatchy News and the Huffington Post. <\/p>\n<p>I combine my writing ability with these faculties to access the wisdom of the spirit to create work that is healing for me and for many around me. Using intuition to find that point of inspiration both inside and out in all circumstances has always been important in my work.<\/p>\n<p>Many people have been astonished with the originality and beauty of the work they have produced during these classes. While it can be intense, this is a thoroughly enjoyable and creative class. No writing experience is needed and sharing your writing with the group is entirely optional. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>A note on places:<\/b> (1) Places are limited to ensure everyone has the opportunity and attention needed to develop and explore your own inspiration and creativity. I also need to pay for the room in advance, so please pay via paypal [karen at celticmedium.com] or Meetup when you RSVP. (2) RSVPs must be received 24 hours before the meetup. (3) If you want to pay at the door, please email me to confirm that there is a place open.

This meetup is designed for anyone who is suffering from any variety of health issues. This can range anywhere from chronic headaches, to visual disturbances, to depersonalization, and anything else that you may be seeking an answer for. This group is meant to be a support system and a place where we can share our experiences and offer suggestions on things we\u2019ve tried that might help others. Topics I hope to cover include conventional treatments, alternative therapies, nutritional health, and spiritual health. The goal is to heal as completely as possible. In addition, I hope to plan fun things for us to be able to do as a group. <\/p>\n<p>A little about me: <\/p>\n<p>My name is Alan and for 14 years, I was suffering from a number of health issues. This included chronic headaches, dizziness, anxiety, digestion issues, cognitive issue, insomnia, visual issues, and TMJ issues, just to name a few. I was also experiencing this pervasive feeling that something just wasn\u2019t right, although I could never pinpoint what it was. I spent many years trying all kinds of treatments and therapies to no avail. I\u2019ve been to every type of doctor out there and tried every alternative, nutritional, and spiritual remedy imaginable. A little over a year ago, I finally came across a therapy that has helped me tremendously. I\u2019ve finally been able to overcome most of what I was experiencing. The hardest part throughout everything was never having anyone to talk to. I know how hard and lonely the journey can be, and wanted to create a group where anyone and everyone who might be going through their own ordeal can turn to for support. <\/p>\n<p>My hope is that we can become a family that grows together, and ultimately have an impact on each other\u2019s journeys.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":186351000,"name":"Alan"},"members":41,"name":"Headaches, dizziness, anxiety and this thing I cant explain","id":18656568,"state":"NY","urlname":"thisthingicantexplain","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Wanaque","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433737416000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"pagan","name":"Pagan","id":486},{"urlkey":"asatru","name":"Asatru","id":770},{"urlkey":"metaphysics","name":"Metaphysics","id":774},{"urlkey":"goddess","name":"Goddess","id":1052},{"urlkey":"shamanism","name":"Shamanism","id":1254},{"urlkey":"drumcircle","name":"Drum Circle","id":2278},{"urlkey":"wiccan","name":"Wiccan","id":3862},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"heathen","name":"Heathen","id":15102},{"urlkey":"pagan-social","name":"Pagan Social","id":32452},{"urlkey":"earth-based-spirituality","name":"Earth-Based Spirituality","id":37479},{"urlkey":"everything-witchcraft","name":"Witchcraft","id":74176},{"urlkey":"norse-paganism","name":"Norse Paganism","id":89546},{"urlkey":"heathenry-or-heathenism-or-heathens","name":"Heathenry or Heathenism or Heathens","id":102841},{"urlkey":"summer-solstice","name":"Summer Solstice","id":107023}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-Jersey-Pagans\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>New Jersey Pagans is the Largest Online and Offline Community in NJ We have been serving the community for over 15 yrs.

The Christian Kirtan meetup group is going to exemplify the spirit of religious devotional chanting except using mainly Christian tunes and lyrics offset by instruments. However, the group will not be closed to spiritual fusion, or the incorporation of tunes from other cultures, such as Irish, French, or Indian, during rehearsal and performance. The main idea is to combine the Christian spirit and kirtan music, hopefully on a weekly basis, if not more often, throughout the year, whether outdoors or indoors in NYC. Later, when our members are consolidated, we can consider doing weddings and performing other events. We are going to experience the joy of kirtan, Christian-hearted, and then spread it to other people by setting a good example, loving our neighbors while disseminating peace, music, and spirituality.

Come join me on the mat to simply do vinyasa yoga in a state-of-the-art studio. The studio is conveniently located in Union Square area. The size of the class is always 10 yoga practitioners max. You will move and breath in carefully curated music. Mats and props will be provided. Towels and waters are not provided. The only thing I ask from you is to reserve your space early and avoid last minute cancellation so the space can be given to someone else. Just come wearing something that's comfortable enough to move in and you already have everything you need.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the organizer:<\/strong> I am a yoga practitioner of 5 years and a 200hr Certified Yoga Instructor living and working in NYC. Outside of yoga, I have a full time job which I love and a supportive group of love ones so on most days I am happy. But just like everyone who lives in this city, the pressure of the daily life can be overwhelming and difficult to manage sometimes. Through the regular practicing of yoga, I frequently discover new ways to keep my life balance, maintain self control and create more space to care for others; and I want to share my practice with you.

Here's how this will work:<\/p>\n<p>1) A dinner theme for the event is proposed, a likely location provided. Location will be someone's home, or, perhaps, picnic in the park (all ideas welcome).<\/p>\n<p>2) Those interested in the theme sign up (RSVP).<\/p>\n<p>3) The organizer(s) comes up with the menu and dishes out responsibilities.<\/p>\n<p>4) Want to attend but no time to cook? If there's room, maybe the organizer allows you to just bring some wine.<\/p>\n<p>5) We get together, share the food, make friends.<\/p>\n<p>This can be anything from potluck dinners to 12 course tasting menus. Probably not limited to dinners either. No rules!<\/p>\n<p>Open to all: from anyone who simply wants to learn how to cook and needs an excuse to practice to professional chefs.

Or maybe you're an experienced meditater and are looking for a group of like-minded seekers to meditate with? Join us every Monday as we dive into the deeper teachings, then sit together for 45 minutes utilizing a myriad of meditation techniques that you can then utilize at home. No experience necessary! We offer a supportive community of new and experienced meditaters with the intention of diving deeper into the practice. Meditation is a journey of self-discovery. By making the mind calm and quiet, we can go deep within and discover who we really are. By doing so, we find lasting peace and happiness and learn how to effectively solve our life-problems and realize our highest aspirations.<\/p>\n<p>All meditations are meant to purify our heart and bring our mind to its natural condition. Our consciousness is inherently pure, eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. But somehow or other it has been covered by and adulterated by so many misconceptions, so many desires, so many longings, so many anxieties about what we want and what we don\u2019t want.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When you look into a mirror, you see yourself. But what if that mirror has been neglected for hundreds of years? There are layers and layers of debris, dust, dirt and filth. And when you look into that mirror, all you see is the dust and the dirt that is accumulated, and all that you think is \u201cThis is me!\u201d But when you clean the mirror, little by little you start seeing the image of yourself. And when the mirror is actually clean, you see who you are.

Our slogan is simple and it fits with our mission: \"We Educate to Elevate Women in Business.\" We believe that TRAINING is the key to success for most women in business. However, most entrepreneurs do not take the time out to get the training that they need to take their businesses to the next level. The Network for Women in Business help business owners by providing them with the most up-to-date and cutting-edge training in all aspects and areas of business. It doesn't matter if you're a solo-preneur or an entrepreneur running a multi-million dollar company with hundreds of employees or a home-based business owner, we have something for you.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>We are gearing up to be the premiere site for training women in business in all aspects of business from getting started, writing business plans, to developing a social media strategy or PR strategy. Within no time at all, the Network for Women in Business site will be filled with an archive of training unlike any other. It will be the place you come back to over and over again, not only for the training but also for the CONNECTIONS that you will be able to make with our members. When we launched our Facebook page on December 15, 2011, we had no idea that by the 28th of the same month that we would have over 2,000 Fans! Our official launch is slated for the 15th of January 2012. By the time that date comes, we anticipate that we will be very close to having 5,000 Facebook Fans, which should easily translate into a very active membership base.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Premium membership allows our members and their businesses to be highlighted in our member directory for the world to see. This will allow members to connect with the right people to help them grow. Members will be able to ADVANCE their businesses. By being a member of the Network of Women in Business you will be able to increase your production and sales as a direct result of taking advantage of our training. You will be able to see a measurable difference in your bottom line. You will be able to say...\"Before I was on the Network my business was _____ and after joining the Network my business has increased by ____as a result of being on the Network.\"<\/p>\n<p>Never before has there existed an online space like the Network for Women in Business.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/f\/5\/highres_440579381.jpeg","photo_id":440579381,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/f\/5\/600_440579381.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/f\/5\/thumb_440579381.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":182635110,"name":"Mary S Newman"},"members":46,"name":"NYC Small Biz Boot Camp for Women","id":18667861,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Small-Biz-Boot-Camp-for-Women","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"White Plains","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1434122250000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"e-commerce","name":"E Commerce","id":16354},{"urlkey":"magento","name":"Magento","id":16390},{"urlkey":"internet-ecommerce","name":"E-Commerce","id":27954},{"urlkey":"best-practices-for-high-performance-ecommerce","name":"Best Practices for High Performance eCommerce","id":117430},{"urlkey":"magento-designers","name":"Magento Designers","id":123242},{"urlkey":"magento-developers","name":"Magento Developers","id":123243},{"urlkey":"magento-enterprise","name":"Magento Enterprise","id":128799},{"urlkey":"ecommerce-technology","name":"eCommerce Technology","id":132503},{"urlkey":"online-retailers","name":"Online Retailers","id":135451},{"urlkey":"e-commerce-business","name":"e-commerce business","id":153685},{"urlkey":"ecommerce-workshops","name":"ECommerce Workshops","id":158613},{"urlkey":"ecommerce-social-media","name":"Ecommerce & Social Media","id":230121},{"urlkey":"magento-meetups","name":"Magento Meetups","id":676752},{"urlkey":"e-commerce-internet-marketing","name":"E-Commerce - Internet Marketing","id":788082},{"urlkey":"ecommerce-marketing","name":"eCommerce Marketing","id":805252}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westchester-Connecticut-Ecommerce-Meetup\/","rating":4.33,"description":"<p>This is a group for ecommerce enthusiasts focused on Magento and other major ecommerce platforms.

A little about me: I've been studying combatives since the age of 13 (currently 43). I ve been a Fundamentals Level Coach with Blauer Tactical Systems (www.tonyblauer.com) since 2006. Over the course of my 30 year martial journey I've studied Boxing, Wing Chun, JKD, BJJ, Kali and Kinamotay. Additionally, I hold Personal Defense Readiness certifications in Weapons, and Ground Fighting. My approach to training is three dimensional with an emphasis on the micro-analysis of the emotional, psychological and physiological aspects of the ambush attack. When focusing on self preservation, it's imperative that one understands that weathering the components of a truly ballisic attack is beyond mastering any said technique or style of combat. Rather, it is a daily process of accepting and acclimating oneself to the asymmetrical, off -balance nature of the attack, embracing the chaos and then training to engage the necessary tools to neutralize the threat. What differentiates my training paradigm from others is that I don't promote teaching the body to conform to satisfy a martial art. Rather, I believe in using the body\u2019s natural and instinctive movement patterns to help protect oneself within the close quarter range. This includes: \u2022 Utilizing the hard-wired, DNA of our body\u2019s survival reflex to as the ignition switch to our movements \u2022 Non-gender, age, size, or occupation specific \u2022 All movements, are based on \u201cfunctional movement\u201d \u2022 All movements are elemental &amp; fundamental to survival so we are preparing for the 'unknown &amp; unknowable' This is a group for anyone interested&nbsp; in true self defense. Self protection includes awareness, fear management, verbal and physical skills. It can\/will include blunt weapons, fire arms, multiple attackers and confined spaces. I started this group in order to meet others that share the same passion. No prior training is required to join. If you have prior training, what you'll learn won't negate it. In fact, it will bridge the gap. <strong>DISCLAIMER: At the risk of sounding brash, PLEASE DO NOT JOIN IF YOU ONLY HAVE A CASUAL INTEREST. I'm looking to meet with people that have a SERIOUS interest&nbsp; and&nbsp;who will commit to&nbsp;at least 2 hours&nbsp; a week.

We, the organizers (Sharon and Louisa) are very passionate about Angelic Reiki and feel that Spirit is pushing us to spread the word, so that in a few years' time, Angelic Reiki will be well known to the metaphysical community. We especially want to reach out to those practicing other forms of energy healing and assure these healers that whatever form of healing you're already doing, that healing and Angelic Reiki are not mutually exclusive. So, for example, If you are a healer and practice Usui Reiki, you SHOULD learn Angelic Reiki so that you can add it to your arsenal. This is not about a competition!!!

It's about recognizing all bodies as valid, good, and worthy of love and acceptance. It's about standing up against bullying, body shaming, and fat shaming. And of course we reject society's beauty standards telling us how we're supposed to look! <br>What is naturism? Naturism is the practice of going naked in a non-sexual environment, but for myself and many others, it's also based on a philosophy of acceptance and respect. Naturists believe the human body should be celebrated, and we reject the idea that the body is shameful, dirty or obscene. Naturism fosters positive body image and self-esteem, and has other social &amp; psychological benefits. Naturists also live in harmony with nature and respect the environment. <br>With all the issues surrounding the female body, such as slut-shaming &amp; victim-blaming, street harassment, sexual objectification, beauty standards, sexism and so on, women especially need safe spaces where we can reclaim our bodies, band together and support one another! <br>In this group, we will: <br>\u2022 Attend lectures &amp; events related to body image \/ acceptance <br>\u2022 Engage in body positive activism <br>\u2022 Have clothing-optional and topfree (topless) social meetups <br>\u2022 Go on outdoor excursions like topfree hiking and skinny dipping <br>\u2022 And we're open to suggestions! <br>This group is open to women of all ages and trans women as well.

This is great for those busy entrepreneurs who find it difficult to maintain a social life or just want to socialize with people of similar class. <\/span>This is especially great for individuals wishing to attend more black-tie events, but don't know where to start.&nbsp;People who are tired of the same lame nightclub parties and want something more high-class.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>We provide private and exclusive upscale events that cater to wealthy \"high rollers\" seeking lavish and extravagant entertainment. For those who can afford the affluent lifestyle, but may not necessarily have the social network or time to enjoy the luxuries that come with it. Our events include high end parties, galas, black tie events, masquerade balls, social gatherings, exclusive dinners, out of town trips, tasteful nightlife entertainment and more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I started this group as a way to bring together a group of elite individuals who could use some entertainment. I have an extensively large network of business vendors and celebrities that I would like to utilize. Many of them are NYC's top upscale nightclubs, five star restaurants, high end hotels, actors, musicians, models, dancers and more. I work in the film and television industry and a majority of my job includes working with many celebrities, businesses and city officials.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As such, I have developed a great working relationship with many of the owners and corporate managers of these businesses, from the NYC mayor's office down to the smallest local mom and pop store. I would like to make use of my large network and also help hard working individuals enjoy quality entertainment. Don't worry, you'll get a say in these events. I'm open to any ideas that some of you high rollers might have. If you can think it up, I can most likely make it happen.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><span>**PLEASE NOTE**&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Most event functions will require black-tie or semi formal attire.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>Proceeds from these events will go towards various select charities and non profit organizations.<\/span><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/a\/0\/1\/highres_438854849.jpeg","photo_id":438854849,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/a\/0\/1\/600_438854849.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/a\/0\/1\/thumb_438854849.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":28577402,"name":"Ms Chance"},"members":13,"name":"NYC Pure Luxe Events","id":18684917,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Pure-Luxe-Events","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"High Rollers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1434745302000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wholefood","name":"Whole Food Nutrition","id":5951},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"business","name":"Business","id":10575},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"diet","name":"Diet","id":17417},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"careers","name":"Career","id":22888},{"urlkey":"network","name":"network","id":26137}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Risingentrepreneurs\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This is a group for anyone interested in creating multiple sources of income, without disrupting their current income source.

While sitting at a table at the bar I overheard the friend talking about his girlfriend saying \"Girls just can't understand finance.\" Of course I chimed in and said WTF?! are you joking me?? OBVI if i had studied finance in college, then I would be sick at finance.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Anyway, after this conversation, I realized that I would like to learn more about this predominantly male-driven field that our entire society is so dependent on. I would like at some point in my life be adequately educated on the stock market so that when I'm a \"grown-up\" I can make my own intelligent financial decisions. I'd like to converse with wall street peeps and be able to comprehend what it is that they do. But mostly, I am a person that loves to learn, and I would like to acquire some knowledge about this topic in which I am so pathetically ignorant about.&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/5\/f\/b\/highres_438834779.jpeg","photo_id":438834779,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/5\/f\/b\/600_438834779.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/5\/f\/b\/thumb_438834779.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":185020967,"name":"Arielle"},"members":1,"name":"Girls Don't Understand Finance.

One of the primary functions of this organizations is to represent artists who have been working among union actors and are getting short changed. Say for example; its pouring rain on a set in Brooklyn and you ask to go inside to holding. When the P.A. says no then you need to hang out and wait, as it rains. BUT a Union Actor standing next to you gets \"WET\" pay. Others do not. And I don't think that's fair. Same goes for Meal Penalties. They are not applied to the NON Union workers and that also is not far. Also as a sole proprietor on set NON Union have no say in there rates\/wages for work. That also is Unfair.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Our Short Term goal as of now is not to UNIONIZE but to Stand United.

Fontanel bone was the soft bone on the top of our head when we were babies gets calcified when our ego and superego develops. When the energy passes through fontanel bone, we enter into state of thoughtless awareness. This state brings our attention into present. Our thoughts start to slow down and we feel cool breeze flowing from our both hands and top of head. This experience is called \" Self-realization\".&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Top reasons you should do Sahaja meditation:<\/p>\n<p>1.

In fact, since 1985, BNI members worldwide have exchanged over 15 Million business referrals, totaling over $8 Billion in new business.  In BNI, only one person per profession may join a local chapter.  And that means once you join us, you have completely locked out your competition.  However, if your competition joins first, the opportunity is gone. BNI is category exclusive, so once you join, you will not be competing with someone in the same profession for referrals.  If you consider networking and\/or referrals to be an important part of new business development for your business, BNI represents a high-value opportunity for you.\n\nAs a reminder here's why we wake up early Wednesday mornings. 98% of businesses rely on referrals to build new business.

Well, if you are looking for a group that celebrates artists like these then look no further. From concerts by the original artists, to tribute\/cover bands, to happy hours, to other fun events, we have you covered! New York City has plenty of events centered around New Wave 80s (yes, and 90s too) music, and a lot of cool venues to experience this live music. So if you want to take advantage of all this, then come aboard the new Not-So-New Wave Rockers of NYC Meetup Group. Other social events will be had, as well as pre (and post) show happy hours to give members opportunities to hang out. The goal of this group is to create modest size, close-knit, meetups instead of the large groups where people can feel lost in the crowd. Finally, I am seeking a few co-organizers - so if you are interested, please let me know. Don't worry, I will not ask much of you!

How many of you have tried every diet out there without true success? Diets are temporary. Your lifestyle is more important ! Let me tell you more about my journey and share that of others in a small or mid-sized group setting. We can chat about YOUR goals, YOUR lifestyle, and ways that I can help you gain that energy back. I don't promise a miracle - and all results are individual. What I can tell you is that my friend Christina and Advocare saved my life; I want to pay it forward.

Sugar levels dropped too!&nbsp;<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p>A real story -- my friend Matt has been complaining of soreness and lack of energy.

My friend Dee has three children and works multiple jobs, which means long hours. She would like to have better focus and energy to keep up with her day-to-day schedule.

If you have the same problem, let's meet up and swap food! We will meet bi-weekly and each member who RSVP's will make a dish that is equivalent to 5 cups of baby food (40 oz), package it in 10 small baggies, and swap with other members. Moms will be assigned a category for their dish before each meet-up: vegetable, carb, or protein. All food must be prepared using organic ingredients. Meet-ups will be at various times and can include bringing along the babies--weekday afternoons, morning coffee, weekend brunch, happy hour. All meet-ups will be in the BoCoCa area.

This Meetup group provides adults 50+ with the opportunities to meet and mingle with others from the New York tri-state area during casual and extremely low-pressure events. Some events we have put on in the past are \u201cSpeed-Meeting\u201d events, movie screenings, coffee get-togethers, and more. We welcome anyone 50 and older, who is looking for any type of companionship, to join, and strongly encourage future Meetup suggestions and ideas!<\/p>\n<p>What is Stitch.net?<br>Stitch.net is an online service, which helps adults 50 years and over find the companionship they are looking for. For some people this might be a romantic partner, for others it could be just a friend who likes partaking in the same activities. Stitch recognizes that there are many different types of companionship, and that the need for companionship doesn\u2019t go away as we get older. You can read more about Stitch.net on Stitch.net\u2019s FAQ page here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stitch.net\/FAQ\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.stitch.net\/FAQ<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Please Note:<br>-Even though we highly recommend it, you will never be required or pressured to join Stitch.net\u2019s online services, and will never be required to be on Stitch.net to attend an event going forward.<\/p>\n<p>-Some of the RSVPs for our events will be done through a different website other than Meetup when we have to limit the number of attendees. Due to all of Stitch.net\u2019s members not being on Meetup, we believe this is the most fair way to RSVP for these types of events.

With this particular style of dance for <i><b>women<\/b><\/i> called the Dance of the Sacred Art Form, you will learn how to enter into your heart center and connect with your higher self to bring about transformation in your life, for your mate, family, community, and nature. The body is guided by chi or life force energy. The power of the heart center coupled with focused intent will help you connect with the divine within. Truly a cosmic, spiritual experience that is certain to guide you to higher heights of movement and dance. Workshops will be a combination of hands on training and lecture. You will learn about the sacred geometry of the body, the microcosm\/macrocosm of the human form, spiritual\/energetic expression of movement, intoning\/sound healing combined with dance, how to direct energy, conscious elevation, and more. Dancing in this sense becomes the prayer, the meditation, the ritual and ceremony.<\/p>\n<p> If we get enough interested <i><b>women<\/b><\/i>, I will teach workshops in northern jersey and central jersey.

To fulfill this aim we have created a peaceful city sanctuary located in the heart of Chelsea. Based on the books of the modern day Buddhist teacher, Ven. Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, we present Buddha\u2019s teachings in an accessible manner that can easily be integrated into our modern lives.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Established over twenty years ago, hundreds of New Yorkers currently participate in our programs at the main center and throughout the city. The Center is run by volunteers who themselves are dedicated practitioners, and we have a warm and welcoming community. Please feel free to drop in for a visit. During opening hours there is always someone at hand who can answer your questions. In addition to the beautiful meditation room, you can also check out our&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/bookstore-giftshop\/\">bookstore and gift shop<\/a>, or just spend time in our comfortable sitting and reading area. (Reference materials are available.)<\/p>\n<p>If you wish to participate in the activities at the center, we recommend that you begin with one of our&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/study-programs\/general-program-classes\/\">General Program classes<\/a>.

Taught by qualified Western teachers, the meditation classes and Buddhist philosophy are very easy to understand and apply to our daily lives.

We also think that by removing clothes, we\u2019ll get rid of preconceived notions of how we are supposed to move according to the social status and social group associated with clothes; also, different dance styles are usually associated with different attire, whereas we want to give your body full freedom in motion and let you move the way you want irrespective of style. In other words, free your ass, and your mind will follow!<\/p>\n<p>The class is based on various street\/urban dance styles, such as hip-hop, breaking, krump, house, etc. Electronic music and various mixes will serve as the musical accompaniment for the class, to get your energy flowing and your heart pumping while you have fun, learn and get a great workout in the process!

Here's how it works: 1) Come to the event, 2) mention the code (published here for each event) at the door or at the bar (you'll see the organizer) 3) get a wristband. Everyone who came for the meet up will know why you're there but to others it will just be a group of people wearing typical bar\/club wristbands. Make sure you remember your favorite chat handle on whatsapp, kik, line etc. and meet people without having to give your phone number, any personal info or pics. The rest is up to you.

Our intention is to bring together some of the main esoteric streams and movements within the western hermetic tradition, under the apophthegm of the Rosicrucian ideal, as stated in the Fama and Confessio: a brotherhood, working in secrecy, focused on a sincere inner development of its members, thereby affecting the world at large, without any interest of financial gain. The name, Sodalitas Rosae+Crucis &amp; Solis Alati, is in fact the name of two Orders; the first, Sodalitas Rosae+Crucis (S.R.C.), translates into 'The Secret Society of the Rosy Cross', thus representing the Rosicrucian flavour of the magical and mystical processes that lead the candidate to a full contact with his\/her Holy Guardian Angel. The second, Sodalitas Solis Alati (S.S.A.), which translates into \"The Secret Society of the Winged Sun\", indicates the alchemical work that the adept is then ready for. Within these two Orders, the magical work and initiations of the Golden Dawn, Alpha &amp; Omega and Rosae Rubeae et Aurea Crucis, the mystical work and initiations of Christian Theurgy and the alchemical work of the Royal Path integrates into a coherent system of personal unfoldment and development, where every step follows the next in a clear and consistent way. The purpose of the Order is the perpetuation and realization of the western Hermetic tradition in this new era.

JOIN US. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN:<\/b> <br>Life is tough.&nbsp; It's even harder when you're trying to accomplish big goals.&nbsp; And well, it's nearly impossible to accomplish those big goals entirely by yourself.&nbsp; So... why not share your goals and dreams with other winners and get their feedback?&nbsp; Why not encourage others with your unique perspective on their situations?&nbsp; EVERYONE needs encouragement and 'outside the box' thinking.&nbsp; This group can provide that encouragement and outside-the-box thinking.&nbsp; More importantly, you can provide that same fresh positive outlook to other group members.&nbsp; A rising tide raises all ships.&nbsp; So come join this rising tide of awesome people doing awesome things!&nbsp; Monroe Mann (Bio below, or Google him) and his fellow Break Divers will inspire you, encourage you, and force you to think in ways you never could have on your own.&nbsp; The result: your life is going to get a whole lot better. <br> <br><b>WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT AS A BREAK DIVING MEMBER:<\/b>&nbsp; <br>The basic framework of the group is meetings and get-togethers--inspirationally focused and moderated by motivational dynamo Monroe Mann, who many have called The Tony Robbins of the Entertainment World.&nbsp; Our meetings are ALWAYS inspiring; always hands-on and practical; always future focused (i.e. YOUR future); and often have an adventure portion to them, i.e. a Citibike adventure in NYC that starts with a motivational pow-wow and finishes with an invigorating kick in the pants.&nbsp; <br> <br>More specifically, each meeting has a three-part focus: <br><i> <br>FIRST:<\/i> we start off with a motivational topic introduced by the moderator, i.e. your goals over the next month or year; or thinking about your life's biggest problem and how to solve it; etc.&nbsp;<i> <br> <br>SECOND:<\/i> we have a workshop portion during which you can talk and interact with fellow members, discussing the particular topic introduced earlier.&nbsp; Sometimes the workshop may simply be sipping coffee and chatting, and at other times, it may be an outdoor activity like riding Citibikes or hiking, or doing some other fun activity like going to see a movie, or browsing the stacks at a bookstore. <br><i> <br>FINALLY:<\/i>&nbsp; each Meetup concludes with a final motivational pow-wow to go over solutions to whatever problems were introduced during the beginning of the meetup.&nbsp; During this time, everyone gets together and shares what they learned, and verbally and in writing, outlines their plans and to-do lists for the next few weeks or months. <br> <br>The idea is that each Meetup will leave you encouraged and motivated, armed with solutions to whatever issues you are facing, and a battle plan for the next few weeks to tackle your goals and dreams.&nbsp; More often than not, you'll also make new friendships and reinforce old ones. &nbsp; <br> <br>Regarding the activities: we might have writing workshops; we might meet at Broadway Dance Center; we might go for a walk in the park; we might go to Playland; we might simply meet for a chat to go over our one, three, and five year goals.&nbsp; THE ACTIVITIES ARE MERELY A MEANS TO AN END: the activity becomes a casual and fun way to allow the wisdom and inspiration of the pre\/post event pow-wows to percolate in your mind.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>Bottom line: the focus of Break Diving is simple--to guide one another to become our best by inspiring one another to overcome difficult challenges on the road to reaching our dreams.&nbsp; In other words, this Meetup group's purpose is to help inspire you to DIVE into this crazy world and FIND YOUR BREAKS AND OPPORTUNITIES.&nbsp; We want you to become... a Break Diver! <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Sound good?<\/b>&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>If so, come join our collective of winners!&nbsp; If you are ready to grab life by the horns and finally do what you know you were meant to do, welcome to your new home, and welcome... to the first day of the rest of your life.&nbsp; Note: Membership requires application and approval.&nbsp; If you already know two members, your application will be processed more easily. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>MODERATED BY:<\/b><\/p>\n<p> Monroe Mann, the founder of Break Diving, and a dude who epitomizes the philosophy of No Rules, No Excuses, No Regrets that he espouses.
