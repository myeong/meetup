Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us. Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!( <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Tuesday is Ollie's Bargain Nite at Camden Yards and Orioles tickets are only $14 each (with processing fees). The game on June 9 is against the Red Sox. The good tix might sell out, so we'll get ours in advance. Hope you can join us!<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------<\/p> <p>UPDATES:<\/p> <p>Here's some logistical info:<\/p> <p>1. We'll meet at 6:30 pm at the memorial at the corner of W. Lee Street and Ravens' Walk (the pedestrian walkway between M&amp;T Bank Stadium and Camden Yards). The memorial is inscribed \"Time Will Not Dim the Glory of Their Deeds\". The exact location is marked by the red (or green) thingy on this map:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?daddr=39.28206,-76.6207&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=17&amp;t=h\"><a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?daddr=39.28206,-76.6207&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=17&amp;t=h\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?daddr=39.28206,-76.6207&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=17&amp;t=h<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>2. I emailed my cell phone number to everyone.\u00a0 Please check your email, and if you don't have it, contact me at<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Md\/message\/?recipientId=5312826\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Md\/message\/?recipientId=5312826\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Md\/message\/?recipientId=5312826<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>3. At 6:35 pm SHARP, we'll head into the stadium.\u00a0 If you're running late, call me on my cell and we'll either wait a few minutes for you, or we'll head in and you'll have to wait outside the gate until I can come down and give you your ticket.<\/p> <p>4. You can park at the stadium for $8-$10.\u00a0 Bring cash.<\/p> <p>5. If anyone would like to carpool from the Laurel\/Columbia area, please let me know.<\/p> <p>6. You're allowed to bring your own snacks and unopened bottles of water and soda and into the stadium. Those are often nice to have.<\/p> <p>7. A baseball cap is a good idea. It shields your eyes from the overhead field lights and makes it easier to see.<\/p> <p>8. The weather for Tuesday night is looking promising--lower 80's with only a slight chance of rain.\u00a0 Note that our tix are under the roof, so we won't have a problem if there is a passing shower :-)<\/p> <p>See everyone Tuesday nite!<\/p>",

The Hathors, inter-dimensional beings, changed his life.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Suggested Donation $7\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Song of the New Earth<\/b> profiles the ardent quest of sound healer, psychotherapist and sonic shaman Tom Kenyon to integrate modern science and ancient mysticism through the power of sound. His rare ability to brilliantly decipher the healing science of sound results in a mesmerizing, and transformational documentary feature film.<\/p> <p>As an aspiring country musician, Kenyon was on way to fame and fortune in Nashville when a series of mystical experiences rocked his world. Desperate to understand his experience, he fervently dove into the study of neurophysiology to explain his unexplainable spiritual insights and continued his search through studying Tibetan Buddhism, Yoga, Taoism, mystical Christianity, Shamanism, Egyptian alchemy and more.<\/p> <p>From his home in the San Juan Islands to Tibetan nunneries in the Himalayas, from cathedrals and mysterious caves in southern France to the golden-chandeliered symphony halls of Vienna, Song of the New Earth explores the cutting edge scientific research proving that sound shifts brain states and can promote dramatic healing not only for ourselves but for our precious planet earth. With his wife Judi, often by his side, Kenyon explains how sound vibration speaks to our souls and bodies by opening a door that bridges our cognitive thinking; catapulting us towards insights into the miraculous. A transcendent, celestial experience that transports viewers through Kenyon\u2019s rare, divine gift.<\/p> <p>See the trailer and more at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/songofthenewearth.com\"><a href=\"http:\/\/songofthenewearth.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/songofthenewearth.com<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p>",

Although a $5-$10 donation is suggested, donations are not required for attendance.<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Each class will include:<\/b> guided meditation, instruction, opportunities to practice, and time for discussion, questions and answers.<\/p> <p><b>When and where:<\/b> We meet every Tuesday from 7:30-9:00 p.m. at Centennial High School, 4300 Centennial Lane, Ellicott City, MD, 21042, room 406. Please arrive early to settle into your seats - we start right at 7:30 p.m.<\/p> <p><b>We practice Insight Meditation<\/b>, a style of meditation that helps the mind attain deeper levels of calm concentration through sustained attention on the breath, then combines this with the crucial aspect of insight through contemplation of the mind and body and all of their changing and impermanent senses, emotions and thoughts. Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teacher:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a high school physics teacher who has been meditating for 25 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004. Stan is a mentor with the Insight Meditation Community of Washington (IMCW) and is a graduate of the Meditation Teacher Training Institute, a two-year certification program with senior Insight teachers Tara Brach, Jonathan Foust, Hugh Byrne, and Pat Coffey. He also teaches Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT).

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p><br\/>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>6. The group is not recommended for those under age 13.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please feel free to contact Stan Eisenstein at [masked] if you have any questions.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>",

Wheels rolling by 6:00. We will not wait past 6:00. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Pace:<\/b> Pace will be Intermediate, approx. 6.5 to 7 mph. Appropriate for average to riders, but not for beginners, or people who are not riding at least once a week. \u00a0Attitude is laid-back and friendly, but please ensure you can handle the pace and length of this ride before committing. This is a no-drop ride, i.e., we wait up for everyone at intersections. (Note: if you don\u2019t want to wait up for slower riders, this is NOT the ride for you, but please also survey your current fitness, as no one likes to be the one person holding up a larger group). \u00a0Please also note Ptap rides tend to be about 1 mph slower than Rosy, or Fairland, due terrain. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Terrain:<\/b> Ranges from Easy to Difficult. Most trails are in great shape, but plan on some mud spots. There are a few very steep climbs, rocks and technical sections, log overs (up to 10\" logs, and 3' stacks), tight single track (12\" wide in spots), and a stream crossing or two. \u00a0A strong\/advanced rider will be able to clean most sections, others will need to get off of their bikes in spots. \u00a0This is a friendly ride, so we will wait up for everyone, just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places. \u00a0This is a video edit I made from last fall through winter. \u00a0We won't hit all of this terrain, but gives you a feel for Patapsco:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Distance:<\/b>\u00a0With days getting longer we will be minimally getting 10 miles, and if conditions and light allow, we will push towards 20. \u00a0Exact route will change depending on group dynamics, trail conditions, daylight, etc. \u00a0I will typically have route planned in my head at the beginning of the ride, but will modify as needed to get us back at a reasonable time. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Duration:<\/b> I shoot to have us back before it gets dark (so 2 to 3 hours as the days get longer). \u00a0This can change with mechanical issues, and group dynamics though. \u00a0As this is a weekday ride, the stops will be just long enough for the last rider to catch their breath. \u00a0Note: wheels roll at stated time, so please don\u2019t be late.<\/p> <p><b>Bring:<\/b> Helmet (required), water (as much as you can carry), spare tube\/patch kit, pump\/CO2, multi-tool, I.D., emergency contact info where it can be easily located on your person, and a good attitude, as this ride is as much about camaraderie as it is about riding. Take a look at your bike and make sure it is in good working condition (Ptap will take its toll on the bike). \u00a0Bring a light, as you might need it. \u00a0There are ton of acceptable lights under $20 on Amazon right now. \u00a0Just look for a T6 Cree LED Bike light, with minimially 1000 lumens. \u00a0Here is a link to one: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006Y1FK18\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">Cheap 1000 lumen bike light<\/a>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B006QQX3C4\/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=3FJIG6WZ09712&amp;coliid=I15GIMB04YOTYI\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><b>Weather:<\/b> Shine Only (there will undoubtedly be some mud, but no ride if it\u2019s raining or the trails are too muddy).

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:<\/p> <p><br\/>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun! More information can be found at &lt;a&gt;www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com.&lt;\/a&gt; Hope to see you there!<\/p>",

This length of presentation allows for Q&amp;A time from those in attendance. The members are a friendly group and we welcome topic on Linux, IT security, and related fields of interest to the group.<\/p> <p><br\/>When there is not a presenter we hold an open discussion meeting for members to talk about any topic which comes up.<\/p> <p>Our meetings are held at the offices of OmniTI in Fulton, MD. From 6:30-7:00pm we enjoy some social time over pizza and soda provided by Tenable Network Security. The presentations start about 7pm and last until they are done. The meetings generally wind up about 9pm.<\/p> <p>If you are presenting at a Con, to your office, want to practice your public speaking, or just want to present on a topic that you are learning about please feel free to contact us. If you would like to give a presentation please contact Chuck Frain to arrange a meeting to present at.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nFor our June 10 meeting we will be welcoming Chris Tozzi and his presentation on the history of Free and Open Source Software.<\/p> <p><br\/>Chris Tozzi will discuss the history of the free and open-source software movements. Areas of emphasis will include the origins of \"hacker culture\" in the 1950s, the development of Unix starting in the 1960s, the founding of GNU and the Free Software Foundation in the 1980s, the emergence of Linux in the 1990s and the ways in which FOSS technologies have been adopted and expanded in diverse areas of the computing world since the early 2000s. The talk will also consider several key questions in the history of FOSS, including: What motivates free\/open source developers? Why did Linux succeed, while so many other \"free\" Unix clones gained comparatively little traction? Why has FOSS not completely displaced proprietary software? In which ways has FOSS influenced \"free culture\" and society more broadly?<\/p> <p><br\/>Chris Tozzi is an assistant professor of history at Howard University. He normally specializes in the history of France, but his summer project is to write a history of the free\/open-source software movement.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Abolish an ancient evil threatening devastation in this adventure for the world\u2019s greatest roleplaying game!<\/p> <p>Called by the Elder Elemental Eye to serve, four corrupt prophets have risen from the depths of anonymity to claim mighty weapons with direct links to the power of the elemental princes. Each of these prophets has assembled a cadre of cultists and creatures to serve them in the construction of four elemental temples of lethal design. It is up to adventurers from heroic factions such as the Emerald Enclave and the Order of the Gauntlet to discover where the true power of each prophet lay, and dismantle it before it comes boiling up to obliterate the Realms.<\/p> <p>Dungeon and Dragons Encounters run every Wednesday from 7pm - 9pm at the Collector's Corner Outpost in Bel Air Maryland. Grab your dice and your level 1-4 Adventure League character (or use a pre-gen) and join the adventure.<\/p>",

All of our problem situations start with poor, improper or even no communication with ourselves and with others. However, we are never really taught how to effectively communicate which creates that barrier to getting what we want whether from our jobs, our relationships and even ourselves. Bob\u2019s message of Communicating To Win helps one break through those barriers and empower themselves to achieve more.\u00a0 His book<a href=\"http:\/\/bobpaff.com\/ctw\"> Communicating To Win In Life, Love, and Business<\/a> serves as a guide in which he utilizes his experiences, both personal and professional, to empower, motivate, and enlighten people in ways to which they can communicate successfully.<\/p> <p><i>Bob Paff is a highly sought after motivational speaker, business leader and seasoned media professional speaking to prominent institutions such as Johns Hopkins University Hospital and PNC Bank as well as having shows and segments on CBS Radio, Fox, ABC and being a guest on the Steve Harvey show.<br\/><\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>Every month, The Baltimore\/Washington PowerTeam features a special guest speaker delivering content on a variety of topics of interest to high performers like you. Health and fitness, nutrition, finances, relationships, careers, overall mental well-being \u2013 we cover it all. Plus our outstanding peer group offers the support, encouragement \u2013 and accountability \u2013 to help you stay on course toward the life you want to lead. Make plans to join us at our next meeting and help spread the word to others who would benefit from the value we provide!<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Meeting dates are usually the 2nd Wednesday of each month -- or as announced when conflicts arise. (See below)<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Please RSVP to me at '[masked]' if you can make it or contact me at[masked] if you have any questions or concerns.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Guests are always welcome and we'd appreciate a donation of $5 or $10 to help build our charitable budget. In past years, your generosity has helped us feed more than 2,000 local residents at-risk during our Basket Brigade annual food drives. In addition, we've also fed and cared for a number of local homeless people through our Backpacks For The Homeless initiative. Thanks to your help, we'll do even more this year!<\/p> <p><br\/>Rest assured, we strive to give PowerTeam members an outstanding return on their investment of time and effort at every meeting. That means more social and volunteer activities. More personally relevant content. More skill and mastermind sessions. More goal setting. More support and accountability. If you know of a great presenter you'd like to recommend for an upcoming meeting, please let me know \u2013 we're always open to new guests who provide value.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Mark your calendars for these upcoming 2015 meeting dates:<br\/>July 8 \u2022 August 12 \u2022 September 9 \u2022 October 7 \u2022 November 11<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>No December meeting due to Date With Destiny.<br\/>Holiday party plans to be announced.<\/p> <p><br\/>We hope to see you all at a meeting or event soon.

Look under permits at the WSSC website located here\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsscwater.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsscwater.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.wsscwater.com<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>There are TWO rental kayaks available for this paddle at the weeknight price of $25.00. Please be sure to answer the rental question when you RSVP to request one. \u00a0The first two people to request a boat get them.<\/p>",

FUN!<\/p> <p>However, since each workout program is intentionally different to alleviate boredom and to give you maximum results in minimum time its difficult to describe a \"typical day.\" You can expect some light running, resistance training, obstacle courses, core, body weight, and team training. On some days, you will hike, crawl, lunge, and have a fun time while burning a ton of fat and meeting new people. It's always an adventure! These 1 hour workouts are design to provide a total body workout, in half the time!<\/p> <p>Can wait to see you at the next session!<\/p>",

Faxon has betrayed their plans.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\u201cWe are limitless in number!\u201d Faxon boasted. \u201cOur witches can transform the weakest of your rabble into demonlings! You cannot defeat us!\u201d Apparently, witches in the cult are transforming ordinary citizens into demons and setting them loose upon the populace. Now that you know this, you can end this plot\u2026 by ending the witches\u2019 lives.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>While the Herald of Iomedae is keeping Faxon captive in the high Watchtower, you and your companions must search the marketplaces and manors of the central district of Kenabres. If you can find the summoner at the center of this cult, you can disrupt his plot. But beware! His adepts can summon demons as well. You won\u2019t know of their presence until they suddenly appear behind you.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>A new companion has joined your quest. Sosiel Vaenic, a priest of Shelyn at the Temple of the Eternal Rose, will come with you to begin your inquisition. He is unassailable in his allegiance to the cause of Queen Galfrey. Although you are certain of Sosiel\u2019s devotion, loyalty is a grave concern. Right now, you don\u2019t know who you can trust. If the cultists have the ability to transform people and animals into demonlings, they can transform your allies into demonlings as well. Rely on yourselves, but keep your friends close.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play, as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we are sure we have space for, but if there is more interest, we can almost certainly make more room. So please sign up for the wait list if you want to play.<\/p> <p>3.

The class will be monitored by LouAnn, a certified medium, hypnotherapist and Reiki Master Teacher. Suggestions for topics to strengthen your spirit connection will be offered, however, consensus of the group may determine what is offered in any particular class. All levels of experience are welcome -- from curious to beginner to advanced -- as we are all in the process of teaching and learning.<\/p> <p>We will be using guidance and concepts from teachers such as Sharon Klingler, John Edward, Rose Vanden Eynden, Lisa Williams, James Van Praagh, Tony Stockwell and many more. Remember, there is no certain or direct path to spirit communication. Each person has their own strengths that they bring to the process.<\/p> <p>The fee for this class is $20.00. You may pay by cash or check at the class, or if you prefer to use a credit card, you may pay on Paypal. Our account is serenityguides @ yahoo.com.<\/p> <p>Please RSVP on this meetup page.

She locks her huge brown eyes with a client\u2019s and asks directly, but respectfully, \u201cDo you really need this? Why? How does it make you feel when I take it away?\u201d And very occasionally, when a person seems unreasonably attached to a shopping bag of old birthday cards or an ugly ashtray pilfered from a restaurant in Greece, she pulls out the tough love: \u201cAre you going to give me trouble with this?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>As the host of the Discovery Home Channel\u2019s hit show\u00a0Neat, Buttigieg provides clutter control and guidance to a new household every week. She\u2019s something between an organizer and a headshrinker, with certifications as a professional organizer and as a life coach. She simultaneously cleans out closets while slowly uncovering subconscious \u201cblocks\u201d that make a person want to hoard junk or prevent them from putting their dirty clothes in the hamper.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Her gentle leadership made a lifelong fan out of client Denise Fujiwara, who says Buttigieg \u201cis a living example of what you can do with an affirmative attitude.\u201d The Toronto-based choreographer was lost trying to sort out her home office to make room for a house renovation when she called in Buttigieg to help. As someone who runs her own choreography business and dance troupe, Fujiwara\u2019s office is prone to clutter. \u201cMy office was a horrendous mess,\u201d she says. She describes stacks of boxes, piles of unfiled papers, photographs, video tapes, press releases \u2013 essentially 15 years\u2019 worth of disorder and confusion.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d tried to sort it out in the past, but I hadn\u2019t had the skills to do it properly until I worked with Hellen. In about 6 hours, she did what I couldn\u2019t do in 15 years,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The two went around the room in an orderly way, starting at the door and working clockwise. \u201cOccasionally, I\u2019d get stuck on something, and she\u2019d push me to make a decision,\u201d says Fujiwara. \u201cShe pushed through, and in the end I felt euphoric to be relieved of all that stuff.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg unloads stuff with a dancer\u2019s grace and a politician\u2019s diplomacy. Anyone would think she was born taking charge of people\u2019s unruly environs, teaching them how to be better organized. In a way, that\u2019s true. She says she was always organized, even as a teenager, when most kids live among piles of laundry, music collections and notebooks. She was also always a confident speaker. In grammar school, she was the girl who narrated the school plays.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In fact, Buttigieg moves and speaks so naturally in front of the camera and with such calm assertiveness, no one would guess that not long ago she was at a loss for what to do with her life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI had been out of the workforce for almost 10 years as a stay-at-home mom, but I lacked confidence, and I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she says from her home in Oakville, a suburb of Toronto, Canada.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She graduated from Seneca College in Toronto with a degree in radio and television broadcasting, and worked briefly as an administrator and fitness instructor. But then she had two children and took off nearly 10 years from work to raise them. Those 10 years at home had slowly whittled away her confidence as a businessperson, but she still wanted to launch a new career \u2013 and have some adult conversation. Her solution? In 1999, she joined City Centre Toastmasters.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cToastmasters changed my life,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She means that in the most literal sense. It started with one of the first lessons any new Toastmaster learns: talk about what you know. Buttigieg started writing speeches about what she knew, and as someone who was naturally neat, she talked about organizing. And then at one contest she gave a speech called \u201cSimple Simon\u201d about simplifying your life by letting go of clutter, and it launched a new career.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cGiving speeches is a journey of self-discovery,\u201d she says. \u201cHow often in life do people really listen to us? At Toastmasters, people are truly listening; they\u2019re not thinking about what they\u2019ll say back. It\u2019s a safe place to speak, so I could use my speeches to work out what resonated with the audience.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>And also what resonated with her. That speech was the nugget that now sits at the center of her professional life. In fact, she still uses parts of the same speech today when she gives presentations: \u201cIf you would like to get a taste of the simple life, don\u2019t let\u00a0stuff\u00a0complicate it. Commit to following these three simple steps: If you don\u2019t use it, lose it; if you don\u2019t need it, don\u2019t buy it; and when you bring one item in, take one item out.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>This would become her mantra in several ways. It sparked her desire to become a life coach and also tapped into her abilities as an organizer. Starting her own organizing business, called WeOrganizeU, helped pay for the life-coaching certification. Soon, a group of producers approached her about a new show that would blend her gifts for tidying up with her ability to lead people, and by 2004\u00a0Neat\u00a0hit the North American airwaves.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg credits Toastmasters with more than just sparking a good idea; she also says she honed her skills as a leader and built confidence. Shalini Alleluia, president of City Centre Toastmasters, says Buttigieg faced a short learning curve thanks to her take-charge attitude.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cHellen had lots of energy and was articulate and vibrant,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe always smiled and was willing to try anything.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Alleluia says even though Buttigieg was a new member, she asked her to chair a speech contest and encouraged her to assume meeting roles. Soon Buttigieg was helping others to be better speakers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI think Hellen was more of a mentor to other people than other people being a mentor to her,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe has a charisma that makes people want to follow her and to be like her in personality and capability. She\u2019s a good listener, and she always pays attention to the evaluation notes. I once told her she was very loud and didn\u2019t have expression in her delivery, and she really listened.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Like any good Toastmaster, Buttigieg is still seeking advice on how to improve. She still asks Alleluia for feedback on her presentations and episodes of the TV show. \u201cI\u2019m honest, and I\u2019ll tell her what I thought the show lacked or what I learned,\u201d says Alleluia.\u00a0<\/p> <p>While Alleluia coaches Buttigieg to improve some public speaking skills, her student is working toward a broader purpose. \u201cI\u2019m a teacher,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel that whether I\u2019m organizing or coaching or speaking, there\u2019s still that element of wanting to pass on the information I know to improve other people\u2019s lives.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\nRead The\u00a0Toastmaster\u00a0on Your iPad!<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/iPadMag\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/iPadMag<\/a> Access the Toastmasters International iPad\u00ae app by following these steps:<\/p> <p>1.

She locks her huge brown eyes with a client\u2019s and asks directly, but respectfully, \u201cDo you really need this? Why? How does it make you feel when I take it away?\u201d And very occasionally, when a person seems unreasonably attached to a shopping bag of old birthday cards or an ugly ashtray pilfered from a restaurant in Greece, she pulls out the tough love: \u201cAre you going to give me trouble with this?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>As the host of the Discovery Home Channel\u2019s hit show\u00a0Neat, Buttigieg provides clutter control and guidance to a new household every week. She\u2019s something between an organizer and a headshrinker, with certifications as a professional organizer and as a life coach. She simultaneously cleans out closets while slowly uncovering subconscious \u201cblocks\u201d that make a person want to hoard junk or prevent them from putting their dirty clothes in the hamper.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Her gentle leadership made a lifelong fan out of client Denise Fujiwara, who says Buttigieg \u201cis a living example of what you can do with an affirmative attitude.\u201d The Toronto-based choreographer was lost trying to sort out her home office to make room for a house renovation when she called in Buttigieg to help. As someone who runs her own choreography business and dance troupe, Fujiwara\u2019s office is prone to clutter. \u201cMy office was a horrendous mess,\u201d she says. She describes stacks of boxes, piles of unfiled papers, photographs, video tapes, press releases \u2013 essentially 15 years\u2019 worth of disorder and confusion.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d tried to sort it out in the past, but I hadn\u2019t had the skills to do it properly until I worked with Hellen. In about 6 hours, she did what I couldn\u2019t do in 15 years,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The two went around the room in an orderly way, starting at the door and working clockwise. \u201cOccasionally, I\u2019d get stuck on something, and she\u2019d push me to make a decision,\u201d says Fujiwara. \u201cShe pushed through, and in the end I felt euphoric to be relieved of all that stuff.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg unloads stuff with a dancer\u2019s grace and a politician\u2019s diplomacy. Anyone would think she was born taking charge of people\u2019s unruly environs, teaching them how to be better organized. In a way, that\u2019s true. She says she was always organized, even as a teenager, when most kids live among piles of laundry, music collections and notebooks. She was also always a confident speaker. In grammar school, she was the girl who narrated the school plays.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In fact, Buttigieg moves and speaks so naturally in front of the camera and with such calm assertiveness, no one would guess that not long ago she was at a loss for what to do with her life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI had been out of the workforce for almost 10 years as a stay-at-home mom, but I lacked confidence, and I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she says from her home in Oakville, a suburb of Toronto, Canada.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She graduated from Seneca College in Toronto with a degree in radio and television broadcasting, and worked briefly as an administrator and fitness instructor. But then she had two children and took off nearly 10 years from work to raise them. Those 10 years at home had slowly whittled away her confidence as a businessperson, but she still wanted to launch a new career \u2013 and have some adult conversation. Her solution? In 1999, she joined City Centre Toastmasters.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cToastmasters changed my life,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She means that in the most literal sense. It started with one of the first lessons any new Toastmaster learns: talk about what you know. Buttigieg started writing speeches about what she knew, and as someone who was naturally neat, she talked about organizing. And then at one contest she gave a speech called \u201cSimple Simon\u201d about simplifying your life by letting go of clutter, and it launched a new career.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cGiving speeches is a journey of self-discovery,\u201d she says. \u201cHow often in life do people really listen to us? At Toastmasters, people are truly listening; they\u2019re not thinking about what they\u2019ll say back. It\u2019s a safe place to speak, so I could use my speeches to work out what resonated with the audience.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>And also what resonated with her. That speech was the nugget that now sits at the center of her professional life. In fact, she still uses parts of the same speech today when she gives presentations: \u201cIf you would like to get a taste of the simple life, don\u2019t let\u00a0stuff\u00a0complicate it. Commit to following these three simple steps: If you don\u2019t use it, lose it; if you don\u2019t need it, don\u2019t buy it; and when you bring one item in, take one item out.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>This would become her mantra in several ways. It sparked her desire to become a life coach and also tapped into her abilities as an organizer. Starting her own organizing business, called WeOrganizeU, helped pay for the life-coaching certification. Soon, a group of producers approached her about a new show that would blend her gifts for tidying up with her ability to lead people, and by 2004\u00a0Neat\u00a0hit the North American airwaves.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg credits Toastmasters with more than just sparking a good idea; she also says she honed her skills as a leader and built confidence. Shalini Alleluia, president of City Centre Toastmasters, says Buttigieg faced a short learning curve thanks to her take-charge attitude.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cHellen had lots of energy and was articulate and vibrant,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe always smiled and was willing to try anything.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Alleluia says even though Buttigieg was a new member, she asked her to chair a speech contest and encouraged her to assume meeting roles. Soon Buttigieg was helping others to be better speakers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI think Hellen was more of a mentor to other people than other people being a mentor to her,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe has a charisma that makes people want to follow her and to be like her in personality and capability. She\u2019s a good listener, and she always pays attention to the evaluation notes. I once told her she was very loud and didn\u2019t have expression in her delivery, and she really listened.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Like any good Toastmaster, Buttigieg is still seeking advice on how to improve. She still asks Alleluia for feedback on her presentations and episodes of the TV show. \u201cI\u2019m honest, and I\u2019ll tell her what I thought the show lacked or what I learned,\u201d says Alleluia.\u00a0<\/p> <p>While Alleluia coaches Buttigieg to improve some public speaking skills, her student is working toward a broader purpose. \u201cI\u2019m a teacher,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel that whether I\u2019m organizing or coaching or speaking, there\u2019s still that element of wanting to pass on the information I know to improve other people\u2019s lives.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\nRead The\u00a0Toastmaster\u00a0on Your iPad!<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/iPadMag\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/iPadMag<\/a> Access the Toastmasters International iPad\u00ae app by following these steps:<\/p> <p>1.

His best friend is too burnt out to provide any coherent speculation; his sister has gone goth; his ex-girlfriend has recently been institutionalized; and his other friends are too inebriated to give him any sort of solace. But a chance meeting with an artistic kid, the target of this group's bullying, offers CB a peace of mind and sets in motion a friendship that will push teen angst to the very limits. Drug use, suicide, eating disorders, teen violence, rebellion and sexual identity collide and careen toward an ending that's both haunting and hopeful.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Twenty-two years after the events of Jurassic Park, Isla Nublar now features a fully functioning dinosaur theme park, Jurassic World, as originally envisioned by John Hammond. This new park is owned by the Masrani Corporation. Owen (Chris Pratt), a member of Jurassic World's on-site staff, conducts behavioral research on the Velociraptors. After many years, Jurassic World's attendance rates begin to decline and a new attraction, created to re-spark visitor interest, gravely backfires when a genetically-modified dinosaur gets loose.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-U_oUvwmqX4\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-U_oUvwmqX4<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/RFinNxS5KN4\" class=\"embedded\">http:\/\/youtu.be\/RFinNxS5KN4<\/a><\/p>",

The titles of his presentations are: \"Science and Belief in a Contingent Universe\", Friday, June 12, 2015 at 7:30 p.m., and \"Ecological Metaphysics: Room for a Creator\", Saturday, June 13, 2015 at 10:30 a.m. These talks tend to have a religious philosophical theme about the relationship of science and religion, so atheists who have no tolerance of religious apologists may want to skip it.<\/p>",

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun! More information can be found at &lt;a&gt;www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com.&lt;\/a&gt; Hope to see you there!<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>The weekend of the 13th and 14th I will lead a hike on the John P Saylor Trail in Pennsylvania. The John Saylor trail is a pleasant little trail in central PA to the east of Johnstown in the Gallitzin State Forest. It is a figure eight composed of two loops (one being smaller than the other) and is your typical Pennsylvania forest walk on the Allegheny Plateau thru beautiful forest. In some ways it is a smaller version of the Allegheny Front Trail. The terrain is relatively easy and being on the plateau it will be a little cooler than DC.<br\/>We will start from the Lost Turkey Trail parking on Route 56 and hike counter clockwise to the bridge over clear shade creek that connects to the smaller loop. The area around the bridge is very scenic with Hemlock trees and a beaver dam. From there we will hike the smaller loop. We\u2019ll shoot for a nice meadow campsite at the far end of the far loop, complete with picnic table and an old Adirondack shelter (tent recommended). There should be reliable water within \u00bd mile of the shelter. Depending on the pace of the group we may keep going and camp at clear shade creek. Sunday we finish up and should be out before lunch and head for a good meal on the way home.

We'll start kayaking at 10 when they open. I want to get there before the crowd and before it gets hot.<\/p> <p>You can bring your own kayak and put in on the beach. They also rent kayaks for hourly and daily rates. Check the site for details. I think it is $20\/hr for a sit-in kayak and $15\/hr for a sit on top kayak. PFD and paddle are included.<\/p> <p>The max they will charge you is for 3 hours. I plan to be out for a long time and make the best use of my rental cost. :)<\/p> <p>This is a flat water kayaking event. There are two paths we can take. Head East then North to go around the peninsula and head toward the Hammerman Beach location. If we hug the coast it is about 12 miles of total distance. If we make a bee line it is about 10 miles and about 3.5 hours. We'll go as far as the group is comfortable and has time for. There is lots of great wild life to see on the way. Last time I saw an entire family of foxes this direction.<\/p> <p>Or we can go South and meander along various coastlines that look to be inhabited and built up and make it to Middle River Airport. Also about 8-10 miles round trip.<\/p> <p>Bring a hat, water, sunscreen and clothes you don't mind getting dirty and wet. And don't bring your phones unless you have a well sealed bag for it. I killed a cell phone last year that was in two ziploc bags.<\/p> <p>There will be a post-kayak lunch at Double T diner at the intersection of Ebenezer and Rte 40.<\/p> <p>This is cross posted with the 20s\/30s hiking around Maryland group.<\/p>",

Any healing that happens occurs because of the work of these benevolent spirits. Use of the crystal bed is often prescribed by the Healing Spirits at the Casa.

You rest face up, eyes closed, bathing in energy for 40 minutes while the Healing Spirits do all the work. You may fall asleep and wake refreshed; have insights and emotional releases; feel warmth, movement, expansion, cleansing or sense of being touched; or feel the Healing Spirits working directly on your physical body.<\/p> <p>Each healing is a personal and transforming process that unfolds over time.

We have been there before, and it was a great hit with all the members. The skippers will stay overnight at\u00a0Mears, Great Oak \u00a0Landing Marina which has a pool, restaurant,\u00a0 tiki bar on the beach, and\u00a0music on Sat. night.<\/p> <p>We have\u00a0arranged space at the motel to allow for additional crew who cannot stay on board, due to limited berths available for sleeping on the boats. Note that there may be as many as four in\u00a0each motel room.<\/p> <p>Skippers will be departing their marinas on Saturday morning and returning by Sunday evening.<\/p> <p>The Great Oak Landing Marina is really a resort area with a golf course, tennis courts, live music on Sat night, etc., so they charge a high fee for an overnight slip. So\u00a0to share the cost of this fee the CSA must charge each member a $45 fee for this cruise. \u00a0If you want to let skippers know of your desire to go on this cruise, please RSVP here now,\u00a0and\u00a0send a check\u00a0to Diane Derr made out to CSA. (You will be sent\u00a0the address when you RSVP). We have had a good response from the skippers, and expect several boats to join this cruise; however, we don't know the exact number of boats available yet, so the number of RSVP's is unlimited. A balanced crew will consist of new club members, those who haven't cruised in a while and those with sailing and\/or cruising experience. If it turns out that we cannot accommodate you, we will refund your payment. RSVP's will close 10 days before the event.<\/p> <p>We will plan a cookout on the outdoor grilles at the resort, and will need to coordinate food for the cookout. This will be determined after we know who is actually going.<\/p> <p>This event is for paid CSA Organization members only. If you're not a current member, you can join and pay your dues by going to the \"more\" menu -\"Files\" submenu, download, complete and submit a membership form. Also, you can\u00a0pay your $40 annual dues by sending a check made out to CSA to the address on the form.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>- I am trying to work out a discount for our group to help offset the $4 cost to enter the park, which must be paid in cash.<\/p> <p>Come spend a relaxing afternoon kayaking on the flatwater at Gunpowder Falls State Park. This will be the fifth year I have done this event and it is always a lot of fun. Rent \"sit on top\" kayaks for one hour, two hours, or the entire day and explore the waters with the group, or venture off on your own. If you are interested you can also rent wind surfers, Catamarans, and Stand Up Paddleboards. Prices and directions can be found on the website, but if you rent a two-person kayak it will be about 20 dollars each for two hours. While exploring the water trails we often see beavers, osprey, blue herons, and sometimes eagles. After we spend some time getting exercise, we can head over to the Sunset Cove and have some food on the water while listening to live music. I recommend bringing a change of clothing, water, sun screen, and going potty before getting on the water since it is illegal to beach the kayak anywhere but the park.<\/p> <p>- We usually go out for a couple of hours, but you can go for more or less if you want, and then head to Sunset Cove for lunch. Sunset Cove is an outside bar\/restaurant located in Essex. People who own their own kayaks are welcome to bring them as well. We will be meeting at 10:30 by the picnic tables next to the kayak rental area.<\/p> <p>Doug<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ultimatewa\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ultimatewa<\/a>...<\/p>",

The route includes scenic Spa Creek and Back Creek, as well as Ego Alley by City Dock where all the tourists hang out.\u00a0For one affordable afternoon, you can enjoy the same Annapolis waterfront ambience as the rich folks hanging out on their million-dollar yachts.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Annapolis Canoe &amp; Kayak on Spa Creek will again be our base for rentals and launching kayaks. For those launching elsewhere, we'll all meet at the ACK dock on Spa Creek around 11:30 am.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/6\/2\/600_434965442.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/8\/f\/600_434965487.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Meetup Details<\/b><\/p> <p>Gather at the ACK store at 11:00 am to fill out rental forms, pick up gear, and walk down to the dock where the ACK staff will get people launched safely.\u00a0Renters can make advance reservations by phone and pick up their equipment at the store.\u00a0<\/p> <p>People who have their own kayaks can launch them from the ACK floating platform dock or the nearby public beach launch on Spa Creek at the end of First Street where street parking is generally available. ACK permits SHR kayak owners to launch for free from their dock. Just be careful not to get in the way of the staff handling rental boats.<\/p> <p>Everyone should be in their boats and ready to paddle around 11:30 am, so be on time. We'll assemble on the water as a group by the ACK dock to began our paddle up Spa Creek.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/0\/a\/600_434965354.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/2\/8\/600_434965384.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The ACK store is located in the heart of Eastport which is\u00a0a crowded residential area with limited street parking and little room for unloading kayaks.\u00a0Even if you own a boat, you should consider renting a kayak from ACK to avoid parking and unloading hassles. They have quality boats already on the dock and their staff will get you launched safely.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Total paddling distance will be approximately seven miles and should take about three hours. Bring a wide-brim hat, sunscreen, and plenty of cold water to stay hydrated.<\/p> <p><b>Skill Level<\/b><\/p> <p>This event is suitable for anyone with basic kayaking skills who feels comfortable paddling in close proximity to the larger boats that use Annapolis harbor.\u00a0Spa Creek and Back Creek are\u00a0home to many power boats and sailing yachts that can create wakes and wave turbulence.\u00a0You should expect to encounter some choppy water and swells along the way. Stay to one side away from the main channel so you don't get run over by large boats that can't see kayaks or maneuver around them.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/f\/5\/2\/600_435076210.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>ALL PARTICIPANTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL SAFETY<\/b><\/p> <p>Our group of recreational kayakers look out for each other, but we're not certified experts at rescuing novices. SHR paddle events have been very successful because we stick together in case anyone needs assistance. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Rental Details<\/b><\/p> <p>As a well-known kayak vendor, ACK maintains a large fleet of quality rental kayaks.\u00a0Advance full-day kayak reservations can be made with a credit card by calling ACK directly at[masked]-2303.<\/p> <p>Making a full-day advance reservation costs $50 for a plastic kayak and guarantees that you will have your chosen boat when you arrive. It's also the best value since\u00a0the hourly rate is $20 and we're likely to be paddling for three hours. Rentals include a paddle and life jacket. Composite rental kayaks cost $25 per hour.<\/p> <p>Complete information can be found on the ACK website:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.annapoliscanoeandkayak.com\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.annapoliscanoeandkayak.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.annapoliscanoeandkayak.com<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/3\/c\/600_434965404.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Afterwards at the Boatyard Bar &amp; Grill<\/b><\/p> <p>The Boatyard Bar &amp; Grill is a great place to eat, drink, and hang out just one block from the ACK store. Our SHR group goes there often and always has a good time.\u00a0Check it out:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-boatyard-bar-and-grill-annapolis\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-boatyard-bar-and-grill-annapolis<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/e\/5\/e\/600_435075966.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Weather Considerations<\/b><\/p> <p>This event depends upon good kayaking weather. I'll post a notice and send out an email by 9:00 am if we need to change plans or cancel. A little rain is okay and can add to the adventure. But we won't paddle in dangerous conditions such as lightning, high winds, or excessive heat.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Call Jake at[masked] with any questions. I can't always answer my phone at events, but you can try.<\/p> <p><b>Driving Directions<\/b><\/p> <p>Don't trust your GPS going to Eastport. It will most likely direct you through the crowded streets of downtown Annapolis. Here's the best route coming from the Washington or Baltimore area.<\/p> <p>From Rt 50 East, take Exit 22 (Aris T. Allen Blvd\/MD 665) and stay straight on MD 665. After about a mile, the road name changes to Forest Drive.\u00a0Keep going straight on Forest Drive and turn left onto Hilltop Lane at the traffic light just past the Safeway. \u00a0Then follow Hilltop Lane (which changes name to Tyler Ave) straight all the way to the light at Bay Ridge Ave.<\/p> <p>Turn left onto Bay Ridge Ave and keep going as it bears right onto Chesapeake Ave at the Eastport shopping plaza. Drive down Chesapeake Ave for several blocks and turn left onto 4th St to Severn Ave. Take a right on Severn for one block to 3rd St. The ACK store is on the left corner and street parking is usually available nearby.<\/p> <p>The Eastport neighborhood has several one-way streets. Check the Google meetup map above to familiarize yourself with the street layout.<\/p> <p>I hope to see you there!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/0\/4\/d\/600_435076461.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

Beginner kayakers are provided kayaking instruction and skill building tips in a safe and controlled environment in one of our beautiful park pools. Not a beginner and just want to practice? We can go over the basics of rescue techniques and wet exits. We will be at the Cherry Hill Splash Park every Saturday from 1-3 pm there is a $2 general admission to enter the pool. Some folks just need a 15 min refresher and others want to just hang out at the pool. We recommend you bring a chair and what ever else you need to spend the afternoon at the pool. There is a 3 story spiral water slide at this pool(FYI)! Please come dressed to swim in the pool!<\/p> <p>Participants must be 50 pounds and up and children under 18 must be accompanied by a parent to kayak. RESERVATIONS ARE RECOMMENDED.<\/p>",

Growing up on a pretty conventional, standard diet of processed, convenience and refined foods, I had a lot of work to do as an adult. I began to take back my health after being diagnosed with high cholesterol and being over weight.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In this monthly meetup,\u00a0we want to offer up information, along with a heaping dose of grace. We will celebrate small changes, the little victories we make in being healthier.\u00a0Food should be enjoyable and not a difficult or stressful thing.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you just want to learn how to add something different to your \"same old same old\" weekly menu, please come out and join us as well.\u00a0The best part...we get to eat what we cook (YES!).<\/p> <p>I will ask that all who RSVP bring an ingredient for the recipe(s) of the month. I will send a message to all the week of the event letting them know what to bring.<\/p> <p>First up vegetable lasagna and zucchini ravioli with side salad and strawberry lemonade.<\/p>",

Yet unfortunately for them, the tribe member responsible for the discovery has already been exiled for the abhorrent crime of writing (which every goblin knows steals words from your head). To remedy this situation, the Licktoads\u2019 leader, His Mighty Girthness Chief Rendwattle Gutwad, has declared that the greatest heroes of the tribe must venture forth to retrieve the rest of the fireworks from a derelict ship stranded in the marsh. In order to prove themselves as the Licktoads\u2019 bravest goblins, the PCs must complete a series of dangerous dares, from swallowing bull slugs and braving the dreaded Earbiter to dancing with Squealy Nord himself. Yet even once they\u2019ve proven their mettle, the adventure is just beginning. For the ship in question is far from uninhabited, and Vorka the cannibal goblin would like nothing better than a few tasty visitors....<\/p> <p>\n\n\nREPLAYABLE AT LEVEL 1<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Hello Ladies,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s worship the Lord in song, a sing a long that is! We all know that music is a powerful ministry. Whether we are going through a difficult time or if we need some encouragement, Christian music helps us to focus our energy on God, what he has done and what that means for us as his daughters. Me and Nene compiled songs below that we would like to sing, but feel free to add songs (with artist name) to the list (in the comments section). We will have the songs playing from a t.v. and will also have the lyrics displayed. We will begin the evening with some fellowship and food and then start the sing along. (We will most likely ask the person who selected the song why they selected it.) This meet up will be at my apartment in Laurel. Will send the address next week. Parking is available, no parking sticker\/paper needed. My number is[masked]-0651. Here are a few songs we will sing:<\/p> <p>Jamie Grace-I Love The Way you Hold Me\u00a0<\/p> <p>Francesca Battistelli-He Knows my Name\u00a0<\/p> <p>Capital Kings \u2013 You\u2019ll Never Be Alone\u00a0<\/p> <p>Colton Dixon-More of You<\/p> <p>\u00a0Matt Maher-All the People Say Amen\u00a0<\/p> <p>Mandisa \u2013 Overcomer<\/p> <p>\u00a0Kari Jobe \u2013 I am not Alone\u00a0<\/p> <p>Newsboys-God\u2019s Not Dead<\/p> <p>\u00a0Steven Curtis Chapman-Do Everything<\/p> <p>\u00a0Third Day-Children of God<\/p> <p>Big Daddy Weave -Yours will be\u00a0<\/p> <p>Hillsong-Here I am to\u00a0Worship<\/p> <p>William\u00a0McDowell -\u00a0I Give Myself Away\u00a0<\/p> <p>Matt Redman-\u00a0The Heart of Worship \u00a0<\/p> <p>Maranatha music-Open\u00a0the Eyes of My Heart<\/p> <p>Michael W.

It is not being mentored by HCPG, however, it is being communicated to present you with a potential shooting opportunity.<\/b><\/p> <p>If you have never been to an AVAM Kinetic Sculpture Race, this is the year to go. This is an event that is chock full of photo opps - from the staging area at the museum itself, watching them on Key Highway across from the museum, and stopping off at either the Canton Water Park area where they rest or at Patterson Park. We've gone for several years now. This year we've already planned to bring lawn chairs and a cooler and head for Patterson Park after they have left the staging area.<\/p> <p><br\/>Anyone is welcome to join us. It's a fun event for kids. Lots of people even dress up. This is a fun event.

        "description": "<p>The Baltimore Kinetic Sculpture Race is an annual free event in Baltimore's Inner Harbor area. \u00a0If you haven't been or haven't heard of this fun event, here's the website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kineticbaltimore.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.kineticbaltimore.com\/<\/a> I thought it'd be fun to meet up and check out the various race participant's movable bike sculptures and then ride along the route event to watch as the race unfolds. Bring your camera and\/or smartphone to take pictures. We'll stop and watch the water event at Caton Waterfront Park, where there is also restrooms and food vendors. The water event lasts a couple hours (11:15-1:15), as the race participants have to enter the water, paddle around a short pier and then climb back up the steep boat ramp. It's fun to see how the vehicles either make or break during this event. Brompton Club members can stay as long or short as you want for this ride event. The whole route is about 15 miles. The ride to Caton Waterfront Park is probably half of that. The event continues on to a obstacle course at Patterson Park. Although it's a little interesting to watch the participants grind their way over sand and mud, it's quite slow, so I suggest we head back to the Visionary Art Museum after watching the waterfront event. Take a look at the website and let me know if you'd like to join me. There are a number of parking garages located around the Inner Harbor, where you can park for the day (for $15-$20). Rain will cancel our attending this event, and I will reschedule another ride later in the month. Thanks!<\/p>",

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\". That way, we know not to be waiting for you. Thanks.<\/b><\/p> <p>So come join us on Sunday for a brisk walk in the park. It's a great way to clean out the cobwebs and start a Sunday.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>We had this meet-up scheduled earlier but canceled due to the riots in Baltimore. The 17th annual Baltimore Kinetic Sculpture Race has been rescheduled for Sunday, June 14, starting at 11am. The museum's staff worked closely with city officials to secure a new date for it's annual competition of human-powered works of art, which has always been dedicated to the delight, communal participation, peace and love of our City. This year's race will be sporting an \"Out of This World\" theme in tribute to The Hubble Space Telescope, which recently celebrated its 25th anniversary at AVAM among many other locations. Mega THANKS to our Maryland State Delegates, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and her staff, Baltimore City Police, Baltimore Office of Promotions and the Arts, Baltimore's Department of Recreation and Parks, Kinetic racers, volunteers, sponsors &amp; fans, the generous organizers of Tour dem Parks, AVAM's staff, and all who worked diligently to help us declare: The RACE is ON! You can go here for more details: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.avam.org\/news-and-events\/events\/kinetic-sculpture-race.shtml\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.avam.org\/news-and-events\/events\/kinetic-sculpture-race.shtml<\/a> Matt Hoffman will serve as coordinator, Melanie Lynn will be asst. coordinator. You should direct questions to the two of them (not sure if I'm going to be there or not yet--I currently have a conflict). The race starts at 11 but I'm setting the meet-up time at 10am b\/c there will be a crowd, you want time to park, find good spots to shoot, and also shoot contraptions and devices before they actually hit the water\/road.<\/p> <p>This promises to be a wild, wacky, and color photo opportunity. Plus, it's Baltimore...charm city...location of a thousand great places to eat, on the water, funky neighborhoods with ethnic charm, the Under Armour headquarters, Ft. McHenry and there's even an Orioles game that night at Camden Yards (7pm) so stick around and make a day of it. Or don't. But in any case, this event will be a cool one to shoot. More details to follow from Matt and\/or Melanie.<\/p>",

Or $75 seasonal per car, good for all state parks. 5120 South Street, Baltimore, MD 21227 GPS gets you to the park entrance. After turning in the park entrance, please pay the entrance fee at the booth.

        "description": "<p>The Gampopa Center will host a twelve-week introduction to Buddhism class from 10:30 a.m. to noon on Sundays beginning June 7. The center is located at 424 Fourth Street in Annapolis.<\/p> <p><br\/>The class will be led by Tree Marr and will center on the book \u201cThe Essence of Buddhism: An Introduction to Its Philosophy and Practice\u201d by Traleg Kyabgon. Tree Marr is a student of His Holiness the Gwalwang Drukpa and Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche.\u00a0 If you ask her about her practice she will tell you she\u2019s been learning to meditate for 40 years.<\/p> <p>The \u201cThe Essence of Buddhism\u201d is a very clear and comprehensive explanation and overview of Buddhism. One reviewer notes, \u201cAlthough this book is immense in its scope, Traleg Kyabgon never allows us to lose sight of the key point and ultimate meaning of all the Buddha\u2019s teachings: that it is possible to get to the root of suffering and to bring about lasting happiness for ourselves and others; and that the only way to do this is to work with, understand, tame, and transform our mind.\u201d<\/p> <p>The group will read the text aloud and then discuss it. It is not necessary to own or read the book in advance to attend a meeting. But people who plan to attend regularly are encouraged to own a copy of the book. People of all belief systems and current practitioners of all levels are welcome to join in and share in the conversation. Visitors and members have access to all sessions on a drop-in basis; no advance registration is required. People can attend on an \u201cas can\u201d basis, attending as much or as little as they are able.<\/p> <p>Attendees sit on floor cushions or chairs provided at the center, and each meeting will open and close with the recitation of short prayers and mantras from a prayer book. There is no need to own a copy of the prayer book for these Sunday sessions because copies will be available.<\/p> <p>The Gampopa Center was founded in 2009 by Tibetan born Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche based on the Buddhist understanding that the teachings of Buddha can bring people peace, happiness, and freedom. The center holds weekly study sessions, short courses, and special events at its Annapolis location.<\/p> <p>It is the Gampopa Center\u2019s wish to provide teachings and on a no-charge basis for those wish to explore Buddhism. While there is no fee for weekly sessions, attendees are encouraged to make a small donation if they are so moved.<\/p> <p>Visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gampopacenter.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gampopacenter.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.gampopacenter.com\/<\/a><\/a> for more information.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/3\/9\/4\/600_438114164.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

This year's race will be sporting an \"Out of This World\" theme in tribute to The Hubble Space Telescope, which recently celebrated its 25th anniversary at AVAM among many other locations.<\/p> <p>The race features human-powered works of art, designed to travel on land, through mud, and over deep harbor waters, constructed out of used bicycles, gears, and parts. The machines can be simple, small crafts, piloted by only one brave soul, or they can be over 50 feet long, extremely well-engineered, sophisticated vehicles powered by a team of pilots. Pilots (\"Kinetinauts\") compete for the most coveted GRAND MEDIOCRE EAST COAST CHAMPION AWARD (finishes right in the middle), and the highly prized NEXT TO THE LAST AWARD (finishes, well, next-to-last), and other serious trophies including ART, ENGINEERING, BEST BRIBES and more. The all-day race kicks off at 11am at American Visionary Art Museum.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nMore information about the race is available on the website:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/kineticbaltimore.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/kineticbaltimore.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/kineticbaltimore.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>",

Instead of being stuck watching the race from one spot, our group will move along with the racing teams on our bikes to see them in action the whole way. We've had a blast doing this event for the past three years!<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll be riding the same route used by the racing teams on road lanes separated from car traffic, so this is a rare chance to see Baltimore's best sights without getting run over.\u00a0Our route takes us through Federal Hill, Inner Harbor, Little Italy, Fells Point, Canton, and Patterson Park, as well as many famous streets along the way. You can view all the details, photos, and the entire race route below:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kineticbaltimore.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.kineticbaltimore.com<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/c\/f\/600_436637359.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Following our ride, we'll head to Barfly's on Federal Hill to enjoy their excellent pizza and beer. Barfly's is located just two blocks from where we park our cars at the beginning, so it's a convenient place to end up and socialize. Scroll down to check out the details for Barfly's.<\/p> <p><b>Baltimore's Kinetic Sculpture Race<\/b><\/p> <p>Each May, the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.avam.org\/\">American Visionary Art Museum<\/a> (AVAM) hosts the East Coast Kinetic Sculpture Race Championship around Baltimore\u2019s Inner Harbor. Kinetic Sculptures are creative human-powered works of art custom-built for the race.<\/p> <p><br\/>Although they're lots of fun to watch, the Kinetic Sculptures must be able to traverse 14 miles of city roads and be amphibious. The eight-hour race includes a dip into Baltimore harbor and a trip through mud and sand pits at Patterson Park. The organizers expect about 40 entries from teams that have invested a lot of imagination, time, and money building these inventive contraptions that must bear the brunt of the race all afternoon.<\/p> <p>It's all in fun to create a colorful spectacle of artistic design, clever engineering, and human bravado by the many contestants who eagerly propel their machines along Baltimore's streets and waters. The crowd becomes part of the event with their own outrageous costumes and cheering. There are awards presented at the end for everything from best artistic design to worst entry into the water at the Canton ramp.<\/p> <p>Here are some of the entries from previous races:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/c\/0\/600_434247840.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/f\/c\/600_436637404.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/4\/1\/b\/600_436637435.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Meetup and Biking Plan<\/b><\/p> <p>Our group will meet at the parking lot by McDonald's\u00a0in the Southside Market shopping plaza on E. Fort Avenue. You can get there directly from I-95 by taking Exit 55 to Key Highway or by driving through Federal Hill from Inner Harbor.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The shopping plaza has ample free parking for its many stores and is located right on the route of the Kinetic Sculpture Race. We'll get a great view of the racing entries from there without encountering any big crowds. DO NOT PARK IN THE MARKED McDONALDS CUSTOMER AREA. McDonalds tows violators, and it happened to one of our members.<\/p> <p>After watching the Kinetic Sculptures pass by while the racers are still fresh and vigorous, we'll ride our bikes over to the Cross Street Market to enjoy some tasty food and refreshments. Bruce Lee's wings and burgers and Nick's sushi bar and beer are favorites. It's fun to stand in the market aisles while eating and drinking on the barrel tables. There are also several other eating options available in the Cross Street Market.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/4\/3\/7\/600_436637463.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/5\/8\/600_436637240.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Following lunch and refreshments, we'll bike along the race route through Inner Harbor and Fells Point to catch up with the racing teams where they launch into the harbor at Canton Waterfront Park. Then our group will follow them up to Patterson Park for the mud pit and sand trap part of the race.\u00a0<\/p> <p>There's plenty of time to watch everything, relax, and enjoy the historic Canton area. After Patterson Park, we'll follow the racers back through Inner Harbor and along Key Highway up to Federal Hill where the the race ends.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Helmets Are Required For All Riders<\/b><\/p> <p>This is an easy bike ride that's suitable for anyone who can breathe and pedal at the same time. But you must be able to keep up with our group during the afternoon if you want to stay with us. Otherwise, you're on your own which is also fine since Baltimore is a fun place to explore.<\/p> <p><b>Post-Ride Pizza at Barfly's<\/b><\/p> <p>After completing the ride and loading bikes on our cars, we'll walk two blocks to Barfly's for refreshments and excellent pizza. We always have a great time there. Barfly's is located at 620 E. Fort Avenue.<\/p> <p>Details, directions, and reviews for Barfly's are here:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/barflys-baltimore\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/barflys-baltimore\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/barflys-baltimore<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>As a general rule, our SHR group prefers gathering in the bar area where we can freely mingle and get separate checks with no hassles about group ordering. We also receive much better service by ordering and paying directly at the bar.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/8\/4\/600_436637284.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Final Details<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll need good biking weather for this event. A little rain won't stop us, but we won't ride in miserable conditions. Check here on Saturday morning before 8:00 am if the weather looks doubtful. I'll post an update and send out an email if we need to change plans or cancel.<\/p> <p>Call Jake at[masked] if you need to find us. I can't always answer my phone at events, but you can try.<\/p> <p>I hope to see you there!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/a\/5\/600_434247813.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

(Race kicks off at 11am)<\/p> <p>Cost: FREE for Spectators!<\/p> <p>From the American Visionary Art Museum\u2014a race of wacky, imaginative, TOTALLY HUMAN-POWERED WORKS OF ART, DESIGNED TO TRAVEL ON LAND, THROUGH MUD, AND OVER DEEP HARBOR WATERS, constructed out of used bicycles, gears, and parts, created by a lunatic genius who tinkers around in the garage or backyard (do you know this person?)!<\/p> <p><br\/>The machines can be simple, small crafts, piloted by only one brave soul, or they can be over 50 feet long, extremely well-engineered, sophisticated vehicles powered by a team of pilots. Pilots (\"Kinetinauts\") compete for the most coveted GRAND MEDIOCRE EAST COAST CHAMPION AWARD (finishes right in the middle), and the highly prized NEXT TO THE LAST AWARD (finishes, well, next-to-last), and other serious trophies including ART, ENGINEERING, BEST BRIBES and more.<\/p> <p><br\/>Race starts at 10am at the American Visionary Art Museum (arrive early to take part in the Opening Ceremony and Blessing of De Feet). Other great spots to see the vehicles are the 1st Checkpoint atop Federal Hill; The Water Entry at the Korean War Memorial Park in Canton; the uphill Mud-Pit in Patterson Park; the not-so-quick-Sand Pit in Patterson Park; and, of course, anywhere along the 15-mile route throughout Baltimore City.

Our SHR group has attended Hamdenfest (featuring the Toilet Bowl Race), the Annual Mayor's Christmas Parade, the Night of 100 Elvis's, and the Miracle on 34th Street Christmas Lights display. Last year, we finally made it to Honfest that's probably the most popular of them all.<\/p> <p>Honfest is the world famous annual celebration of everything \"Hon\" that originated in Hampden and was popularized by John Waters in movies like Hairspray, Pink Flamingos, and Polyester. Everything tacky about the image of Bawlmer working women is exaggerated and celebrated to create an exuberant weekend of fun along four blocks of 36th Street, the main drag of Hampden. You can expect lots of creative vendors, tasty street food, truly unique shops, and a crowd you won't soon forget!\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/f\/7\/1\/600_435113105.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>With its cool urban vibe and many shops and restaurants, Hampden is always a colorful and fun place to visit. And it's even better at Honfest where people dress up in elaborate costumes to look outrageous and party. Great people watching and lots of things to keep your attention while you eat, drink, and enjoy what's happening.<\/p> <p>Our SHR group will gather at Holy Frijoles restaurant on 36th Street which is right in the middle of the festival. The food and drinks are good, and the ambience is relaxed and enjoyable.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/f\/e\/6\/600_435113222.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/0\/1\/0\/600_435113264.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/0\/2\/7\/600_435113287.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Full details about Honfest, what it's about, the event schedule, and parking are available here:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.honfest.net\/index.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.honfest.net\/index.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.honfest.net\/index.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>There are three separate performance stages at Honfest. On our Sunday visit last year, we saw the Singing Lucies, the local Elvis impersonator, a mashed potato dance contest, the best mustache contest, live music by the Hypnotic Panties, and recited the Pledge of Allegiance. There's even a sidewalk tent where people can get an instant \"Hon\" makeover. Of course, the festival's highlight is judging of the Hon Top Ten Finalists to pick a winner.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/0\/8\/a\/600_435113386.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/f\/9\/0\/600_435113136.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Get your authentic Hon thing going and show up to join the party!

        "description": "<p>When:<br\/>Sun, 06\/14\/2015 - 1:00pm - 4:15pm<br\/>Where: Park Heights Road and Clarks Lane, Baltimore This month I -- Hally -- will facilitate the use of the Intensity Practice, a favorite tool from the Mediate Your Life program. My aim is for each person to connect deeply with what is going on inside of her\/himself in moments of intensity and to honor and savor the needs that s\/he finds. In the second part of the afternoon we will look at choices we have for action in that moment. This Baltimore Sunday event is a monthly occurrence, a workshop offered by Barbra Esher or Hally Childs to support NVC understanding and practice. It\u2019s a practice group, because in our three hours together we consciously try to look at our everyday passions and pains through the lens of Nonviolent Communication. It\u2019s become a community, because that\u2019s what happens when people keep bringing their issues, their care, and their support. We welcome new participants at any level \u2013 it\u2019s fun when a \u2018newbie\u2019 comes and we, \u2018newbies\u2019 not so long ago, suddenly see that we\u2019ve learned something important we can pass on, at the same time deepening our understanding of new contexts. If you're already skilled in NVC, we would enjoy sharing support and companionship. When are you available? - We use a doodle calendar each month to pick the Sunday that the most people can attend. Write to barbraesher [at] gmail [dot] com for the link to the currently active doodle calendar.<\/p> <p>Requested fee: $15 \u2013 So far my NVC dance has yielded these as the needs behind the request: \u2018appreciation\u2019 (my efforts have value to others), \u2018support\u2019 (my costs are covered), 'ease\/fun' ($ can support rest and play, balancing the intensity of the work). I can imagine times when your needs - for choice, integrity, self-care, or you-don\u2019t-quite-know-what, are not met by contributing the requested amount. You are welcome to come in any case.<\/p> <p>For more information: Please contact Barbra at barbraesher [at] gmail [dot] com or Hope at lifeworks [at] earthlink [dot] net.

And that's all before Christmas! In the New Year, we will experience a little S&amp;M, 1960's stewardesses, secret gardens and the good people of South Boston.<\/p> <p>The[masked] Colonial Players season will consist of seven plays for less than $20 each! All shows will be Sunday matinees. Ordering before June 15th will ensure we get our excellent front row seats again.<\/p> <p><b><i>September 2015 - Sherlock's Last Case<\/i><\/b><br\/>Ruefully comic sendup of the classic sleuth's usual pursuits with tables turned in a most startling way and the perpetrator so unexpected that the audience will be asked to keep the details secret!<\/p> <p><b><i>October 2015 - Side Man<\/i><\/b><br\/>Pulitzer prize finalist and Tony Award winner is an elegy to a lost love and a lost world, beautifully told in a memory play.<\/p> <p><b><i>November 2015 - Mornings at Seven<\/i><\/b><br\/>Time spent with four charming sisters reveals devoted relationships complicated by unspoken longings, fears, suspicions or outright antipathies buried under often thin veneers of proper behavior in the early 20th century.

Nominated for 2010 Tony Award.<\/p> <p><b><i>February 2016 - Boeing Boeing<\/i><\/b><br\/>An American in Paris in 1960 juggles three fiancees - all beautiful stewardesses - one French, one German and one American, all with frequent layovers. All goes well until unexpected schedule changes brings them all to his apartment at the same time. Winner of 2008 Tony for Best Revival.<\/p> <p><b><i>April 2016 - The Secret Garden<\/i><\/b><br\/>An enchanting and haunting musical about Mary Lennox, an orphan sent to live in her uncle's sad house of mourning, but who discovers the warmth of loving and caring through the estranged, desperate occupants of the house and a beautiful secret garden. Received three Tony Awards, including for the gorgeous music and the lovely story.<\/p> <p><b><i>June 2016 - Good People<\/i><\/b><br\/>Witty and poignant portrayal of what it really means to be down on your luck in South Boston, told through the experiences of characters who resonate with integrity, tenderness and humor.

What are your current financial goals?<\/p> <p>2. Your current savings plan?<\/p> <p>3. Retirement fund, do you have one?\u00a0<\/p> <p>4. Debt: credit card, student loans<\/p> <p>5. What do you know about 'finance'?<\/p> <p>This is Finance 101, so we will also break down a few jargons and give a basic overview of popular finance terms. Ex: stocks, revolving debt vs. installment debt, compounding, and assets*. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Again this will be a basic introduction, all levels are welcome.\u00a0Only question left to ask is\u2026. are you in?? Or are you in?\u00a0<\/p>",

But you can count on this: the play is funny, whether dealing with a passionate butterfly collector who cherishes lots and lots of powerful specimens, an inept secret agent who can't stop making noises like cartoon characters, or a woman who marries, under the influence, an Irish terrorist named Zamir.<\/p> <p><i>Content Warning:<\/i> This play contains violence, mature themes, and language.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/a\/2\/7\/600_436934887.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

Yet\u00a0 the very technology designed for our well-being often serves only to isolate us from one another and distance us from the experience of all that is truly divine.<\/p> <p><br\/>The Bhakti Lounge is a place where incredible transformation and healing takes place all through the culture of bhakti. Meditation, Kirtan, Discussions on the Bhagavad Gita and other ancient texts from the Vedic tradition , Vegetarian food prepared using Bhakti &amp; Ayurvedic principles create an environment where lifelong friendships are made. As one yogi remarked\" I finally found a\u00a0 community of kindred spirits\"<\/p> <p><br\/>We meet every Sunday on 200 Bloomsbury Avenue Catonsville, MD from 6 pm to 8 pm. Please join us to create a sacred circle of love and devotion and bring bliss\/ananda in the Baltimore region and beyond.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nHope to see you soon!<\/p>",

This 2013 documentary was produced and narrated by Alice Rothchild, an American Jew who relates her personal change of mind and heart as she explores Palestinians' experiences of losses and injustices. In telling these stories, her aim is to help build a just peace for all the people of Israel and Palestine.\u00a0 As the June \"Reel &amp; Meal\" film, this event observes the City of Greenbelt's Peace Month.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>The free screening starts at\u00a07 pm.\u00a0 An optional vegan buffet at $14 will be served at\u00a06:30 pm. The New Deal Cafe is at 113 Centerway<\/p> <p>, Roosevelt Center, in historic Greenbelt.\u00a0 It is accessible by several buses from the nearby Greenbelt Metro station.<\/p> <p><br\/><i>Voices Across the Divide<\/i><\/p> <p>\u00a0was a co-winner of the 2013 Audience Award at the Boston Palestine Film Festival. From its website\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/voicesacrossthedivide.com\/documentary\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/voicesacrossthedivide.com\/documentary\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/voicesacrossthedivide.com\/documentary\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\u00a0--\u00a0 \"The idea for the film was born after Alice traveled to Israel, the West Bank and Gaza to work with and interview Israelis and Palestinians starting in 2003 and wrote a book about these experiences,<\/p> <p><i>\u00a0Broken Promises, Broken Dreams: Stories of Jewish and Palestinian Trauma and Resilience<\/i><\/p> <p>. This led to an event organized by Jewish Voice for Peace in Detroit, where Palestinians shared their stories at a public event. As she actively searched for the mostly invisible stories of Palestinians she felt the enormous human commonalities that connect Arabs and Jews. Compelled to speak out and to organize for a positive future for all of us, she started working on\u00a0Voices Across the Divide.\"\u00a0 Why released now, why to her fellow Americans?\u00a0 Alice felt compelled to get this film out, after more than sixty-five years of the Middle East conflict and debate on U.S. policy toward it, because the \"muzzling of the dialogue is a major threat to our fundamental principles of free speech and tolerance and thus to our basic democratic values. It is also deeply corruptive to our foreign policy and our ability to understand how others see us.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>Presenters and discussion leaders will be:<\/p> <p><br\/>Shelley Fudge and Jamal Najjab from Jewish Voice for Peace of DC Metro area. Shelley knows Alice Rothchild as a fellow JVP activist, and Jamal's family comes from a West Bank village.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Wardah Khalid from advocacy group Friends Committee on National Legislation. He is their Peace Fellow for Middle East Policy.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>The \"Reel &amp; Meal at the New Deal\" is a monthly series sponsored by three groups to promote knowledge and action on common social and environmental concerns- Beaverdam Creek Watershed Watch Group; Green Vegan Networking; and Prince George's County Peace and Justice Coalition.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Disclamer:<\/p> <p>This event might not necessarily reflect the views of WASH.<\/p> <p>.\u00a0<\/p>",

The Scenarios for Adventure 1 and Adventure 3 are also available at the store and can be run by anyone with a copy of the core card game and the relevant Adventure Deck numbers. If you can bring a core game please list that with your RSVP so we can expand the number of player seats.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Adventure 0-2 - A Pirate's Life<\/b><\/p> <p>Yo ho! A pirate\u2019s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\u2019s more to a pirate\u2019s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\u2019s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate\u2019s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\u2019s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.<\/p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that\u2019s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there\u2019s power, there\u2019s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play, as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we are sure we have space for, but if there is more interest, we can almost certainly make more room. So please sign up for the wait list if you want to play.<\/p> <p>3.

The evening will consist of being guided into a meditative state, where you will then be \"turned loose\" to gain insight, reflect, realign your spirit, receive guidance or simply be in the moment. This meditation time will last approximately 30 minutes, after which you will be gently brought back to the here and now. Following meditation there will be social time to share your experience (if you wish), visit with others and partake of light refreshments. There is no charge for this gathering but donations are greatly appreciated to offset refreshment costs.<\/p>",

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>",

Hope you can join us!<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------<\/p> <p>UPDATES:<\/p> <p>Here's some logistical info:<\/p> <p>1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Bring $10 cash, meet at 6:20 pm.<\/p> <p>2. I'll email my cell phone number to everyone Tuesday morning.\u00a0 Check your email, and if you don't have it by noon on Tuesday, please contact before 2 pm at<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Md\/message\/?recipientId=5312826\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Md\/message\/?recipientId=5312826\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Md\/message\/?recipientId=5312826<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>3. We'll meet at 6:20 pm at the memorial at the corner of W. Lee Street and Ravens' Walk (the pedestrian walkway between the Ravens' and Orioles' stadiums). The memorial is inscribed \"Time Will Not Dim the Glory of Their Deeds\". The exact location is marked by the red (or green) thingy on this map:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?daddr=39.28206,-76.6207&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=17&amp;t=h\"><a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?daddr=39.28206,-76.6207&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=17&amp;t=h\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?daddr=39.28206,-76.6207&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=17&amp;t=h<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>4. At 6:30 pm sharp, we'll walk up to the ticket window together and buy tickets.\u00a0 Please bring $10 in CASH to pay for your ticket.<\/p> <p>5. If you're running late, call me on my cell and we'll either wait a few minutes for you, or we'll head in and let you know where we're sitting.<\/p> <p>6. You can park at the stadium for $8.\u00a0 Again, bring cash.<\/p> <p>7. If anyone would like to ride up with me from the Laurel\/Columbia area, please let me know.\u00a0 I'm going to be leaving as soon after 5 pm as possible--definitely no later than 5:15.<\/p> <p>8. You're allowed to bring your own water, soda and snacks into the stadium. Those are often nice to have.<\/p> <p>9. A baseball cap is a good idea. It shields your eyes from the overhead field lights and makes it easier to see.<\/p> <p>10. It will be in the 80's \/ lower 90's Tuesday night, with some chance of a thundershower.\u00a0 We'll get tix under the roof, in the shade, so neither sun nor a little passing rain will mar our enjoyment of the game :-)<\/p> <p>See everyone Tuesday nite!<\/p>",

Late arrive-rs will be on their own.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>I know this seems like a strange place for a dog meet up but it's peaceful with wide paved roads that have little to no incline or distractions. Perfect for beginner walkers\/joggers\/runners. We would do this at one of the tracks around but all the various sports played on or near them could be distracting to the dogs as they learn the skill of walking\/jogging\/running on leash.<\/p> <p><b>we don't like running in the rain so if it is raining we will change our rsvp to a no. A lot of folks that run daily go n matter what the weather so we won't cancel outright. this gives those attending the chance to decide on their own if they want to run in whatever weather or not. Please be sure to change your rsvp to a no if you decide not to attend.<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>For those only wanting to walk you are welcome to join us and walk at your own pace in the opposite directions of those jogging\/running. Our goal is to get running with the dogs down. We will be increasing our pace and endurance with each practice session.\u00a0 Everyone will go at their own pace and follow the same outer path. it's all paved roads and very simple to follow the outer roads around the cemetery.<\/p> <p><i>As always count the number of dogs you are bringing and rsvp with that number not the number of people.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>We would like to ask everyone to be especially respectful of where we are. Avoid having your dog bark at or go up to those there visiting their loved ones. Do not let them walk on graves and be sure to pick up after them. There are plenty of trash bins throughout the park to dispose of bags.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>There is no water here so be sure to bring water for you and your pup especially since we will be jogging\/running. Both of you will get hot.<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>&lt;a&gt;Call&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>&lt;a&gt;Send SMS&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>&lt;a&gt;Add to Skype&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>You'll need Skype Credit<\/p> <p>Free via Skype<\/p>",

Although a $5-$10 donation is suggested, donations are not required for attendance.<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Each class will include:<\/b> guided meditation, instruction, opportunities to practice, and time for discussion, questions and answers.<\/p> <p><b>When and where:<\/b> We meet every Tuesday from 7:30-9:00 p.m. at Centennial High School, 4300 Centennial Lane, Ellicott City, MD, 21042, room 406. Please arrive early to settle into your seats - we start right at 7:30 p.m.<\/p> <p><b>We practice Insight Meditation<\/b>, a style of meditation that helps the mind attain deeper levels of calm concentration through sustained attention on the breath, then combines this with the crucial aspect of insight through contemplation of the mind and body and all of their changing and impermanent senses, emotions and thoughts. Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teacher:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a high school physics teacher who has been meditating for 25 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004. Stan is a mentor with the Insight Meditation Community of Washington (IMCW) and is a graduate of the Meditation Teacher Training Institute, a two-year certification program with senior Insight teachers Tara Brach, Jonathan Foust, Hugh Byrne, and Pat Coffey. He also teaches Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Stan also earned a Masters of Social Work in 1998.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Parking (see map below):<\/b><\/p> <p>If coming to the school from the South (Route 108) side of Centennial Lane, make a left into the bus loop just as you reach the school.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p><br\/>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>6. The group is not recommended for those under age 13.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please feel free to contact Stan Eisenstein at [masked] if you have any questions.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>",

Bring plenty of business cards and your appetite for a hot breakfast and structured networking.<\/p> <p>SPEED NETWORKING! We had over 130 entrepreneurs at the last event! Get the chance to give your elevator pitch to 40-50 of them! Here's how it works: When you arrive, check in, grab your name badge, and take a seat. Breakfast will be announced shortly after you get settled (you may be able to grab a coffee before the food comes out). Make sure you are sitting with people that are new to you! Your first \"rotation\" will be with the initial people at your table, so introduce yourself, share information, and collect\/distribute business cards. Welcome announcements and acknowledgements will take place, followed by two or three more rounds of networking. Each round will require you to get up from your chair and relocate yourself to another table where you will start the process all over again! Depending on the number at your table, you will have between 60 and 90 seconds to introduce yourself and tell your tablemates about your business, so prepare and practice your \"elevator speech\" early! This breakfast is co-hosted by Entrepreneur's Exchange and the Annapolis and Anne Arundel County Chamber of Commerce and includes members from several area chambers and business groups.<\/p> <p><b>The Entrepreneur's Exchange<\/b> is a non-profit organization located in Annapolis, Maryland. Its mission is to provide encouragement, support, education, information exchange and marketing exposure to business owners or individuals with the entrepreneurial spirit.<\/p> <p>Entrepreneur's Exchange is more than a networking or leads group.\u00a0 EE members form and cultivate solid relationships that lead to endless business opportunities.\u00a0 It's the \"sweet success\" factor that we celebrate at every meeting!<\/p> <p>Did you know that Entrepreneur's Exchange introduced the concept of the \"joint breakfast\" years ago? It's like speed dating but you meet 8 to 10 new people in each round. EE participates in six or more joint networking breakfasts each year at different locations throughout the Baltimore\/Washington area, traditionally hosting the summer breakfast in Annapolis in June. Other participating organizations include local chambers of commerce, business networking groups, technology groups, and more. Don't miss the opportunity to meet business owners and entrepreneurs from around the area and make a lot of connections - sign up for the next joint breakfast and see what all the buzz is about!<\/p>",

Songs are mostly taught in the oral tradition, sometimes with lyrics or sheet music provided. You'll find out where your voice fits in the vocal range and learn music from all over the world. If you are an experienced singer you'll love the opportunity to sing 4-part harmonies. You are guaranteed to leave with a\u00a0smile on your face and a song in your heart! We ask for a donation of $10 per week to cover the director's costs.<\/p>",

Here's the movie info from Rotten Tomatoes: WOMAN IN GOLD is the remarkable true story of one woman's journey to reclaim her heritage and seek justice for what happened to her family. Sixty years after she fled Vienna during World War II, an elderly Jewish woman, Maria Altmann (Mirren), starts her journey to retrieve family possessions seized by the Nazis, among them Klimt's famous painting 'Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I'. Together with her inexperienced but plucky young lawyer Randy Schoenberg (Reynolds), she embarks upon a major battle which takes them all the way to the heart of the Austrian establishment and the U.S. Supreme Court, and forces her to confront difficult truths about the past along the way. While the critics didn't rave about the movie, audiences gave it a resounding \"thumbs up.\"<\/p>",

Get there early.\u00a0 I plan to get there just after 5.\u00a0 If you want to be sure you can sit with the group, I suggest getting there before 5:30.\u00a0 If you arrive and there's no space to sit with us, there's nothing I can do about that.<\/p> <p>2. Use the restroom before you arrive.<\/p> <p><br\/>3. Bring a camp chair and picnic supplies including food and drink.\u00a0 Sharing is optional.\u00a0 I would guess alcohol is technically not allowed on the public pier, but you will see plenty of it and no one seems to care.\u00a0 I suggest being as discrete as possible though, for example, if you bring wine, keep the bottle in a paper bag, pour it into plastic cups, and keep it down low when pouring.<\/p> <p>4. Be prepared to enjoy the evening.\u00a0 The show doesn't start until 7 pm, so we'll have a lot of time to sit and picnic.<\/p> <p>5. The weather forecast is upper 80's with a chance of a passing thunderstorm.\u00a0 I plan to bring an umbrella just in case, although I probably won't use it.<\/p> <p>6. You can park in the Little Italy parking garage on the corner of S Central Ave and Bank St for $4 after 5 pm.\u00a0 It's about a 7 block walk to the Marriott Pier.<\/p> <p>7. I'll email my cell # to everyone Wednesday morning.\u00a0 Call if you have trouble finding us.\u00a0 Note however I'll only be taking calls until about 6:15 pm--after that, I plan to turn my phone off so I can enjoy the picnic and concert, so again, please plan to arrive early.<\/p> <p><br\/>8. If you have any questions, please post them below in the comments.<\/p> <p>See everyone on Wednesday!<\/p>",

Wheels rolling by 6:00. We will not wait past 6:00. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Pace:<\/b> Pace will be Intermediate, approx. 6.5 to 7 mph. Appropriate for average to riders, but not for beginners, or people who are not riding at least once a week. \u00a0Attitude is laid-back and friendly, but please ensure you can handle the pace and length of this ride before committing. This is a no-drop ride, i.e., we wait up for everyone at intersections. (Note: if you don\u2019t want to wait up for slower riders, this is NOT the ride for you, but please also survey your current fitness, as no one likes to be the one person holding up a larger group). \u00a0Please also note Ptap rides tend to be about 1 mph slower than Rosy, or Fairland, due terrain. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Terrain:<\/b> Ranges from Easy to Difficult. Most trails are in great shape, but plan on some mud spots. There are a few very steep climbs, rocks and technical sections, log overs (up to 10\" logs, and 3' stacks), tight single track (12\" wide in spots), and a stream crossing or two. \u00a0A strong\/advanced rider will be able to clean most sections, others will need to get off of their bikes in spots. \u00a0This is a friendly ride, so we will wait up for everyone, just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places. \u00a0This is a video edit I made from last fall through winter. \u00a0We won't hit all of this terrain, but gives you a feel for Patapsco:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Distance:<\/b>\u00a0With days getting longer we will be minimally getting 10 miles, and if conditions and light allow, we will push towards 20. \u00a0Exact route will change depending on group dynamics, trail conditions, daylight, etc. \u00a0I will typically have route planned in my head at the beginning of the ride, but will modify as needed to get us back at a reasonable time. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Duration:<\/b> I shoot to have us back before it gets dark (so 2 to 3 hours as the days get longer). \u00a0This can change with mechanical issues, and group dynamics though. \u00a0As this is a weekday ride, the stops will be just long enough for the last rider to catch their breath. \u00a0Note: wheels roll at stated time, so please don\u2019t be late.<\/p> <p><b>Bring:<\/b> Helmet (required), water (as much as you can carry), spare tube\/patch kit, pump\/CO2, multi-tool, I.D., emergency contact info where it can be easily located on your person, and a good attitude, as this ride is as much about camaraderie as it is about riding. Take a look at your bike and make sure it is in good working condition (Ptap will take its toll on the bike). \u00a0Bring a light, as you might need it. \u00a0There are ton of acceptable lights under $20 on Amazon right now. \u00a0Just look for a T6 Cree LED Bike light, with minimially 1000 lumens. \u00a0Here is a link to one: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006Y1FK18\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">Cheap 1000 lumen bike light<\/a>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B006QQX3C4\/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=3FJIG6WZ09712&amp;coliid=I15GIMB04YOTYI\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><b>Weather:<\/b> Shine Only (there will undoubtedly be some mud, but no ride if it\u2019s raining or the trails are too muddy). Protect our trails and don\u2019t ride them when they\u2019re fragile.

Bring a spray skirt if you have one.<\/p> <p>We did the last one of these at Daniels Dam on the Patapsco and it actually turned out pretty well at that location so we'll be at Daniels again.\u00a0 The group is too big for much one one one instruction so we will start off with a couple demonstrations and then break off into groups of two or three to try the rescues.\u00a0\u00a0The last couple of times\u00a0everyone was too busy\u00a0practicing to bother stopping to socialize so we will suspend the social hour for this session.<\/p> <p>Rescues are something\u00a0that all kayakers need to practice a few times a season whether you've done them before or not.\u00a0 They need to be something you do instinctively without thinking. \u00a0IF YOU ARE NOT PRACTICING YOUR RESCUES A FEW TIMES A SEASON YOU REALLY SHOULD NOT BE PADDLING A KAYAK.<\/p> <p>There are rental boats available for this paddle at a price of $25.00 for the evening delivered to the put in with paddle and PFD.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:<\/p> <p><br\/>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun! More information can be found at &lt;a&gt;www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com.&lt;\/a&gt; Hope to see you there!<\/p>",

The Abbey also features a wide selection of local, domestic, and imported beers and micro-brews, as well as an expansive bar.<\/i> <i>The Abbey is also a destination for sports fans.

Also, the organizers put a significant amount of time into setting up events. \u00a0In order for us to continue having a great time organizing these, its important that our reservations at restaurants and other places hold some weight. I know things will happen from time to time, but please take the 5 seconds to update your RSVP if your plans change. Okay, all done :) \u00a0<\/p>",

There are some cool features like man-made valleys left over from train tracks. And the entire hike is along the river so there are many views of the winding Little Gunpowder River.<\/p> <p>Meet at the Guyton\/Bottom Rd Parking lot. Hike the trail north of the river to Pleasantville rd, and then back on the trail south of the river. Moderate Hike Approximately 5 miles. Please bring a head lamp. There is a good chance we won't finish before it is too dark to hike safely without light.<\/p> <p>Please bring plenty of water. 1 Liter is recommended. The trail is dirt, rocks, roots, and some mud. Plan for appropriate footwear.<\/p> <p>We will step off at 6:45PM.<\/p> <p>Dogs are welcome on this hike but they must be well behaved and on lead at all times.<\/p> <p>Long hiking pants are highly recommended!<\/p> <p>The group usually grabs a drink afterward at Gunpowder lodge or another nearby restaurant.

Our group welcomes anyone who is interested in talking about any aspect of the vegan or veg lifestyle, including health, food preparation, compassion for animals, spirituality, activism, ecology, and more.<\/p> <p>Our meetings have been fun, lively, and supportive. Mr. Chan has a wonderful selection of vegan menu options, probably the most of any Baltimore area restaurant. \u00a0Mr. Chan is located on 1000 Reisterstown Road, across the street from the Pikes Theater. There is often street parking available. And there is free parking behind the restaurant, and a public parking area adjacent to that lot.<\/p> <p>Meetup attendees get an opportunity each month to tell us a little about themselves: where they are from; what got them interested in the veg\/vegan lifestyle; their personal interests; success stories; or a chance to get some answers to questions with regard to diet and lifestyle.<\/p> <p>And please check out the monthly <b>Earthsave Veg Dinner Series<\/b> events that are normally held on the last Saturday from 6-8 pm at Towson Presbyterian Church, 400 Chesapeake Ave in Towson.

That's a fair price for having a relaxing evening of good music and a nice social vibe by the water. Beer, wine, mixed drinks, and food are available for sale. No coolers are allowed, but be sure to bring your folding chair or blanket.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/6\/2\/7\/600_436914823.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The summer concert series on Thursday evenings is an excellent reason to get out of the house and have some FUN.\u00a0We'll plan to meet around 6:00 pm to find a place to sit and mingle before the concert starts at 7:00 pm. Look for us having a good time or call Jake at[masked]-8435. I can't always answer my phone at events, but you can try.<\/p> <p>In case of inclement weather, the concerts will be canceled with a notice posted on the museum's website. For more information and directions visit\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amaritime.org\/\">www.amaritime.org<\/a>\u00a0or call the museum staff at[masked]-0104.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/5\/f\/b\/600_436914779.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/6\/3\/4\/600_436914836.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

        "description": "<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/c\/5\/e\/600_438044126.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>About the Series and Inspiration:<\/b><\/p> <p>In my 10 years of experience in spirituality, I have run the gamut. I\u2019ve gone to conventions, crystal shows, spiritual workshops, yoga retreats, angel classes, healing circles and more reiki shares than you can shake a stick at. All of it has led me to believe that 90% of healers and spiritualists of this age are lost. Not lost as in they do not know what to do, many have pretty spot-on intuition, but lost as in they do not know how healing works. They do not understand the intricate of the art. The universal language is misunderstood, is a non-thought, intention and expectation become something that must be said aloud before the healing begins and often times fail to understand the limits of their own modalities. The classes in this series are designed to fill the cracks in the foundation. We\u2019ll be dedicating classes to concepts such as nonthought, karma, the universal language, how to heal ailments hard-written into the body versus those that are not and many more.<\/p> <p><b>The Universal Language:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 As healers, I cannot stress enough how important it is to be able to understand the universe when it tries to communicate with us. However, many of us do not know how to communicate with it, or worse, we believe the universe is speaking to us when in actuality it is our biological systems.<\/p> <p>Newsflash to us! The Universe doesn\u2019t speak English. If it did, people would be traveling to America, England and Australia to find spirituality, rather than places like India, Nepal and Tibet. Then, what language does it speak? It is one that is felt, rather than spoken aloud. Our minds translate it so often that we never think to acknowledge that feeling until it has already become a word. If you have ever had a moment wherein you were completely speechless, because there was no word to describe what just happened, this is the reason. The core concept is simple: the Universal Language is limitless and man-made languages are limited. The best way to jumpstart your healing abilities is to learn to speak this language so the universe will be able to comprehend your intentions. They\u2019ll come across with less of an accent, and you\u2019ll be able to clearly comprehend the responses you receive.<\/p> <p><b>What will you be able to do after this class?<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0Translate signs of the universe, such as aura\/auric colors, visions and dreams<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Know when messages are divine messages and messages from the body or ego<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Transmit and receive basic codes, feelings and messages<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Get a truer sense in knowing what needs to be healed<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Expand your healing tool kit so that each session can have more customization<\/p> <p><b> Required Experience Healing: None!<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>These classes will be geared towards advanced healers, so at least a few years of experience with energetic healing arts, such as reiki, seichim, qigong or crystal work will provide a great foundation to understand the concepts discussed. However, the healing secrets exposed in this class series will be explained in such a way that even those with little to no basic knowledge of energy, healing or spirituality will be able to understand.<\/p> <p><b> Fee per person: $5; cash only upon arrival (no credit card or checks)<br\/>Minimum number of registrants: 5<br\/><\/b>For more info: Contact Colton Parker: <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a> or<br\/>call: &lt;a&gt;(301)[masked]&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>\n\n<b><i>***Night of this event,\u00a0receptionist not available to answer calls in the evenings and messages will be returned the next day.<\/i><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>---About Colton:\u00a0\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/knXQVhhXZPU\"><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/knXQVhhXZPU\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/knXQVhhXZPU<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Colton is a spiritual-realist. He ascribes to no one modality of spirituality, rather allows as many as possible shape and shift his own consciousness, guiding him to his own inner truth. He has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Operations Management with a minor in Japanese, which have heavily affected his spiritual path. He also has a strong background in reiki, possessing a master-teacher certification for Usui Reiki (1-4 and 5-18), Kundalini Reiki, Lighterian Reiki, Karunaki, Shamballa (multidimensional healing or MDH) and Ayurvedic Reiki. He prides himself on being a teacher not only to his formal students but also to friends and family, teaching even as they realize not how they are being taught. As a teacher, Colton\u2019s uniqueness lies in his clarity of expression, his ability to see connections overlooked by others, and the shifted state he enters when teaching a class. His spiritual growth was most affected by his 10+ years of Reiki and Crystal experiences, his current pursuit of kundalini yoga teaching certification, his study of quantum physics, the eight months he spent in Japan, as well as his own spiritual teachers.<\/p>",

This event is open to Reiki Practitioners as well as those simply curious about Reiki. Reiki practitioners of all levels of training, as well as all lineages, often enjoy the opportunity to participate in communal Reiki sessions known as Reiki Shares or Reiki Circles. The sessions give each person a chance to learn from one another as practitioners, as well as benefiting from multiple healing hands during the sessions. At this event we will take turns performing and receiving Reiki. Those that are not Reiki practitioners will be pared up with experienced Reiki practitioners. This is a fun event to be enjoyed by all. Please let me know in your response if you are new to Reiki or a practitioner of some level.

Be sure to arrive early enough to get you kayak and gear ready. The plan is to get on the water and welcome L'Hermione as she enters Baltimore Harbor between 7:30 and 8:00AM. Then escort her (if we are permitted) to the Inner Harbor where she will dock next to the USS Constellation.<\/p> <p>Pack a snack or lunch for yourself and be sure to bring plenty of water to stay hydrated. Wear non-cotton clothing, a hat, and sunscreen. We should be off the water before 11:00 AM.<\/p> <p>For more information see : <a href=\"http:\/\/hermione2015.com\/voyage2015\/baltimore\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/hermione2015.com\/voyage2015\/baltimore<\/a><\/p> <p>Kayaking involves known and unanticipated risks including physical injury and death that cannot be eliminated without jeopardizing the essential quality of the sport. Group organizers and leaders and other members cannot pay continuous attention to all participants. Participants must be responsible for their own safety. Don\u2019t overestimate your skills and abilities. Take instructional courses to learn about paddling technique, safety, self-rescue and hypothermia. Be aware of the tides, currents and weather conditions that will affect your safety on the days you paddle. Cooperate with group organizers, leaders and other members to insure your own safety as well as the safety of others and make it the fun, enjoyable day on the water it should be.<\/p>",

At Trail Days last month, the AT Through hikers told me, it was there favorite place and the rhododendron were not even blooming yet! We will start at Carver's Gap and walk 7 miles to Yellow Mountain Trail Shelter on the AT, ditch our packs and day hike on to Hump Mountain Balds, then back to the shelter, then backpack out again the next day...or if we are so overwhelmed can come back on Monday, depending on the group! Please be prepared to walk up to 21 miles total and 14 with a backpack on. You must also be prepared for rain and a great time! This is top flight summer backpacking, so saddle up, make that commitment and let's head down to Roan Mountain, on the NC\/TN border!<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>If you can only make one Happy Hour this year enjoy it, but if you can make two Happy Hours this year you don't want to miss this one! This is my 9th annual End of the Year, school year, happy hour, and last year was one of the best yet with over 150ppl joining us. This is an event shared with Charm City Social Club, and BNG meetups'. For years I did this at Bay Cafe, but last year we found out that Little Havana is just as much fun, they will again be giving us the side bar area as well as the outside area with its own seating and Corn Hole. So unlike previous years when the large group was spread out all over Bay Caf\u00e9 we will have a more central location this year, so it will be easier to figure out who is with the group. For those who are worried about parking, free parking can be found in the lot to the left of Little Havana, next to Digital Harbor High School which is right down the street, and there is a parking garage next to the Rusty Scupper. I will be there around 4:30 for those who want to sneak out of work a little early, and be staying late for those who are stuck working. It should be a fun way to kick off the summer season, so I hope to see you all there..... Doug<\/p>",

        "description": "<p><b>*** If you are attending this practice, please don't forget to sign up on\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com\/\">our website<\/a>\u00a0by clicking the \"Sign Up\" link at the top. ***<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>The BDBC open practices occur every Wednesday from 6:15 to 7:30 PM and Saturday mornings from 8:00 to 9:00. For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun! More information can be found at &lt;a&gt;www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com.&lt;\/a&gt; Hope to see you there!<\/p>",

The Rays of Hope Awards are given to outstanding African-American men who have excelled in their professions, and who serve as role models to younger Black men and boys. Awards are given in the categories of education, government, medicine, business, religion, and community and charitable services. Past winners include Congressman Elijah Cummings, Dr. Freeman Hrabowski, Ill, President of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and Tuskegee Airmen Dr. Cyril Byron.<\/p> <p>The Rays of Hope Breakfast is a time for Black Professional Men, Inc. to showcase its mentoring program, and to give scholarships to deserving Black male students from the Baltimore metropolitan area. In the past twenty years, Black Professional Men Inc. has awarded scholarships to more than 200 deserving African American male high school graduates. This year marks the 22nd anniversary of the Rays of Hope Breakfast. In honor of this momentous occasion, our goal is to award $1500 in scholarships, bringing our total scholarship giving over the past 21 years over $200,000.<\/p> <p>In order to achieve this goal, and to celebrate twenty-one years of the event, we have planned a spectacular weekend of fun, informative, and inspiring events.\u00a0 The Rays of Hope Awards and Scholarship Breakfast which will take place on Saturday, June 20, 2015 from 9:00 am to12:00 pm at Martin\u2019s Valley Mansion.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Purchase tickets, advertising or vending opportunities at:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/22nd-annual-rays-of-hope-awards-and-scholarship-breakfast-tickets-16171121259\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/22nd-annual-rays-of-hope-awards-and-scholarship-breakfast-tickets-16171121259\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/22nd-annual-rays-of-hope-awards-and-scholarship-breakfast-tickets-16171121259<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>DONT FORGET TO LIST ME AS THE MEMBER WHO REFERRED YOU!!!!<\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p>-Will Holmes<\/p>",

Beginner kayakers are provided kayaking instruction and skill building tips in a safe and controlled environment in one of our beautiful park pools. Not a beginner and just want to practice? We can go over the basics of rescue techniques and wet exits. We will be at the Cherry Hill Splash Park every Saturday from 1-3 pm there is a $2 general admission to enter the pool. Some folks just need a 15 min refresher and others want to just hang out at the pool. We recommend you bring a chair and what ever else you need to spend the afternoon at the pool. There is a 3 story spiral water slide at this pool(FYI)! Please come dressed to swim in the pool!<\/p> <p>Participants must be 50 pounds and up and children under 18 must be accompanied by a parent to kayak. RESERVATIONS ARE RECOMMENDED.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Each meeting follows the Foundation for Shamanic Studies' general approach for teaching and building Core Shamanism and teaches journey techniques for all levels. \u00a0There is a discussion and topic presented with each class, and these themes are integrated into the journey work. If you are new to journeying, or are new to these classes, please come 15 minutes early (see below).<\/p> <p>There is lore within the Eddas as well that sheds light on how the shamanic path was treated historically in Europe. While this class supports any religion and faith, and requires tolerance to the diversity of religious traditions within cultures, it does have more of a focus on classic mystery traditions.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you don't know how to journey, please contact Christian (xtian) in advance, although this step is not necessary. A brief introduction to journeying is available for beginners and experienced journeyers new to our group. \u00a0If so, please show up about 15 minutes early.<\/p> <p>This monthly journey group will help students of all levels build the divine connections to their teachers and\/or power animals. Each session will consist of two journeys, and will allow a community to share questions and have structured feedback on how to improve your skills in journeying, as well as strengthen your subtle bodies for spiritual work no matter what your personal religious calling may be.<\/p> <p>$10 donation sliding scale is appreciated. \u00a0Donations support the group meetups and our larger community events!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Notes on what you should bring, and requests:<\/b><\/p> <p>If you feel more comfortable lying down, bring a yoga mat or comfortable pad that you wish.<\/p> <p>If you have a rattle or shamanic drum that is not too loud, please do bring that.<\/p> <p>Bring a notebook and pen, or some thing to take notes on!<\/p> <p>Bring water for personal hydration. \u00a0Please try not to eat a very large meal immediately before the class. Heavy foods can interfere with this work, especially if spiritual work is new to you. \u00a0I do encourage a light snack however, as a starving student can be equally distracted.<\/p> <p>Finally, please be on time. \u00a0We will spend the first 15 minutes sharing and learning, and then begin our first journey. \u00a0If you do arrive once the journeying has begun, be quiet and respectful, and take the time to journey for yourself.<\/p> <p>Be respectful and turn off all cell phones and pagers during the event.<\/p>",

Sound tools entrain the brain to move into the deeper Alpha and Theta brain wave frequencies. These are the frequencies that induce deep meditative and peaceful states, clarity of mind and intuition. Sound frequency impacts the sympathetic nervous system as your brain waves synchronize to the sound vibrations. The harmonic vibrations engage the relaxation reflex and slow down the respiratory, brain and heart rate and disrupt the pain reflex. Modern medicine can now measure and confirm the practice of sound as a means to promote healing. Thus, sound is a type of energy medicine that creates the sacred space in which people can heal the body, mind and spirit and aid in opening to your Divine power.<\/p> <p>I will be using many types of sound healing from ancient drumming, to newer technologies of Crystal singing bowls.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\". That way, we know not to be waiting for you. Thanks.<\/b><\/p> <p>So come join us on Sunday for a brisk walk in the park. It's a great way to clean out the cobwebs and start a Sunday.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

(Happy Father's Day!) The Taphouse has a large lot out front, and there's also a large B&amp;A trail parking area on the other side of the street. We'll be visiting the Taphouse following our bike ride for food and refreshments.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/2\/1\/0\/600_436065584.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/2\/4\/3\/600_436065635.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>After unpacking our bikes, we'll gather in the lot by the ranger station where restrooms are available. Then we'll get on the B&amp;A Trail riding south about severn miles toward Annapolis. When we reach the end of the bike trail near Rt. 50, our group will turn around and come back the same way.<\/p> <p>Much of the B&amp;A trail is shaded as it passes through wooded suburban sections of Severna Park and Arnold. The scenery is interesting, and there are signs along the way describing the Baltimore and Annapolis Short Line railroad that ran this route starting in 1880. We'll\u00a0cross a few bridges during the ride, and\u00a0stop at a nice rest area with shops selling cold drinks and snacks.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As this is a recreational ride, our group will pedal at a relaxed pace taking rest stops as needed. Because the trail is built on a former railroad bed, parts of it travel a slight uphill grade, but there are no steep hills. The roundtrip distance for this ride is 15 miles on a paved trail surface. Since it's an up and back ride, any stragglers can rejoin the group on the return journey.<\/p> <p><b>ALL RIDERS MUST WEAR A HELMET!<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/1\/f\/3\/600_436065555.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/2\/9\/a\/600_436065722.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>After the ride, we can walk across the street to enjoy the Severna Park Taphouse that features a large selection of beers, good food, and an outdoor picnic area in the rear.

Yet\u00a0 the very technology designed for our well-being often serves only to isolate us from one another and distance us from the experience of all that is truly divine.<\/p> <p><br\/>The Bhakti Lounge is a place where incredible transformation and healing takes place all through the culture of bhakti. Meditation, Kirtan, Discussions on the Bhagavad Gita and other ancient texts from the Vedic tradition , Vegetarian food prepared using Bhakti &amp; Ayurvedic principles create an environment where lifelong friendships are made. As one yogi remarked\" I finally found a\u00a0 community of kindred spirits\"<\/p> <p><br\/>We meet every Sunday on 200 Bloomsbury Avenue Catonsville, MD from 6 pm to 8 pm. Please join us to create a sacred circle of love and devotion and bring bliss\/ananda in the Baltimore region and beyond.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nHope to see you soon!<\/p>",

Then on the water we will continue with stretching exercises while seated in kayaks. Once we have loosened up we will paddle upriver with guided meditation for a short distance. Then kaykers will have the opportunity to concentrate on their individual paddling techniques. This would be a good time to plan ahead to practice particular strokes you would like to work on.<\/p> <p>The paddle upriver will be in silence to support the meditative process. We will paddle about two miles then stop for a ten-minute meditation session on land and have lunch.\u00a0Silence will be optional (but probably not observed) at lunch and on the downriver paddle.<\/p> <p>What is mindfulness paddling? It is paying attention to one\u2019s environment and how one\u2019s actions affect the movement of the kayak. It is an opportunity to paddle from one\u2019s hara keeping the back straight, shoulders relaxed and being aware of how one's body and mind affect our world.<\/p> <p>You are required to wear a PFD and bring a whistle.\u00a0Bring water, lunch\/snacks, a hat, and sunscreen, comfortable clothes that could get wet and sandals\/water shoes.\u00a0<\/p> <p>12:00 PM is on the water time so be sure to arrive with plenty of time to unload your kayak and get ready. There are no bathroom facilities at Daniels Dam. We should be off the water by 3:00PM.<\/p> <p>Kayaking involves known and unanticipated risks including physical injury and death that cannot be eliminated without jeopardizing the essential quality of the sport. Group organizers and leaders and other members cannot pay continuous attention to all participants. Participants must be responsible for their own safety. Don\u2019t overestimate your skills and abilities. Take instructional courses to learn about paddling technique, safety, self-rescue and hypothermia. Be aware of the tides, currents and weather conditions that will affect your safety on the days you paddle. Cooperate with group organizers, leaders and other members to insure your own safety as well as the safety of others and make it the fun, enjoyable day on the water it should be.<\/p>",

The Scenarios for Adventure 1 and Adventure 3 are also available at the store and can be run by anyone with a copy of the core card game and the relevant Adventure Deck numbers. If you can bring a core game please list that with your RSVP so we can expand the number of player seats.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Adventure 0-2 - A Pirate's Life<\/b><\/p> <p>Yo ho! A pirate\u2019s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\u2019s more to a pirate\u2019s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\u2019s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate\u2019s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\u2019s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.<\/p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that\u2019s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there\u2019s power, there\u2019s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play, as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we are sure we have space for, but if there is more interest, we can almost certainly make more room. So please sign up for the wait list if you want to play.<\/p> <p>3.

        "description": "<p>Beginning June 22, the Gampopa Center will offer a new twelve-week class on the preliminary practices of Tibetan Buddhism on Monday evenings from 7:00 pm until 8:30 pm. The class will study the book Words of My Perfect Teacher, a complete translation of a classic introduction to Tibetan Buddhism. The text is a commentary on the preliminary practices of the Longchen Nyingthig, one of the best known cycles of teachings and a spiritual treasure of all of the traditions of Tibetan Buddhism.<\/p> <p>The text is divided into two major parts. Part One covers the Ordinary or External Preliminary practices, of the tradition, and Part Two discusses the Extraordinary or Internal Preliminary practices. The External Preliminaries are divided into the Four Thoughts, including the 1) Freedoms and Advantages of a Precious Human Existence; 2) Impermanence; 3) Suffering of Samsara; and 4) Karma, the Principle of Cause and Effect. There are two additional sections on 5) the Benefits of Attaining Liberation from Samsara, and the 6) Proper Way to Follow a Spiritual Teacher.<\/p> <p>Michael Hess will lead the Monday evening class, which will also include a short meditation. Hess has been a Tibetan Buddhist for almost 20 years, and has studied and practiced the preliminary practices of the Longchen Nyingthig for more than a decade. With his generous attitude and practice-oriented, engaging teaching style, he makes Buddhist wisdom accessible and relevant to modern students.<\/p> <p>New students are welcome throughout the series. The class is suitable for students of all levels, including those new to Tibetan Buddhism or the preliminary practices. It is not necessary to own or read the book in advance to attend a meeting. Visitors and members have access to all sessions on a drop-in basis; no advance registration is required. People can attend on an \u201cas can\u201d basis, attending as much or as little as they are able. Attendees sit on floor cushions or chairs provided at the center. The Gampopa Center was founded in 2009 by its main teacher, Tibetan born Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche. The center holds weekly study sessions, short courses, and special events at its Annapolis location. It is the Gampopa Center\u2019s wish to provide teachings and on a no-charge basis for those wish to explore Buddhism. While there is no fee for weekly sessions, attendees are encouraged to make a small donation if they are so moved.<\/p> <p>For more information, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gampopacenter.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.gampopacenter.com\/<\/a> or email [masked].<\/p>",

If a game is almost over, it is OK to to finish the game, but it is NOT OK to start a new game around 11PM. Yes, for years, even though our permit was until 10:30 PM, we sometimes played until 11, 11:30 and sometimes even past midnight. Until-a new, nasty custodian turned us in to the Vice Principal, who sent an e-mail to the Rec council who forwarded it to us. We then had to be out of the gym 10:30 PM sharp, NO EXCEPTIONS. After that, when we put in for a new permit, we requested that the time be extended until 11Pm, which was approved.\u00a0<\/p> <p>WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW ANYTHING THAT COULD POSSIBLY AFFECT OUR 35+ YEARS CONTINUOUS PERMIT AT THE OM HIGH SCHOOL.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>\u2018Girl with a Pearl Earring\u2019 by Johannes Vermeer is one of the most enduring paintings in the history of art. Even today, its recent world tour garnered huge queues lining up for the briefest glimpse of its majestic beauty - In Japan 1.2 million people saw the exhibition. Yet the painting itself is shrouded in mystery. This beautifully filmed new documentary seeks to investigate the many unanswered questions associated with this extraordinary piece. Who was this girl? Why and how was it painted? Why is it so revered?<\/p> <p>Enjoying unparalleled exclusive access to this historical exhibition at the Mauritshuis in The Hague, the film takes the audience on a journey as it seeks to answer many of the questions surrounding this enigmatic painting and its mysterious creator, Vermeer. Using the recently completed and highly complex makeover of the museum as its starting point, the film goes on a behind the scenes detective journey to seek out the answers that lie within the other masterpieces housed in the collection.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/9\/4\/2\/600_436938754.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>See the preview here:<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/WnPjGxPuxeM\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/WnPjGxPuxeM<\/a><\/p>",

Washington that can handle 200 or more people, with plentiful parking, and convenient access for those that live outside the city. What more can you ask?<\/p> <p>The DLA Piper building is in the Mt. Washington Conference Center campus (up the hill), and it is a totally amazing building. Check it out:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/charlesbrickbauer.com\/images\/usfg1.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>To get to the venue, use the Smith street entrance (and not the entrance that weaves its way through the Mt. Washington Conference Center). See below map for detail.<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?hl=en&amp;georestrict=input_srcid:e01105162751571c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;view=map&amp;cid=17763643535889233356&amp;q=DLA+Piper+LLP+%28US%29&amp;ved=0CBgQpQY&amp;ei=wePyS5iQCYSKsQO8xaGyBg&amp;hq=DLA+Piper+LLP&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=39.379625,-76.654315&amp;spn=0.01161,0.018239&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A&amp;source=embed\">View Larger Map<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/i.imm.io\/r6F0.png\" \/> <b>Parking &amp; Transportation<\/b><br\/>Parking is plentiful and there's a lot right next to the building, with plenty of room for all attendees. And it's free. What can be better? One favor, tho -- leave the few visitor spots that are right in front of the building available for the use of the offices. They have some elderly clients who aren't able to walk up the walkway to the building. The lot is really big and very close so you shouldn't need those spots anyways.<\/p> <p>Public Transportation<\/p> <p>The Mt. Washington campus is located very conveniently near the Light Rail stop, which is literally just down the hill from the venue. Get off at the Mt. Washington Light Rail station, and then climb the steps to the Octagon Building at Mt. Washington and from there you can get to the DLA Piper building. It's a 15-20 minute walk at most.<\/p> <p>There are also shuttles from the JHU Homewood and JHMI campuses right to the Mt. Washington Conference center, including one that leaves at 7:40AM from Homewood getting in by 8AM, and leaving at 9:35AM to return to Homewood. Very convenient.<\/p> <p><b>Consent to Recording and Photography<\/b> By attending this event, you consent to having yourself and\/or your presentation video recorded and\/or photographed by the TechBreakfast organizers and\/or anyone else attending.
