Bring your own creativity into the group, and present your ideas. Showcase it ourselves, maybe organize a show? I don't know! Lets go crazy, because this is the city where everything is accepted. NYC!<\/p>\n<p>Collaboration of MUSIC: If you are a pianist, guitarist, composer, or singer(English\/Hindi) we can have a meet and try to make something together. Composers can create music, and musicians can try to execute it through instrument or voice. We can have karaoke sessions to showcase singing talent or practice it yourself. Try to sing your favorite songs of favorite singers. If you play an instrument then practice and perform a song that you like!<\/p>\n<p>Acting, and dancing isn't all that this page is about. If you write stories, then we can shape it into a cinematic script. If you love to capture beautiful footage of people, documenting life, actions, or reactions then you may have a really good eye for shooting a scene. If you are a DJ, or a synthesizer, then you must have a good idea of what music goes with a certain mood\/feeling and that could work great as a music director\/composer.

Certain key techniques will be demonstrated.<\/p>\n<p>In Japanese cuisine there is more emphasis on freshness and seasonality of the ingredients. The huge variety of seasonal foods results in an appreciation of when the different foods are in season and their suitability for providing satisfaction at the time of year when their quality is at its best. Care is taken to make the prepared foods very digestible. Lightness and transparency through fine simplicity is my favourite part of a Japanese meal.<\/p>\n<p>I choose a specifically practical approach for teaching technique, so you will be pleasantly surprised at how easily fine flavor and visual delight can be achieved at your own home after my cooking class.<\/p>\n<p>The most important thing in my class is that you are having fun while you learn. After cooking is done, you will enjoy the dishes you cooked. The cooking classes are held in the East Village.<\/p>\n<p>The price of each class is around 50 dollars.

What is consciousness? We all know the immediate experience of what it is to be conscious, but from a scientific perspective what on earth it is!? Is it as Francis Cricks \"Astonishing Hypothesis\" suggests - a phenomena completely explainable as the result of complex neuronal interactions, or is it a quantum mechanical phenomena ? Perhaps its a self-referential computer program running in the brain, or just an elaborate illusion - or is consciousness actually the ultimate underpinning of all reality... ? So far little consensus has been achieved on which of these wildly diverse approaches (if any) is correct. However, ongoing improvements in brain scanning technologies and developments in artificial intelligence ensure that the field continues to rapidly evolve, so the future promises some exciting developments! The group will provide a forum to review and informally discuss some of these wide ranging theories with video viewings and book reviews and also (hopefully) some in person lectures from local experts (given that NYC academic institutions are a hotbed of neuroscience and the philosophy of mind). We'll also discuss some of the potential implications of a successful scientific theory and what kind of tools it might lead to for enhancing consciousness in the future.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/7\/d\/2\/highres_148722962.jpeg","photo_id":148722962,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/7\/d\/2\/600_148722962.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/7\/d\/2\/thumb_148722962.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":9328982,"name":"Tracey Lall"},"members":124,"name":"Astonishing Hypothesis - science of consciousness meetup","id":4538322,"state":"NY","urlname":"Astonishing-Hypothesis-science-of-consciousness-meetup","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Cosmists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"White Plains","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1344889664000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"gay","name":"Gay","id":447},{"urlkey":"Lesbian","name":"Lesbian","id":742},{"urlkey":"gaypros","name":"Gay Professionals","id":4270},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"gaycouples","name":"Gay Couples","id":4605},{"urlkey":"lgbtfriends","name":"LGBT","id":10050},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"gay-singles","name":"Gay Singles","id":15196},{"urlkey":"gay-and-lesbian-friends","name":"Gay and Lesbian Friends","id":16464},{"urlkey":"lgbt-social-group","name":"LGBT Social Group","id":17665},{"urlkey":"lesbian-friends","name":"Lesbian Friends","id":21736},{"urlkey":"lesbian-couples","name":"Lesbian Couples","id":22783},{"urlkey":"lgbt-parents","name":"LGBT Parents","id":33601},{"urlkey":"lesbian-social-networking","name":"Lesbian Social Networking","id":36427},{"urlkey":"lgbtq","name":"LGBTQ","id":64804}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TheLOFTLGBTCenter\/","rating":4.55,"description":"<p>The LOFT is a meet-up location for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and allied communities.

The human mind is always changing and is always trying to add more desirable experiences. There is no end to this addition. The way to find peace and clarity is to know the real world, the True world, by subtracting the past that has been recorded and stored within the body and mind as pictures.<\/p>\n<p>There is nothing more valuable than one's mind. It shapes the entire world that one knows. Through subtracting method\u00a0 the Universe mind will remain. This mind is always at peace regardless of conditions. It is the mind where there is no more ups and downs.<\/p>\n<p>Become free of the limitations imposed by the past. These pictures dictate thoughts, emotions, desires, behaviors and health.

By subtracting the human mind with the subtraction method of meditation , people can remove the source of all disturbances. Even one's body will become healthier through practice since stress and other emotions cause so many health problems.<\/p>\n<p>People live according to what they have in their minds. Through subtraction one's mind will change to the Universe mind and always follow the flow of nature. People will come to clearly know meaning and purpose in living.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone from any background is warmly welcomed. Come to know Truth directly from within without any reference to what one has found or been told in the past. Thi meditation\u00a0does not tell people to believe or not believe something, but through subtraction, they confirm for themselves. When the human mind changes to the Universe mind it is born again and never dies.<\/p>\n<p>--- What People Say About the Meditation ---<\/p>\n<p>\"Throughout my entire life I always felt like there was something missing. So I kept adding more and became stressed, but this method of subtraction \u00a0was just the opposite. Instead of adding, the meditation provided a simple method of subtraction. After subtracting my past I began to change my mind; how I viewed the world. The method of subtraction allowed me to get rid of my 'self' and my self-centered mind which controlled my speech, thought, and action. Meditation with subtraction method allows me to live freely, without judgment and with gratitude.\" - Ben \/ Foster City, CA<\/p>\n<p>\"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meditationusa.org\/\">Meditation<\/a> of subtraction method\u00a0transcends the boundaries of all religions. It will elevate the human mind to the highest level of existence; the level of divinity. That is where peace is; the element that is meant to control the universe. Once we achieve a permanent peace, we can give it to others.\" -Dr. Charles Marcieca \/ International Association of Educators for World Peace. UN-NGO<\/p>\n<p>\"I have tried other forms of meditation in the past, but none stuck because they lacked the method of subtraction.

In addition to scientifically proven health benefits of meditation, these techniques can take you even deeper into an expanding connection with your spirit. <\/p>\n<p>If you do not know how to meditate, we can teach you simple yet profound techniques.&nbsp; If you already meditate we can help you learn how to meditate with more concentration and upliftment for those ready to take the next step on their spiritual journey.&nbsp; In addition to a meditation, each meeting is unique with a different theme and will usually include: chanting, breath work (pranayama), spiritual reading and discussion, healing prayers...&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Everyone is welcome to join us. No prior experience is required. The group meets several times per month.&nbsp; We have a fairly large distribution email list outside of MeetUp.&nbsp; So typically many other members come to the events, but may not be RSVP'd on MeetUp.&nbsp; We also host many workshops and events, check <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anandanewyork.org\">our website<\/a> for the most updated schedule.<\/p>\n<p>Our Roots:&nbsp; Based on the teachings of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.expandinglight.org\/about\/paramhansa-yogananda.php\">Paramhansa Yogananda<\/a>, and founded in 1968 by his direct disciple, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.expandinglight.org\/about\/swami-kriyananda.php\">Swami Kriyananda<\/a>, Ananda meditation groups welcome seekers from all backgrounds.&nbsp; We also offer support to those interested in the path of kriya yoga taught by Parmhansa Yogananda, author of the spiritual classic, Autobiography of a Yogi.<\/p>\n<p>\u0950 \u0950 \u0950 <\/p>\n<p>Official Website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anandanewyork.org\/\">www.anandanewyork.org<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AnandaNYC?ref=hl\">facebook.com\/AnandaNYC<\/a><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/7\/c\/6\/highres_313011142.jpeg","photo_id":313011142,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/7\/c\/6\/600_313011142.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/7\/c\/6\/thumb_313011142.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":5201056,"name":"Colleen "},"members":232,"name":"Ananda NYC Paramhansa Yogananda Meditation & Satsang","id":4627072,"state":"NY","urlname":"Ananda-NYC-Paramhansa-Yogananda-Meditation-Satsang","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Yogis"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Jersey City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1345778985000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"womens-business-networking","name":"Women's Business Networking","id":21283},{"urlkey":"women-small-business-owners","name":"Women Small Business Owners","id":23633},{"urlkey":"jersey-city","name":"Jersey City","id":57300}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/JerseyCityEntrepreneurialWomensNetwork\/","rating":4.92,"description":"<p>Are you an <span>entrepreneur or <\/span>small business owner in Jersey City or surrounding area?

This is not a superficial singles discussion; it\u2019s an exclusive social experience based on the concepts of Fromm, Maslow, Reich, Ellis, and other greats in humanistic philosophy and psychology. The philosopher Martin Buber said that life is an encounter with oneself, others and nature, but we need to have these encounters enhance warmth, mutual understanding and health. In this new series of Meet-ups, on the third Friday of each month, we will explore all the many aspects of interaction and relationships that ultimately make our lives more gratifying and effective. With guidance from an experienced group moderator, participants will create an experiential dialogue of sharing and learning, followed by relaxed socializing and light refreshments. The Humanist Inspirational Meetup is based on many years of highly successful development at the Humanist Foundation; its leader and counselor Joseph B. David has professionally conducted hundreds of humanist growth workshops and seminars. The hectic pace and complexities of today\u2019s life make this program a welcome setting for meeting like-minded people and exploring ideas together.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/7\/0\/highres_157403152.jpeg","photo_id":157403152,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/7\/0\/600_157403152.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/7\/0\/thumb_157403152.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":35230322,"name":"Alyson Ben David"},"members":305,"name":"Humanistic Interpersonal Meetup","id":4849852,"state":"NY","urlname":"Humanistic-interpersonal-Meetup","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Humanist Explorers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Montclair","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1347317408000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"zumba","name":"Zumba","id":15451},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"trying-new-things","name":"Trying New Things","id":28744}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ZUMBA-Montclair-NJ-FUZE-Fitness\/","rating":4.94,"description":"<p><span><strong>If you love music, dancing and interested in adding alittle SPicE to your workout routine ~ then this Meetup Group is just right for YOU!<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span><strong>It's a place where you can GET FiT, have a blast and meet other local FiTness Lovers in a fun-loving, health-conscious and inspiring atmosphere.

It seemed that there was a place for a group that gives programmer-level (but not too scary!) introductions to languages that members have always heard about but haven't ever delved into.

All levels are welcome, especially those who are already fluent in French ! It would be awesome to meet a few times a month, locations to be determined (there is an amazingly delicious French restaurant in town ...hint hint:). I started this group because I traveled to Paris a few months ago with my husband and absolutely fell in love with this amazing city. Since our trip, I've been learning French, eating lots of French food, listening to Gypsy Jazz and watching every possible French movie I can get my hands on! So who's with me???? Come -- speak French, meet new friends, mange, drink a lot of wine and have un tres bon moment!

Events include but are not limited to: dining out, pot-luck dinners, meeting for a movie, attending musical performances and other cultural events, or anything else our members are interested in. We're always looking for new experiences, so suggestions are welcome and encouraged. At this time, most of our meetups take place during weekends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We hope you will join us.

Grief counseling groups were helpful for me in the early stages of my personal griefing process, but now that I've found peace with being a survivor I'd like to work to bring some of us together to be able to appreciate the people we've become and how we've changed from our personal experience with suicide. For me, this group is for survivors who are interested in a survivor social group to spend time with (coffee, drinks, movies, hiking, etc) as opposed to a pure grief counseling\/support group. If the event is still very raw and\/or recent for you, then I don't believe that this social group would be the group for you.

Shooting on film is beautiful and as a Director\/Writer I love it but I've seen remarkable Motion Pictures shot on cell phones and full frame digital cameras. There are many ways to make it in the Film Industry: Write a screenplay - hand it to an agent; make a short - send it to a festival; go to film school - make commercials\/music videos; the key is MEET PEOPLE, WORK HARD TOGETHER, BE TENACIOUS and make films - don't talk about making them and what you would need and what you don't have etc. This group is for motivated creatives who want to make independent movies and built a network. We'll set meeting places to discuss projects. If we fall in love with a project we'll see if we can get funding and who can work on production. We'll pretty much scratch each other's backs and work on projects that we respect and earn respect for individual projects. There are lots of screenplays and ideas out there that haven't been made into a movie for one simple reason: THEY ARE EXPECTED NOT TO BE PROFITABLE.

It's true, some of the best jobs are never advertised. Many are filled by successful job seekers who networked with the right people and got the job before it was ever advertised. Employers love referrals and first look to tap their own workers for people they know that can fill open positions. It's cheaper and provides for more quality employees. People do business primarily with people they k9now and like. Resumes and cover letters alone are often too impersonal to convince employers to hire. Networking makes you a recommended member of a much smaller pool. Networking leads to information and job leads, often before a formal job description is created or a job is announced. There is more to successful networking than just talking to your friends.

Orage at the head. From that beginning, Mr. Nyland became dedicated to the practical application of Gurdjieff\u2019s Ideas for the rest of his life. He traveled several times to France to work with Gurdjieff, helped Gurdjieff when he made his various tater trips to America, and continued with his own personal efforts to apply what Gurdjieff taught as self-development, or work on oneself.<\/p>\n<p>Near the end of his life, Gurdjieff asked Mr. Nyland to start a group in America, for which he would receive special material every week. After Gurdjieff died in 1949, Mr. Nyland was one of the founders and trustees of the Gurdjieff Foundation. He remained active in the Foundation until he formed his own independent group in the early 1960s.<\/p>\n<p>In the late 1960s, Mr. Nyland established a center in the country, in Warwick, NY, where he purchased property now known as <span>Chardavogne Barn<\/span>. His group in California also purchased property in Sonoma county, near San Francisco, now known as <span>The Land<\/span>. At these and other branches of his group, he conducted many meetings, Gurdjieff movements, and workdays for physical activities.

Would you like to learn to get the joy from poems you get from other works of art without going through English Lit 101 again? If your answers are yes I can help. It started with a friend whom I met in discussion groups of Joyce\u2019s Ulysses and Proust\u2019s Remembrance of Things Past. He loved literature and music (he was a Jazz musician and is very knowledgeable about classical music as well). Yet, though he knew there was great beauty in poetry, he just didn\u2019t \u201cget\u201d it. We started discussing poetry in general and soon began weekly discussions of specific great poems. The challenge for me was how to make poetry come alive to him yet cover the critical components of poetry in a meaningful and interesting way\u2014to help him enjoy the beauty in Poetry that he enjoyed so much in literature and music. These discussions have been a great success and a great joy to both of us. He has come to love poetry with the same passion he has felt for music and literature. Now I\u2019d like to share with others what we learned. So, I am starting a Peotry discussion group\u2014I will facilitate but it\u2019ll be discussions not lectures or lessons. Together we will learn to understand and then love great poems. If you are interested, just join the Great Poetry group on Meetup. As soon as we have 5 or more members I will contact you and we\u2019ll pick a schedule and a venue in Manhattan and then we\u2019ll start.

Moreover, we will interview investors to give you information on what they are looking for and what they want to see in your startup.

Gail Mae is a Certified Level 3 Advanced EFT Practitioner and Workshop Leader. She has been facilitating workshops and working with clients in NYC now for over 5 years. EFT is a simple but powerful self-help tool that aims to clear energetic blocks that cause the physical or emotional issue. Everyone can learn to do it for themselves, and continue using it after the sessions. Improvements can often be felt in a very short time, in fact participants get relief and results during the evening. I know that some people are suffering enormous stress and worry. Come and learn this simple technique to not only help yourself but also have support from the group.There is power in numbers through what we call \"Borrowing Benefits. Come and learn more about it.

If you are looking for a group of cool girls to hit the bars with, but want to leave the drama behind then this may be the group for you. The rules of this group are very simple: 1. Do not bring drama - it will not be tolerated! 2. Show up ready to have fun! I will not be taking attendance at events or kicking anyone out for not attending enough events. This has always seemed ridiculous to me. I wouldn't stop being friends with someone just because they couldn't hang out one night and I'll give you that same respect. That said, you'll obviously get more out of the group and make more solid friendships if you attend events on a regular basis. The events will mostly consist of happy hours, weekend nights out, brunches, etc. Every event doesn't have to involve drinking, but we're young and living in one of the greatest cities in the world so why not live it up while we can! Also, just because I am the organizer doesn't mean that I am the only one who can plan events. I want group members to feel free to suggest\/plan things to do. So if you're looking to make new friends, drink a few cocktails and have some fun nights out then join us at our next meetup! Can't wait to meet you!

This group is open to anyone with an open mind of course and all earth based religions. People from other locations will still find interest in this group, but to meet up with would be a challenge! I would like to start meeting up at the local venues where here in Nassau County! My local library is RVC public library, and another few venues where we can meet up are local parks, Dinners, and Bars for adult only nights. Of course we are always going to expand the venues as more meet ups are scheduled! So far we meet up once a month for individuals and or their families to come on the last Saturday of every month at the Baldwin Coach Dinner located in Baldwin on Sunrise Hwy, across from the Baldwin Train Station. Eventually I would like to make those meet ups twice a month so we can discuss possible fund raisers to light of our pockets so we can plan trips and activities. As of right now we meet once a month and come together to discuss topics of interest, problems that might be affecting you or others in the community, and sort of community service that we could suggest, and or activities, as well as future events and meetings. I would like to start children's book readings again which we will start out as once every other week and depending on the outcome we will either make it once a month or or even better would be every week! Of course with that in mind for children I would like to start arts and crafts again now that the holidays are nearing and there are many things we can plan so they can have fun!

Founded by a production company in New York with tithes to some big names in entertainment, its our goal to do one thing and one thing only...make films. Just a few examples of our works to come: private film screenings, script readings, film premieres, film shoots (shorts and features) and not to mention getting to know one another on a close personal level.

And Manhattan in all its variety will be our playground.<\/p>\n<p>My intent is to put together a group of regulars, and together we will be set ourselves on a path of self education in photography. This group is for you if (a) you have the dedication and time to devote to photography, (b) have a digital camera with manual settings, (c) open to constructive criticism of your work.\u00a0The current plan is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>One meeting will be to discuss composition. I have chosen Michael Freeman's series: The Photographer's Eye. We will discuss one chapter, and take\/share photographs illustrating the materials.<\/li>\n<li>The second meeting will be to discuss exposure. This is much easier to learn, so in the future we will probably have a combination of other digital or technical issues like Lightroom.<\/li>\n<li>I'd also like to put together informal photowalks over some weekends to actually go out and practice what we learn. These plans will evolve as we come together as a group.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So if you are a dedicated amateur with the time to devote and looking for similar minded people,welcome and see you all at the next meeting.<\/p>","lon":-74.0100021362,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/a\/8\/highres_185583752.jpeg","photo_id":185583752,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/a\/8\/600_185583752.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/a\/8\/thumb_185583752.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":2964657,"name":"Dyutiman Das"},"members":64,"name":"A Walk in Paradise Garden","id":6142972,"state":"NY","urlname":"A-Walk-in-Paradise-Garden","category":{"name":"photography","id":27,"shortname":"photography"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Sharp Shooters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1354829935000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"linux","name":"Linux","id":188},{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"python","name":"Python","id":1064},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"test-driven-development","name":"Test Driven Development","id":25435},{"urlkey":"selenium","name":"Selenium","id":27921},{"urlkey":"software-qa-and-testing","name":"Software QA and Testing","id":42277},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"test-automation","name":"Test Automation","id":65172}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Testing-With-Python\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>We are a group who meets to discuss using Python for test automation and quality assurance purposes.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","members":108,"name":"Python Testing","id":6143142,"state":"NY","urlname":"Testing-With-Python","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Testers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1354833838000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"finance","name":"Finance","id":22467},{"urlkey":"quantitative-finance","name":"Quantitative Finance","id":34637},{"urlkey":"algorithmic-trading","name":"Algorithmic Trading","id":37627},{"urlkey":"algorithms","name":"Algorithms","id":111155},{"urlkey":"trading-with-automated-trading-systems","name":"Trading with Automated Trading Systems","id":139531}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Algorithmic-Trading\/","rating":4.32,"description":"<p>NYC Algorithmic Trading is for anyone interested in creating and using algorithms in the financial markets.

All I can say is you have to experience it for yourself. There is power in simplicity,love, and truth. Despite some language barriers(which are minor) You can feel her love and healing energy. Open your mind and see with a different set of eyes. I highly recommend her special Saturday classes.\" Michelina (Bodhi Meditation class Saturday November 15, 2014)<\/p>\n<p>\"Bodhi meditation has a focus on healing energy, you can experience this at each session.\u00a0Much higher level of meditation in group than I can achieve doing my own practice.\u00a0I was very happy to find a meditation group that was focused on bringing together community members to practice meditation. Bodhi meditation is unique because they offer free sessions to the community. Nan is a wonderful teacher, and very compassionate person. You can sense that she has extensive experience in oriental medicine including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and energy healing,.

To that end I am opening my house in Windsor Terrace Brooklyn for a once-or-twice-a-month get-together to anyone who would like to share in these activities. Whether you are an accomplished gamer, artist, and musician, or a novice that can barely play an instrument or draw, and never played Scrabble or Boggle in your life, you will fit in just fine. All evening long there will be figure drawing in the living room, live acoustic music in the foyer, and various board games in the dining room--and wine and cheese aplenty. Bring your drawing materials and\/or an acoustic instrument (flutes, violins, voice, percussion, cellos, autoharps, digideroos, rain sticks, sitars, etc.--whatever you've got!) or just come for the games or just to hang out. The music jams will be loosely-structured new age\/world music style improvisations around simple chord progressions and scales and will be easy enough that anyone--even if you can only play a single note--can join in. The figure drawing will be for practice only--no formal instruction. There will be one or two nude models posing throughout the evening in short poses and long poses. No paints or anything too messy please as the drawing session will be in a living room (not an art studio). Attendance at each Barefoot Fete will be limited to 20 people in order to maintain a gentle uncrowded vibe.

In relationships and love, it can help you to identify your soul mate. In the workplace as an employer, to find the best person for the job and as a parent or child, to understand those family dynamics that frustrate and infuriate us all.<\/p>\n<p><em>Talk about turning the odds in your favor.<\/em> Come learn the ancient science of face reading, develop the tools to discover your soul mate, and meet others on the same journey.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : small\"><strong>What are the benefits to learning Facial Analytics?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Three components make up the basic process.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>First - the attempt to understand who this individual in front of you is? What are they about? How can you as a teacher, leader, or healer best serve them?<\/p>\n<p>Secondly - the process of learning to read faces has the effect of opening the heart energy. This increases our capacity for practicing compassionate comprehension. The magic of reading faces is that it can generate deep, empathic reasoning, and this makes it possible to contain the person deeply, ie. to contain their whole being in the space of your heart. It is truly an extraordinary thing to learn and teach others this ability to understand someone deeply and completely, free of our usual habit of trying to fit someone into a preconceived box.<\/p>\n<p>The third thing that occurs when you learn to face read in this deeply empathic manner, is that you become healed yourself. You begin to understand that your experiences are shared, we are all sharing in the frailties and foibles of life with everyone around us. You will feel less alone, and perhaps more importantly, realize that we are all innocent victims of our environmental conditions. You will realize that even your parents who may have disappointed you (or worse), and even those who have hurt you, are innocent victims of the conditions of their environment.<\/p>\n<p>While this does not mean that we will externally condone dysfunctional behavior, it will make it easier to internally forgive it.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size : small\">About Atma, your Facial Analytics instructor.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/0\/b\/e\/event_193388382.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : right\"><\/span>Atma has been studying this emerging science of face reading for 13 years.

I love to write, but I feel that its too hard to do it on my own. I feel that writing in a group environment keeps me motivated. Something about a deadline and a group to share and critique my work with makes me feel inspired. I started this group in hopes that I find local girls who share my interest in inspiring subjects to write about and sharing our work with each other in hopes that our compliments and critiques could help us all become better writers. How it works: a few girls meet up after being assigned a specific theme to write about. We share our stories and then give each other critiques and compliments. we can focus on anything that you feel you need extra help in. The reason why its a girls only group is for a few reasons. One: I find a lot of mixed meet ups tend to turn into a place to hook up, I do not want that, all I want are girls who want to write. Two: Sometimes its hard to share certain feelings and thoughts in front of the opposite sex, heck sometimes its hard to do it in front of same sex, so lets not make it double uncomfortable. And third: I run a girls only book club and I love the topics of some of our conversations, sometimes they are things that most guys wouldn't dare discuss with a girl and I kind of want to bring that openness into my writing group as well.

Yet not taking an honest try at answering it (or even worse: ignoring the question entirely) can lead to the risk of misliving one's life. One of the main goals of ancient philosophy in the West was to help guide people in answering this question rigorously and well, and then helping people to live in accordance with their life's philosophy (literally \"the love of wisdom\").<\/p>\n<p>One of the most successful and influential schools of thought in the ancient world which addressed this question was Stoicism. Stoicism taught that by cultivating personal excellence ('<em>arete<\/em>' in Greek) was all that was needed to lead a good life and flourish as a human being ('<em>eudaimonia<\/em>' in ancient Greek). To do this, the ancient Stoics taught a host of practices and a sophisticated theory of mind to help the Stoic student on the path to <em>eudaimonia<\/em>. Stoic philosophy had a huge influence on the West, from helping shape early Christianity to being a strong influence on the modern psychological movement of cognitive-behavioral therapy.<\/p>\n<p>But Stoic philosophy is not only useful for those in the ancient world. For instance, James Stockdale has cited Stoic philosophy as helping him cope with the horrors of being a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Also, the University of Exeter in the UK has conducting pilot studies starting in 2012 of the effect of Stoic practices on various measures psychological well-being with promising preliminary results. Stoicism can be of great use to people in our modern era.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of this meetup is to introduce Stoic philosophy as a way of life to people interested in living a more meaningful, tranquil life and to support experienced students of Stoic philosophy in their practice. While many of the meetups will be focused around reading, this is not a group for disengaged study of ancient philosophy from an academic perspective. Instead, this is a group for helping people to put Stoic philosophy into practice in their daily lives, so they can live the best life they can.<\/p>\n<p>Are you ready to attempt to live a more tranquil, meaningful, and happy life? Then join us today!<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/b\/c\/8\/highres_194088072.jpeg","photo_id":194088072,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/b\/c\/8\/600_194088072.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/b\/c\/8\/thumb_194088072.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10063982,"name":"Greg"},"members":153,"name":"New York City Stoics","id":6549102,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-City-Stoics","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.6699981689,"who":"Stoics"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Jersey City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1357625384000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"expatfilipinos","name":"Expat Filipino","id":1767},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"philippines","name":"Philippines","id":25005},{"urlkey":"filipino","name":"Filipino","id":25244},{"urlkey":"hoboken","name":"Hoboken","id":42476},{"urlkey":"filipino-moms","name":"Filipino Moms","id":55227},{"urlkey":"jersey-city","name":"Jersey City","id":57300},{"urlkey":"pinay-moms","name":"Pinay Moms","id":64961},{"urlkey":"new-in-jersey-city","name":"New in Jersey City","id":104605},{"urlkey":"filipino-kids-playdates","name":"Filipino Kids Playdates","id":165434}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Young-Filipino-Moms-Dads-New-in-Jersey-City\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This is a support group for young Filipino moms &amp; dads who are on an H1 and H4 visa and newly based in Jersey City\/New York area.

Creating community is essential for recovery and \"What we can't do alone, we can do together.\"<br>\n\nSay hi, introduce yourself and know you are never alone. I am in service and available to anyone on this path of recovery and who are willing, honest and open-minded. You can message me on meetup, by email cindee@cindeerifkin.com or text 917-402-6606. Who am I? I am a sober (11 years) woman living a life of gratitude and service. My addictions to alcohol, drugs, sex, porn, food, people and gambling brought me to my knees. I turned my struggles and pain into my greatest allies and I am hopeful you can too. I believe that my connection to the god of my understanding and daily self-care practices bring me the spiritual fitness I need to create defenses against my addictions because without them I am doomed. I romanced the Big Book as it has the clearest directions on how to recover from alcoholism and for me all my addictions. It is how I guide my sponsees to walk hand and hand with their HP and to live in the sunlight of their spirit. It is a sacred text just like Patanjali's Yoga Sutra or the Bhagavad Gita which I also have studied. I have become a Self-care Educator and I bring an array of skills to my clients that they use in their daily lives. Simple but not easy, we can complicate anything but with yoga and the 12-Steps, daily miracles are happening. Everything is a blessing and or an opportunity, I am no longer the victim of anything but the creator of everything. I hope you can join us on the road of happy destiny, a life of gratitude, joy, fun and freedom.

Our mission is to educate and enlighten communities about the complex history and cultures of the indigenous peoples of the Philippines. Through the use of an artistic medium, which preserves the cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples from these regions, we seek to explore universal issues of the value of oral history, power, gender relations and environmental degradation that resonate with the current struggles of these indigenous peoples, but which also are shared concerns throughout the world. Since its founding, Kinding Sindaw has actively performed and provided cultural workshops and educational programs at venues throughout the city. These include full-scale dance-dramas: \"Irimun o Banag\", \"Agama Niyog\", \"Rajah Mangandiri\", \"Lemlunay\", \"Sultan Kudarat\", and \"Bembaran\". Venues have included La Mama ETC, Lincoln Center, The Puffin Room, Riverside Church, Mulberry Street Theatre, Wave Hill and NY area colleges. Additionally, we provide storytelling workshops at NYC area colleges, libraries (Jackson Heights Community Library) and museums (Met, Museum of Natural History, Asia Society). By presenting the rich and varied complexity of the indigenous peoples of the Philippines, we have been able to work with a variety of different community organizations and groups, and serve as a resource to help educate youth and adults.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to existing workshops, Kinding Sindaw seeks to deepen and enrich the participant\u2019s knowledge about Philippine history and culture, through a series of immersive arts and cultural workshops, led by Potri Ranka Manis, the founder and executive director of Kinding Sindaw. These workshops and classes will interweave the teaching of music, dance and martial arts movements with the history and struggles of the different indigenous tribes of the Philippines. Consequently, through this deep and active engagement, the participant will discover the tremendous significance of preserving the indigenous arts, culture, traditions and history of the Philippines, while becoming a tradition-bearer herself, capable of educating future generations and asserting her rightful place in our modern society.<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/0\/highres_196381952.jpeg","photo_id":196381952,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/0\/600_196381952.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/0\/thumb_196381952.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":75408942,"name":"Angela Torregoza"},"members":26,"name":"Kinding Sindaw Cultural and Arts Educational Workshops","id":6709502,"state":"NY","urlname":"Kinding-Sindaw-Cultural-and-Arts-Educational-Workshops","category":{"name":"dancing","id":5,"shortname":"dancing"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Kinding Sindaw"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1358453869000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"witi","name":"Women in Technology","id":10296},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"womens-business-networking","name":"Women's Business Networking","id":21283},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"social-issues","name":"Social Issues","id":31364}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Active-Women-Starters\/","rating":4.36,"description":"<p><span><strong>Active Women Starters (AWS)<\/strong>:<\/span> <span>Active women for progress and entrepreneurship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>A a group of female entrepreneurs, women in business, and their supporters located in NYC.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Mission statement:<\/strong> Foster women's empowerment, genuine sisterhood, and entrepreneurship in the NY metro area.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Values:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Supporting each other, for all the right reasons.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing yourself before you know others.<\/p>\n<p>Treating others with respect.<\/p>\n<p>Actively practicing true leadership.<\/p>\n<p>This group is for women and men who want to do big things, change the world, live fully, fund progress whether it be energetically or monetarily.

We do this in an atmosphere of welcome, acceptance and empathy. We meet the 2nd Thursday of the month at the LGBT Community Center in New York City. We encourage members to talk from our own personal experience. We want the group to be a safe space and we encourage confidentiality, as much as is humanly and realistically possible. We encourage interaction, discussion and friendship, but we shy away from telling someone what they should do. We discuss anxiety, depression, OCD, loneliness, relationship issues, etc. We meet at a restaurant about two weeks after the center meeting. The restaurant is a less formal, more social get-together. We have recently added a support group meeting at a West Village church on the first Wednesday of the month. (The church has graciously offered us this space to use, but by no means are we advocating any particular religion.)The group is a joint effort among all members. The group is for LGBTQ people. We would like group attendance to reflect our diversity. We have a diverse group of facilitators with respect to gender, age, and ethnicity.

We live in an over indulging, unhealthy eating, and sluggish society. In this group you will get the support you need to eat healthy, exercise, think positively, and make friends who want the same thing, supporting positive friends for life. We are in our infancy stages as the group has just began, but I have faith that the group will be a strong, focused, tight knit group of members supporting each other in a very important goal, to be healthy inside and out. I encourage all members to have a Health journal where you mainly record any exercise activity you do through each week, record your weight (which you don't have to share at the meetings) and record your daily food intake. You can also jot down in your journal things you may have learned that you can share with the group. We will discuss different subjects at each meeting, ie: healthy eating, diet plans, food and health information, emotional eating, body image, exercise tips, renewing your mind to help you stay focused, plus many other topics. You will also have my support via phone call or email and the support of other members in the group. About Me and Why I started this Group: When I was younger I was very active and as I became older I realized how important it was to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle. I\u2019ve always maintained a Nutritional Diet for the most part and practice eating healthy foods. But when I started to look around me I realized what an unhealthy society we live in and I want to help others achieve more than society's standard. So, as you and I know, it is so very difficult to do this alone. Most of us need encouragement and support and accountability. I am just like you all, down to earth and REAL~ We will begin this journey together. Currently there is not fee, this may need to change in the future, depending on the groups needs.\u00a0 As the Organizer, I am here for you anytime to email or call me for anything you need, including suggestions, concerns, ideas, and questions.This is a group for anyone interested in starting or maintaining a healthy lifestyle and wishing to make new friends.<\/p>","lon":-74.25,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/b\/0\/highres_202069072.jpeg","photo_id":202069072,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/b\/0\/600_202069072.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/b\/0\/thumb_202069072.jpeg"},"join_mode":"closed","members":46,"name":"A Healthy You of Northern NJ","id":7025782,"state":"NJ","urlname":"A-Healthy-You","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.9500007629,"who":"Healthy friends"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Clifton","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1360007958000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"business","name":"Business","id":10575},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"referral-marketing","name":"Referral Marketing","id":16745},{"urlkey":"business-connections","name":"Business Connections","id":21859},{"urlkey":"b2b-networking","name":"B2B Networking","id":65792}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Jersey-Business-Professionals\/","rating":4.35,"description":"<p>Calling all businesses in Northern New Jersey that want an exclusive opportunity to network and get referrals for your business.

This would include physicians, dentists, chiropractors, nurses, physician assistants, biomedical engineers, etc. Members include healthcare entrepreneurs, investors, service providers, and industry representatives.

I am guitar teacher at the University of Pennsylvania and teach and perform in New York. I love music and have been playing and teaching for most of my life. I am starting to give group guitar classes out of my place in Crown Heights on thursdays and sundays in a fun, relaxed atmosphere. I teach and play a lot of different styles, from rock\/pop to classical, basic jazz, and Middle Eastern music. I will start with one beginner class and one intermediate. In the intermediate class I'll focus on getting people to be able to play together, solo, and pick up music by ear and follow each other. The beginner class will be teaching the very basics of guitar. Each class will be an hour long and be 25 per person, capped at 5 people. Besides these, I want to open other more specialized classes soon.

It is for every body, age, physical ability.

Anyone who wants to play great works of orchestral literature can do so with us. When possible, we play from the exact same editions that the great orchestras of the world play from. So, next time you hear the first movement of Mozart's 40th Symphony being played on WQXR, you will recognize your part and say, \"Hey, I can play that...sort of!\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>Our Conductor:<\/strong> Conductor Benjamin Niemczyk is understanding, patient, and brings us together in the spirit of making great music. There are more than a few wrong notes here and there and he doesn't yell at us, we just keep trying. So come play with us no matter how long it's been.

We welcome musicians who have an adventurous spirit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you are a pro:<\/strong> We are an all-volunteer ensemble whose musicians do not get paid to perform, nor do we pay \"ringers\" to play with us. If you're a professional musician or a really awesome amateur and want to play with us, that's great! But we don't pay in cash, let's just get that out of the way. Your payment will be the great feeling of playing with a group of enthusiastic music lovers, and a little fame if that's your thing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NewWSO is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization<\/strong> and is a \"pay to play\" ensemble. Your first rehearsal is free of charge, to see if you like the repertoire and the people.

However, if a financial contribution is not possible for you, we can work something out.

The aim of creating this group is to understand Islam in the light of Quran and the teachings of the Holy Prophet(p.b.u.h) and his family, God willing\/inshAllah, to gain the pleasure of God and seek nearness to Him. Let's educate ourselves about the beauty of Islam and bring it deeper into our lives. Islam is the religion of knowledge, it is a guide to the straight path from darkness into the light. The first aayah of the Qur\u2019an to be revealed enjoined reading which is the key to knowledge. God\/Allah (SWT) says: \u201cRead! In the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists). He has created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood). Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught (the writing) by the pen. He has taught man that which he knew not\u201d [al-\u2018Alaq 96:1-5] Islam calls us to seek knowledge. The Prophet (PBUH) made seeking knowledge an obligation upon every Muslim. The Prophet of Allah (saaw) was asked: \u201cWhat is Knowledge?\u201d He replied: \u201cto keep silent\u201d. He was asked: \u201cThen?\u201d He said: \u201cto listen attentively\u201d. He was asked: \u201cThen?\u201d He said: \u201cto remember\u201d. He was asked: \u201cThen?\u201d He said: \u201cto act upon (what is learned)\u201d. He was asked: \u201cThen?\u201d He said: \u201cto propagate\u201d. [Al-Majlisi, Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 2, p. 28] There is no goodness in knowledge which is not confirmed by action, or words which are not confirmed by deeds:Allah says: \u201cO you who believe, why do you say what you do not do? It is most hateful to Allah for you to say what you do not do.\u201d [S\u00fbrah al-Saff: 2-3] So let us learn Islam : the perfect way of life and and bring it into our deeds and actions.
