      "description": "<p>NUTSHELL - every week day, 12:15ish until 1:45ish, Cumnock Turf Fields at Harvard Stadium, games of 4v4 up to 10v10 or larger depending on who shows, bring a white shirt and a dark/colored shirt (but not a gray one), almost never canceled, read below for more details before asking questions that are answered here, and read the comments for today's meetup to see if there is anything important about today.</p> <p><a href=\"http://goo.gl/I0tPQQ\"><a href=\"http://goo.gl/I0tPQQ\" class=\"linkified\">http://goo.gl/I0tPQQ</a></a></p> <p>GETTING THERE BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT - Harvard Square is the closest T stop (red line).  Check Google Maps or other to find fastest way there from wherever you are.</p> <p>GETTING THERE BY RIDE SHARE - a lot of players in this meetup come by car and are nice enough to offer rides to others. Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.</p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium.  They will patrol for cars parked illegally.</p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.</p> <p>ATTIRE - Bring a *white* shirt and a dark/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams.  DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine.  Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.</p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better.  That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled.  Check here right before heading over.</p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes.  Most people playing do this for fun and/or exercise in the middle of the day.  Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:</p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely return to the office/class afterward.</p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.</p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball. </p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony/legal matter.</p> <p>WHAT ELSE - All skill levels welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest updates for today's meetup.</p>",

Each block party will feature music from a different local band, along with a cash bar. The parties take place each week from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. at Dewey Square Park and once a month at Summer Street Plaza at Downtown Crossing.</p> <p>“We select bands for the block parties in a few different ways,” says Boston Calling co-founder Brian Appel. “We consult local press in the area to get an outside perspective, we allow bands to submit music over social media, and we often choose bands that we have worked with in the past, including Tigerman WOAH, who are kicking off this year’s series.”</p> <p>MAPS &amp; Directions: <a href=\"http://www.rosekennedygreenway.org/about-us/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.rosekennedygreenway.org/about-us/</a></p>",

Please be on time and only sign up if you're sure you can be here.</p> <p><br/><b>Limited to four attendees. </b>In this workshop, we'll read your work and take <b>more time</b> than in a standard group workshop to go into <b>deeper detail</b> regarding how to strengthen it. From larger structural and character considerations to minor formatting and story bumps, we'll go page by page and suggest how to make your script tighter, evocative, and more compelling. </p> <p><br/>Please bring at least four copies of ONE of the following:</p> <p>1. Ten pages of an original feature screenplay (or a ten or less-page short film) that you wrote yourself.<br/>2. A treatment that you wrote yourself (one to two-page synopsis of the plot) for a proposed original screenplay. Please keep treatments to two pages maximum.</p> <p><br/>If you haven't written a script or treatment, then come with your questions and a willingness to provide constructive feedback for others.</p> <p><br/>Regardless of what you bring, be sure to <b>PRINT OUT COPIES</b> so that we can read it together. If you don't print them out, we'll have no way to workshop your work! At least four would be appreciated.</p> <p>If you haven't written a screenplay or treatment but are curious about the process, then we definitely have a place for you.

      "description": "<p>Rita Hunter McGrath of the Columbia Business School has theorized that we are at the <a href=\"http://ritamcgrath.com/books/the-end-of-competitive-advantage/\">end of competitive advantage</a>.  The gold standard for business strategy for many years was “sustainable competitive advantage” - capturing a market or niche through and then extending that advantage.  Companies following this script are going out of business.  Those companies who have thrived through the shifts in human behavior resulting from the digital revolution are using a different script: focus on continuous innovation.</p> <p>Continuous innovation is a core set of corporate practices that involve strategy leadership and operational iteration; it includes continuous reconfiguration, options valuation, healthy disengagement, but, above all, building an innovation proficiency.</p> <p>In the frame of digital transformation, the innovation proficiency is what we must envision and practice.  The leading edge of this practice is pairing “cloud native applications” with “continuous delivery of business value,” as pioneered by Amazon and Netflix, and now demonstrated by many others including Allstate, GE, and Lockheed Martin.</p> <p><i>Cloud native applications</i> are run in the cloud and on myriad input and output devices, built from scratch with assumptions of mobile and IoT clients.  These also use information and processes from legacy systems (“systems of record”) but do so in a way that protects rather than exposes them; cloud native applications should run against a “digital platform”. </p> <p><i>Continuous delivery of business value</i> is the right-sizing of digital innovation.  Like the lean manufacturing movement in Japan, it shrinks the size of the tools and team to focus on cycle time optimization rather than volume of production.  There are two key dimensions: people and tools.  The people dimension is realized by creating 8-10 person groups that break silos with members of every type of organization on a single team. </p> <p>These people and tools come together to build a stack of practices: continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous innovation - a system in which collective experience across the team and its customers is rapidly iterated to deliver more business value with each turn of the cycle.</p> <p>These practices appear to be an empirically demonstrated pattern for successful digital transformation: continuous innovation supported by an enterprise digital platform.</p>",

Given the highly sensitive information that exists in their environments — including patient data, personally identifiable information, and all manner of intellectual property — there is an increasing interest in understanding the threat surface and finding ways to secure it. From cloud infrastructure to spear phishing, this talk will present a framework for understanding how to understand attack patterns and proactively respond.</p> <p><b>About Kevin.</b> CEO and founder of <b>GreatHorn</b>, Kevin O'Brien has been working in the security industry for nearly two decades. He has been an early stage executive at multiple startups, including security pioneers <b>CloudLock</b>, <b>@stake</b>, and <b>Conjur</b>. He has been featured nationally as a guest speaker on NPR's <b>MarketPlace Money</b> (where he provided insight into the Target data breach), written for <b>Tom's Guide</b> about the biometric (in)security of Apple's iPhone 6, and been cited by <b>BuzzFeed</b> on the evolution of the cloud security market, and he is a frequent panelist and moderator within the infosec industry. In addition to his role at GreatHorn, Kevin sits on <b>MassTLC</b>'s security advisory board.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>2.  Improving the State of Healthcare Information Security as a Security Investigator (7:10-7:30) </b></p> <p>by Roy Wattanasin | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wr0\">Twitter</a></p> <p>Last year was rough for data security in the healthcare industry; per the Ponemon Institute, about 43 percent of breaches in 2014 came from the healthcare industry. The FBI has warned that hackers are or will be targeting these organizations, and 2015 already has brought one of the largest healthcare breaches reported to date.</p> <p>This talk highlights the top healthcare breaches and walks you through them, diving into the role of security investigator (using public information): reviewing how/why each breach happened, when it was discovered, who discovered it, how many people were impacted, and what the organization did to assist them. This talk will also offer recommendations on preventing breaches and engage in a dialogue with the audience. “Time is inevitable, but knowledge and pro-activeness is on your side.\"</p> <p><b>About Roy.</b> Roy Wattanasin is a healthcare information security professional and an adjunct faculty member at <b>Brandeis University</b>. He spends most of his time leading, teaching, and developing information security programs; finding vulnerabilities; performing incident response; and working on many projects. Roy is credited for bringing back <b>Security BSides Boston</b> in 2012, where he was lead organizer for more than three years and now serves as an adviser. Roy enjoys contributing to the community by creating new learning opportunities and conferences. Roy has been an active member of <b>Boston Security Meetup</b> since its early days; he presented the tool of the month and created the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/securitymeetup\">@securitymeetup</a> Twitter account.</p> <p><br/><b>3.  Operating Docker Securely for Speed and Profit</b> (7:35-7:55)</p> <p>by Jen Andre | <a href=\"http://jenpire.com/\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fun_cuddles\">Twitter</a></p> <p>What’s old is new again: Docker has made containers the new hotness all over again. It’s been vaunted as another tool to make deployments faster and infrastructure simpler to manage. But with Docker’s popularity has come a lot of debate regarding whether or not Docker containers are safe for production deployments. As with most emerging technologies, this isn’t a question with a clear \"yes\" or \"no\" answer; it highly depends on your use case, and how you operationalize the technology.</p> <p>Out of the box, Docker integrates with Linux technologies natively (process capabilities, user namespaces, AppArmor, SELinux) that \"sandbox\" the activity a container can do. However, by default it does it in a generic, non-application-specific way. But you can do so much more!</p> <p>In this talk, Jen will give you an introduction to the Docker security model as it stands today, some possible pitfalls to be aware of, and how to work within that model to make sure you are not introducing risk. She’ll discuss interesting knobs and whistles you can configure (such as AppArmor profiles) to harden your containers, and some interesting open-source tools that make that job easier.</p> <p><b>About Jen. </b>In addition to being co-founder at cloud-security company <b>Threat Stack</b>, Jen has worked in R&amp;D at catch-the-bad-guys company <b>Mandiant </b>and as a security analyst and software engineer at <b>Symantec</b>. Jen loves security, open source, and automation, and she especially loves where these things intersect (which is why she likes to talk security at ops-related conferences and blog about these subjects all over the place).</p> <p><b>4.

After a gentle start with a simple schema and some basic queries, we will explore some more sophisticated concepts like rules, aggregates, expressions, and pulling.</p> <p>At the end of the workshop, we will take a step back an look at the architecture, deployment options and Datomic's place in Clojure's ecosystem.<br/><i><b><br/>Please bring your laptop with Leiningen and your favorite Clojure editor installed if you want to follow the examples hands-on. </b></i></p> <p><b>Bio: </b><br/>Jochen works as full-time Clojure/Java developer at Infinite Cloud - a small consulting company based in the Pioneer Valley.

We meet monthly forming a Reiki community dedicated to the practice and study of Reiki as we share how this powerful energy works in our lives.</p> <p>\n\nThe course will include understanding the Language of Symbols, the Language of Light, and the Language of Sound. Meditation and alignment of our chakras will enable us to access the Reiki energy more powerfully. Clearing and grounding energy will clear us for giving and receiving Reiki. We will also study and practice the recent information that has been written about the original Japanese Reiki techniques as practiced by Dr. Usui and continued in the Reiki community in Japan today.</p> <p>Each session will include practicing Reiki on each other.</p>",

I'm walkin' here!\"</p> <p>GETTING TICKETS: Get your ticket through the Regal Entertainment site, not the Fathom/Fandango one! (That one keeps saying it's sold out!)</p> <p><a href=\"http://goo.gl/xxKdo0\" class=\"linkified\">http://goo.gl/xxKdo0</a></p> <p>MEETING: We will meet in the main lobby at the top of the stairs at 7:30, and go in to get seats and watch the pre-movie slideshow at 7:40.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Boston CanvasCon is the first event of its kind to bring together Canvas-enthusiasts and newcomers who teach with Canvas. We're here to find common ground, to support each other in improving educational outcomes, and to learn to better use technology to engage our students, whether adult, traditional or K-12. Tracks for faculty bring you back to why you love teaching in the first place. We help you integrate technology better in the classroom, in ways that make sense for you and your students. Learn hands-on Canvas skills to make you a Canvas master. Gain confidence if your school has just moved to Canvas. Tracks will focus on learning the tools, teaching effectiveness, design thinking, and the coolest tech.<br/>Sessions<br/>More Sessions to Be Announced</p> <p>Universal Design in Canvas: Tools That Work<br/>Beth Ritter-Guth, Director of Instructional Design and Director of American Honors, Union County College</p> <p>Universal Design allows course materials to be fine tuned to individualized learning styles. UD provides accessible ways for students to receive content, manipulate content, and submit content. This interactive presentation will provide attendees with several tools that can be used to foster universal design within Canvas.</p> <p>Canvas and the Case Method: Canvas at HBS<br/>Paul Craig, Associate Director, Learning Technology Services, Educational Technology Services, HBS IT<br/>Andy Hyde, Instructional Designer, Educational Technology Services, HBS IT<br/>Jeanne Po, Director, Learning Technologies and Instructional Design Services, Educational Technology Services, HBS IT</p> <p>During this session, presenters will discuss how Harvard Business School is utilizing Canvas to support case-based teaching and learning, promote collaboration in new and meaningful ways, and share best practices and lessons learned and over the course of the Canvas pilot at HBS. Presenters will illustrate how the lessons learned in the pilot will be applied during the Canvas roll out at HBS.</p> <p>Can We Use Canvas for This?<br/>Molly Bonnard, Courseware Services Manager, University of Pennsylvania</p> <p>Once faculty and staff become comfortable using Canvas in their courses, interest will grow in using the LMS for other purposes since it is a tool \"everyone knows.\" Learn about the University of Pennsylvania's experience developing policies and providing support for non-course use of Canvas like placement exams, freshman orientation, and alumni groups.</p> <p>Teaching Mega-Courses with Canvas<br/>Larry Bouthillier, Instructor in Computer Science, Harvard Extension School. A programming course with over 200 students? Must be Coursera or codeacamy? No. It’s Canvas at Harvard. The course contains 100+ pages of designed content with a custom navigation scheme, several dozen assignments, Canvas-managed peer-review of student code by other students, weekly reflection surveys, 75+ instructional videos, and the use of external tools for managing class. See what you can learn for your own larger courses. Chiropractic Course Design: Making Sure Your Course is in Alignment<br/>Jean Marrapodi, Ph.D, Citizen's Bank and formerly, The New England College of Business</p> <p>Participants in this session will explore course mapping: aligning objectives, content, and assessments to ensure that the main purpose of an eLearning course remains the main purpose, and that we measure the appropriate outcomes. For faculty, you'll learn how to narrow down your subject and ensure you meet your goals and the learners succeed in class. \"You're Speakin' My Language\"<br/>Kate Hill, Director of Online Learning, Cincinnati Christian University In all educational arenas, we have one common goal: to educate students. However, many times Instructional Designers and Faculty don't speak the same language. Without experience on both sides of these positions, it is often difficult to understand and empathize with the unique issues that must be faced. So, how do we get Instructional Designers and Faculty on the same Canvas Front Page??</p>",

      "description": "<p>NUTSHELL - every week day, 12:15ish until 1:45ish, Cumnock Turf Fields at Harvard Stadium, games of 4v4 up to 10v10 or larger depending on who shows, bring a white shirt and a dark/colored shirt (but not a gray one), almost never canceled, read below for more details before asking questions that are answered here, and read the comments for today's meetup to see if there is anything important about today.</p> <p><a href=\"http://goo.gl/I0tPQQ\"><a href=\"http://goo.gl/I0tPQQ\" class=\"linkified\">http://goo.gl/I0tPQQ</a></a></p> <p>GETTING THERE BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT - Harvard Square is the closest T stop (red line).  Check Google Maps or other to find fastest way there from wherever you are.</p> <p>GETTING THERE BY RIDE SHARE - a lot of players in this meetup come by car and are nice enough to offer rides to others. Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.</p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium.  They will patrol for cars parked illegally.</p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.</p> <p>ATTIRE - Bring a *white* shirt and a dark/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams.  DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine.  Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.</p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better.  That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled.  Check here right before heading over.</p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes.  Most people playing do this for fun and/or exercise in the middle of the day.  Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:</p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely return to the office/class afterward.</p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.</p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.</p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony/legal matter.</p> <p>WHAT ELSE - All skill levels welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest updates for today's meetup.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",

This path is stroller friendly or you could carry your child. It is a little hilly, but appropriate for most fitness levels. We alternate walks between the inner and outer loops which are both under 3 miles. It usually takes less than an hour. We walk past a playground too, so we could stop and play there for a while. Afterwards, we sit at the picnic tables under the trees by the visitor center and feed our babies, chat, etc. </p> <p>We will meet outside the visitor center in the upper parking lot on the Saugus side of the park, past the Kasabuski Skating Rink.  There are bathrooms with a changing table in the visitor center too.</p> <p>Running late?  No prob. You can always meet up with us at the picnic tables next to the visitor center after we finish the walk. </p> <p>***By popular demand this is set as weekly event.  If the weather is bad we can change it to a different day or skip the week.</p>",

      "description": "<p>For New Members AND NON-Members:</p> <p>For every sailor who walks through our door, start here! This FREE Orientation class will get you familiar with how everything works at CBI. The orientation class is the gateway to everything that CBI has to offer, whether you’re a seasoned sailor or brand new to boats. Done entirely on the dock, your orientation will include a guided tour of CBI’s boats and facilities, an overview of our classes and programs, as well as plenty of time to ask the questions that matter to you as a sailor. All orientations meet at the base of the American Flag Pole out on the dock, and runs for about half an hour. All are welcome to this class!</p> <p><br/>Afterwards, we invite you to meet one another and ask about other Orientation class attendees' prior experience with sailing. Perhaps you can find a friend to take the Beginner Sailing classes together with once you join. </p> <p>Friday Nights are also when CBI members go out for Informal Racing, so it is an exciting night to watch the sailors and learn more about how you can progress your skills after learning to sail. Certainly ask your Orientation instructor about the Friday Night Informal Racing and Informal Instruction if he or she does not mention it. If you have any questions, please feel free to post below!</p>",

      "description": "<p>Open year round, dawn to dusk. Revere Beach, the oldest public beach in America, celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1996. Revere Beach faces Massachusetts Bay, five miles north of Boston. Its hard sand shore forms a great crescent along the blue ocean for miles, sloping away gradually out to sea, creating an ideal bathing beach. With the Nahant and Winthrop peninsulas framing the horizon, the distant lighthouses and the steamers passing far out to sea, the scenic panorama viewed from the beach by day or night is unsurpassed.</p> <p>A long flat sidewalk runs alongside the length of the beach, with covered seating areas available, a bathhouse, and a bandstand for summer concerts. Also along Revere Beach Boulevard are restaurants, ice cream shops, and, of course, Kelly's Roast Beef - a Revere Beach favorite.</p> <p>We will meet at 5:45 and start our walk at 5:50, so if you are running late, please catch up!</p> <p><br/><b>Directions: </b><br/>Revere Beach is on Revere Beach Boulevard, which is off Route 1A. From Route 128, you would take Rt 1, then Rt 60, then eventually Rt 1A to Revere Beach Boulevard. There is on-street parking the length of the beach, as well as streets parallel to Revere Beach Boulevard. There is also a large parking lot about halfway down the beach.</p> <p><b>Meet at: </b><br/>At the bandstand, which is at the south end of the beach (heading toward Boston).</p> <p><b>If you need to reach me to locate us: </b><br/>Call me on my cell:[masked]-4624.</p>",

Attendees lay comfortably on mats with pillows and blankets with the crystals around them on the floor as well as some placed on chakras. </p>",

      "description": "<p>Talented Psychic Medium Yulia Applewood presenting:</p> <p>PSYCHIC DEVELOPMENT CLASS<br/>Friday, June 5th, 2015 from 7:00pm to 9:00pm .... CALL TO SIGNUP[masked]<br/>In this class students will learn the basics of psychism and mediumship in a safe and supportive environment. Students will discover their own innate psychic skill and talents through a series of exercises designed to gently open the third eye and make them aware of the unseen world around them. This class will focus on psychic protection and spiritual hygiene and spiritual awareness and will be instrumental in identifying and developing the individual psychic skills of each student. We will also explore the wonders of mediumship and connect with the realm of spirit through a small group séance. In each class students will have the opportunity to experiment with different psychic tools and techniques along with learning a brief history about each practice. In the first class we will discuss Tarot cards and learn the systems behind the symbolism in the cards, which make them such a useful tool in divination. We will also experiment with dowsing, using both rods and pendulums to answer simple questions and find lost items, we will introduce as well the ancient art of scrying on liquid, flame and crystal surfaces. We will also delve into palmistry and learn how to be prepared for certain changes in our own lives by studying some of the major lines on our hands. We will learn how to read tea leaves and throw bones as well. Both of these famous systems from antiquity have complex histories and variations that will also be discussed. Cost: $25.00</p>",

Grey is evil. If you wear grey you may be asked to wear a light or dark \"pinnie of shame.\"</p> <p>Arrive on time to be guaranteed a spot in a game</p> <p>RSVP is recommended so you can be notified if the game is canceled</p> <p>Bring WATER!</p> <p>If you are a regular, please consider bringing a buck for the Frisbee Fund</p> <p>As usual, we will supply the frisbees, cones, first aid supplies (hopefully will never be used) and our pretty smiles.

I will add people that (1) answer all of the questions that are part of the RSVP process and (2) have done similar</b><b> hikes within the past three months.</b></p> <p><br/><b>What We're Doing...</b></p> <p><b>Glen Boulder</b> is one of my favorite trails in the Whites and taking Glen Boulder via Boot Spur is my favorite way to get to Mt. Washington so... that's what we're going to do. One of the things that makes the Glen Boulder Trail so wonderful is that it has one of the lowest tree lines in the Whites. The first leg of this hike will take us up to <b>Mt. Washington @ 6,288 feet</b> via Glen Boulder and Boot Spur gaining 4,678 feet of vertical in the process. The views are absolutely fantastic and while the car spotting is a little inconvenient, this part of the hike alone will make it 100% worth it! From the summit of Mt. Washington we will head southwest on the Crawford Path darting off occasionally to pick up a summit here and there. In addition to Mt. Washington we will also summit <b>Mt. Monroe at 5,372 feet</b>, <b>Mount Eisenhower at 4,760 feet</b>, and <b>Mount Pierce at 4,312 feet</b>. If the group is feeling REALLY great we may add Jackson to the list, but no promises.</p> <p><br/>Use this link for more information about the summits and trails:</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://trailsnh.com/peaks/nh/4000/1-Mt-Washington-6288\"><a href=\"http://trailsnh.com/peaks/nh/4000/1-Mt-Washington-6288\" class=\"linkified\">http://trailsnh.com/peaks/nh/4000/1-Mt-Washington-6288</a><br/></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://trailsnh.com/peaks/nh/4000/1-Mt-Washington-6288\">&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p>&lt;a href=\"http://trailsnh.com/peaks/nh/4000/1-Mt-Washington-6288\"&gt;• <a href=\"http://trailsnh.com/peaks/nh/4000/4-Mt-Monroe-5384\" class=\"linkified\">http://trailsnh.com/peaks/nh/4000/4-Mt-Monroe-5384</a></a></p> <p>• <a href=\"http://trailsnh.com/peaks/nh/4000/1-Mt-Washington-6288\"><a href=\"http://trailsnh.com/peaks/nh/4000/11-Mt-Eisenhower-4780--27-Mt-Pierce-4310\" class=\"linkified\">http://trailsnh.com/peaks/nh/4000/11-Mt-Eisenhower-4780--27-Mt-Pierce-4310</a><br/></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://trailsnh.com/peaks/nh/4000/18-Mt-Liberty-4459--25-Mt-Flume-4328\"><br/></a></p> <p><b>Guests are not permitted.</b></p> <p><br/><b>Dogs are permitted</b> - Just like humans, dogs need to be in good shape to do this hike.

      "description": "<p>This is the reoccurring meetup for the weekly open water swims at Walden Pond. A well attended venue for triathletes training for races of all distances.</p> <p>The gate opens at 7 a.m. and the Parking is right off of Walden St. Walden charges to park a their lot ($5) via a computerized parking attendant that takes cards. I'd recommend the annual pass if you think you're going to come to more meetups. Alternatively, <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Concord+High+School,+concord+ma&amp;daddr=915+Walden+Street,+Concord,+MA&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=38.93711,-75.966775&amp;sspn=13.846355,14.128418&amp;geocode=FRa1hwIdrlO_-yEidG069HujIg%3BFQqXhwIdjYW_-ylB1q82q5vjiTFsmsu3RKWVtQ&amp;gl=us&amp;mra=ls&amp;t=m&amp;z=16\">It's a short distance from Concord High School</a>. Some people avoid the parking fee by parking near Concord High School and then walk/ride their bike over to Walden. <a href=\"http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/trails/walden.pdf\">Click here for the map of the parking</a>.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/f/f/4/event_118056852.jpeg\" /></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Across and back from the beach (Pictured above) is a little over a mile mile; a perfect distance for those training for 70.3 and Ironman races.</p> <p>There are also some close to shore routes for people getting better acquainted with open water (see distance maps). We meet near the lifeguard house right on the beach closes to Walden street. Here is the map of walden pond.</p> <p>This meetup is important because you always want to swim in groups if you can. Make certain that you look out for each other. Don't attempt to swim across the pond if you haven't trained for that distance. Always match up with someone or a group that swims your pace. The beauty of Walden is that you can swim very close to shallow water and get some good open water training in.</p> <p>If there are people that are looking to go long for the first time, let me know in advance and I may be able to swim angel, or get a swim angel group together. That way we can do it in a controlled and safe environment.</p> <p>For those that are really new and nervous about open water swimming, stay tuned for a beginners clinic that I'll put on in the summer.</p>",

There is an optional loop at either the end or the beginning to Jeffery's Neck which extends to the total distance to 43 miles. We'll start from the Ipswich MBTA station. The ride can be viewed at the link below. This is a ramble. We will try to maintain an average moving speed of 13 - 15 mph. Of course the return may pick up speed and turn more into a romp 15+ mph.

Whatever you'd like!</p> <p>\"Pleasure Bay is an awesome area to enjoy the nice weather next to the ocean. It is well served by MBTA bus routes 5, 7, 9, 10, and 11, and usually has decent parking. Click here to see it on Google maps.</p> <p>\"We will be set up somewhere along the beach south of the traffic circle at the end of E Broadway (see image below).

Started by Pietro Caproni and his brother Emilio, they traveled around Europe making plaster molds of classical priceless sculpture, producing reproductions of the sculptures for schools and museums as well as the Boston Symphony Hall!</p> <p>The Giust Gallery is now owned and operated by a great sculptor in Woburn MA, They were recently hired to restore the Lion and Unicorn that is located at the old State House, remember the time capsule???!!</p> <p>This meet-up will be a visit to offer some information but also if you want to purchase a plaster cast.... They also sell sculpture supplies and materials for those who sculpt!</p> <p>YOU NEED A CAR TO GET THERE.<br/>I'm sure there is public transportation, but lets all aim for efficiency:) Suggestion: carpool a group to save time.</p> <p>We will need to organize transportation issues all in advance, so post a comment that you need help getting there, and back. I'm very excited to offer this event, I hope you all take a look and sign up!</p>",

We will meet, chat, RUN, stretch, chat, EAT BREAKFAST and then leave. It's that easy.</p> <p><b>Breakfast Details</b> : Between 11:15 and 11:30 (depending on how long we run) we will meet back at City Sports on Comm Ave. near Packards Corner for Pot Luck style brunch.</p> <p>Contribute to a great breakfast with an item to share with the group (eggs, bagels, fruits, muffins, juice, bacon, potatoes, etc.) You're not obligated to bring anything, though, so please join us for breakfast after the run anyway.</p> <p>ALL ABILITY LEVELS WELCOME!!!</p> <p>Secret parking is accessible in the Star Market parking lot (just make sure you walk through Star Market. No one has ever been towed.)</p> <p>Bring a friend, see you out there.</p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://www.informalrunning.com\">informalrunning.com</a></p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://informalrunning.blogspot.com\">Read the BLOG</a></p>",

      "description": "<p>(Almost) every month, the New England Science Fiction Association (NESFA) hosts an all-day gaming extravaganza at their clubhouse. They have a collection of hundreds of games, ranging from fillers to all-day affairs, and they usually break out 100+ of them for people to choose from. They also have a ridiculously enormous science fiction library their members can check out books from. Mike S. gave me permission to invite ALL of the cube pushers who would like to, to come by and check out the NESFA clubhouse on the game day and play a few games.</p> <p>Personally, I am trying to get an 18XX set up that day so I can teach a couple of the NESFA members who expressed an interest in it. Getting in some cube pushers would help me be able to introduce it to some new people and speed things along a bit. Be sure to arrive by noon sharp so we can get set up and get going if you want to play 18xx! Otherwise you can drop by anytime, though everyone might be in a long game if you don't come at the beginning. Caveat ludor!</p> <p><br/>The clubhouse is a great place for gaming and you'll find people with a variety of interests - I'm a basic member, it's pretty cheap for the year, and they even give you free snacks (soda, popcorn, water, and Bill T. frequently brings a big box of Dunkin donuts on game day). There's free parking in the back lot, but it fills up fast, so be on time if you're driving! Or better yet, you can use public transportation (bus lines 80, 89, 101; see <a href=\"http://www.nesfa.org/clubhouse/businfo.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.nesfa.org/clubhouse/businfo.html</a>). There are lots of restaurants nearby (Chinese, subs, and pubs) so if you want a bit more than tasty NESFA snacks, you won't go hungry. So come on by, and get to play some great games with some new and old faces.</p>",

One part of what makes it so great is our weekly roof deck tour. Each and every Saturday we'll be visiting a different roof deck for food, drinks, relaxation, and socializing. Please the details carefully every week, as the details are going to change. Some venues have better times to visit than others, and as already stated, each week will be in a different location...</p> <p><b>Our Fifth Stop...</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/7/9/5/600_437746997.jpeg\" /></p> <p>At Coppersmith, you’ll see accessibility in everything from the bar snacks (spiced Marcona almonds and beef jerky) and appetizers (confit chicken wings and a Bloomin’ Tempura Oyster Mushroom) to shareable family style meals like a pig roast, Moroccan lamb, and fried chicken dinner. Other offerings on Henry’s heavily locavore menu will include farmer’s market salads (some of which will be sourced from a vertical garden on the roof), hand-crafted Agnolotti, a soft shell crab BLT, grass-fed steak tip frites, a classic New England lobster roll, and seafood boils on the patios. On the rooftop deck is an Airstream trailer serving cocktails and raw bar mainstays—think oyster, clams, and crudos.</p> <p>This roof deck is so new that at the time of this posting, no photos could be found online except for the digital renderings shown here!</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/7/9/4/600_437746996.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>GETTING THERE</b></p> <p>Coppersmith is at 40 W 3rd Street, South Boston, MA, 02127.</p> <p>Click here for <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/40+W+3rd+St,+Boston,+MA+02127/@42.3424361,-71.0538482,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e37a7cceb4d529:0x31b04c91485770e1\">directions on Google</a>.

Please the details carefully every week, as the details are going to change.

Other offerings on Henry’s heavily locavore menu will include farmer’s market salads (some of which will be sourced from a vertical garden on the roof), hand-crafted Agnolotti, a soft shell crab BLT, grass-fed steak tip frites, a classic New England lobster roll, and seafood boils on the patios. On the rooftop deck is an Airstream trailer serving cocktails and raw bar mainstays—think oyster, clams, and crudos.</p> <p>This roof deck is so new that at the time of this posting, no photos could be found online except for the digital renderings shown here!</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/7/9/4/600_437746996.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>GETTING THERE</b></p> <p>Coppersmith is at 40 W 3rd Street, South Boston, MA, 02127.</p> <p>Click here for <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/40+W+3rd+St,+Boston,+MA+02127/@42.3424361,-71.0538482,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e37a7cceb4d529:0x31b04c91485770e1\"><b>directions on Google</b></a>.

Forget any ideas about crude battering on armour; the successful warrior strikes to the gaps and the openings of his or her opponent's attacks, and supplements this with disarms, throws, and other techniques which secure the advantage over larger or stronger attackers.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/e/c/0/event_198888832.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Around the year 1400, Fiore dei Liberi trained medieval knights and squires, and authored multiple books of medieval combat, <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/SSGBoston/pages/Beginning_Resources_%28Written%29/\">some of which have survived to the present day</a>. His method, <i>L'Arte d'Armizare</i> (the Art of Bearing Arms), shows an integrated and cross-referenced system of sword, dagger, grappling, spear &amp; lance, pollaxe and other weapons on foot and on horseback, with and without armour, and easily dispels any illusions that medieval combat was about unskilled strength.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/e/8/4/event_198888772.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Our beginners' course is four linked classes that give the basic techniques and vocabulary of <i>L'Arte</i>, and enables men and women to begin regular unarmoured training and learning.  No prior training needed; all class equipment is provided.</p> <p>So, come join the scholars and combatants of our company!</p> <p><i>(The price shown is for the set of all four classes (July 11, 18, 25, and Aug 1) and membership and registration.  Classes are not offered separately.  We'll send an email with some class materials before the first session.)</i></p>",

Its also a great event for meeting people.</p> <p><br/>After the event volunteers are encouraged to go to the Red Hat (located down the street) for a drink or bite to eat. Note that this is optional.</p> <p>Event Summary:</p> <p>12:30pm - 2:30pm Meal preparation &amp; Dining hall<br/>set-up<br/>2:30pm - 3:30pm Meal is served by volunteers to guests<br/>3:30pm - 4:30pm Clean-up</p> <p>About Saturdays Bread:</p> <p>Saturday’s/Sunday’s Bread is a program that serves free hot meals to people in need in Boston every Saturday and Sunday at the Church of St. John the Evangelist, 35 Bowdoin Street, Boston. Their mission is to provide healthy meals in a safe and inviting atmosphere, free from Society’s prejudices and judgments. This is an interfaith, interracial, interdenominational activity of people concerned with the hungry in the Boston area.</p> <p>Over the course of its 25 years, Saturday’s/Sunday’s Bread has served more than 300,000 guests. Directions</p> <p>Saturdays Bread is located at The Church of St. John the Evangelist is at 35 Bowdoin Street, Boston, between Cambridge Street and Derne Street behind the State House. The entrance to the dining hall is through the door to the right of the main church entrance. Go up the ramp and ring the bell marked \"Clayton Hall,\" not \"Church Business\" or \"Common Room.\" Please be patient; it sometimes is hard to hear the bell in the dining hall or kitchen.</p> <p>Parking: Parking is a challenge, so it's a good idea to carpool or to go by T if possible. The on-street parking is very scarce. The closest public parking is the 100 Cambridge Street Parking Garage, which you enter from Somerset Street, one block east of Bowdoin. Parking at the garage is $7.00 for the full day on weekends.</p> <p>There are a few other small parking lots nearby. The Boston Common Garage, a little further away, is $10 for the full day on weekends.</p> <p>To reach the 100 Cambridge Street Parking Garage: Coming from Storrow Drive and West, go one block past Bowdoin Street (and past the 100 Cambridge Street building). Turn right at the next light onto Somerset. Coming from Government Center and South/East, turn left at the end of Center Plaza, the large, curved building opposite Government Center. The garage is on the right in the first block. If the auto entrance door is down, please knock; the garage is open Saturdays and Sundays.</p> <p>Public Transportation: The closest T stop is the Government Center stop on the Green Line. From the subway exit, walk west on Cambridge Street two blocks and turn left on Bowdoin. The walk from the Park Street (Red/Green Line) station is a little longer, but a pleasant walk in good weather. Follow Park Street toward the State House, turn right on Beacon, then quickly left onto Bowdoin.</p> <p>We charge a $4 dollar fee that is used for SVB's Operating Costs. Meetup posting costs, website, other expenses.</p>",

      "description": "<p>This is a photo walk to capture some of the more unique architecture of Boston's inner city. The main goal for this meetup is to capture buildings in the most unique way possible, not so much straight-on, rather than at steep angles, with your fisheye lens or as a reflection in a show window. Staying until after dark will allow us to capture star trails in the city, which requires focusing on stars as well as some specialized post-processing, which I will explain.</p> <p>We will meet at the Custom House (the clock tower), see \"how to find us\" for exact coordinates (paste those into Google maps). From there, we will walk around to shoot at some five to six different locations, ending up at the very unique  Municipal Court Department building, a very cool building with sharp edge, perfect for star or cloud trails. From there, we can return or adjourn, your choice. I will send out or have with me a marching route as we get closer.</p> <p><br/>Weather forecast is pretty good, temperatures in the high 70s and dropping, cloud cover about 25%, making for good cloud streaks if you bring your ND filters or stay into the night. There will be no moon, making this perfect for star trails after dark. Sunset is at 8:20</p> <p><br/>Suggested equipment: fisheye, super-wide angle, lens baby, tilt-shift lenses tripod if you want to stay into dark, a remote and perhaps a pad to kneel down and shoot straight up (I use a ~8x10 patch of yoga mat that I carry with me at all times) - bless you if you have an articulating monitor.</p> <p><br/>Places that we will cover, other than the clock tower are: Leventhal Park, Boston City Hall and Government Center, Winthrop Square, Post Office Square, Liberty Square and the Court Department:</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/e/600_436563694.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Photos courtesy of Derrick Morin:</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/4/7/600_436337479.jpeghttp://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/4/e/600_436337486.jpeghttp://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/5/e/600_436337502.jpeghttp://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/6/5/600_436337509.jpeghttp://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/7/3/600_436337523.jpeg\" /></p>",

This also allows us to take turns getting snacks, etc., before the previews start.  It also allows for any unexpected, last minute changes at the theater.  Although fairly infrequent, having wiggle room to exchange tickets, etc. is VERY helpful.</p> <p><b>Please note, everyone is responsible for buying their own tickets.  And while it is possible to buy your ticket at the door, shows often sell out. I strongly advise you to buy your tickets in advance.  I will announce when tickets go on sale on Fandango. Please do NOT buy tickets until I have finalized the time.</b></p> <p>If you miss the group ahead of time, come find us after. We gather in the hallway outside of the theater we just saw the movie in, to discuss the film a bit, allow for restroom breaks and to get a head count of all those who would like to go out after for drinks and munchies.</p> <p><b>$$$$Managing the after event is much easier if everyone brings cash, so please plan ahead if you want to go out with the group after.  We will be splitting one bill for the group. No separate checks.$$$</b></p> <p><i><b>One more thing, please keep your rsvp's up to date so I can plan the after event and know who to look for. </b> <b>Thanks!</b></i></p> <p>Movie Details:</p> <p>Release date: July 1, 2015<br/>(3D/2D theaters and IMAX 3D)        <br/><b>Studio:</b> Paramount Pictures       </p> <p><b>Director:</b> Alan Taylor</p> <p><b>Screenwriters:</b> Patrick Lussier, Laeta Kalorgridis</p> <p><b>Starring:</b> Sandrine Holt, J.K.

The venue charges by hour and the number of people in a room. 12 people for 3 hours ends up being $16.25 (before taxes), 11 people is $16.36 (again before taxes), 10 people is $16.50, and so on a so forth. The only accept cash so if you bring $20 you should be all set.</p> <p><b>Food and Drinks</b></p> <p>DoReMi has vending machines with snacks and drinks. They also allow outside food and drinks (with the exception of alcohol) to be brought in. Please feel free to bring your own snacks and drinks to share with the group and we'll have our own mini potluck.</p> <p><b>Getting Here</b></p> <p>Please check the website below for public transportation options.

Or: \"do you know where the Meetup is?\" If they are with us, good. If they aren't, (if they think you are interesting also) they will ask you \"what is Meetup?\" and you have got a conversation going! There will be no lack of company &amp; that's a promise!! </p> <p>Gets packed after 10:30. <br/> \nLast time Meetup people were having so much fun we lost track of time and stayed for hours!</p> <p></i>You might as well be invited to a private home in a back yard, because everyone is so sociable and that is why this is always so popular. <br/> \n<i>Low key party atmosphere.</i> The low volume funky back round sound is perfect.

Let's return to our glory days for some school yard fun! So many relationships were formed while we were playing games-we made friends, scores were settled, and we figured out how to interact with the opposite sex. Well, some of us did :)</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/4/0/6/600_314090182.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Worried about being branded with the logo from the rubber ball? Well, don't...we use soft squishy balls…without a visible logo :) So, if you really hope to get a tattoo, you'll have to find another way.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/4/2/4/600_314090212.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Dodgeball Details:</b> Teams are chosen round robin style, so it doesn't matter if you ruled the schoolyard at one point. There won't be any awkward \"I hope I'm chosen before the kid in the full body cast\". The \"rules\" will be explained by the referee before playing starts. They aren't complex, and there won't be any instant replays for controversial calls.</p> <p>It's designed to be fun, playful, and casual. The only rule I can remember is not aiming for someone's head. Ladies, I can't guarantee that the guys are going to follow that one : ) Guys, this is still not the best way to get a woman's attention….</p> <p>All levels are welcome! We will be playing on a padded floor, wearing socks (<b>remember to bring socks!</b>). The arena is air conditioned and is smaller than a typical dodgeball court.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/4/1/a/600_314090202.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Dodgeball of Boston</b> is located at 1 Broadway in Arlington, MA. There is a small parking lot, emphasis on small, and free street parking available on the side streets. Public transportation is probably the easiest way to get there. It's about one mile from <b>Davis Sq Redline T </b>and <b>Alewife T Stations</b>.</p> <p><b>Cost: $10</b>. PLEASE try to pay with a $10 bill, or some combination that adds up to $10 ($5 bills, $1 bills, etc…), as change is hard to make. The cover goes to pay the rent for the space.</p> <p><b>After Dodgeball:</b> We will head for drinks/appetizers nearby at:</p> <p><b>Orleans Restaurant <br/>65 Holland Street <br/>Davis Square, Cambridge</b></p> <p>We always have a lot of fun there too, drinking, eating and singing karaoke, and it's a great way to enjoy Friday night!</p> <p>This will be a joint event with other meet up groups, please only RSVP in one group.</p> <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Please be sure to bring socks with you in order to play!</p> <p><b>--Carla &amp; Matt <br/>;-)</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/cXmt_iFLd58\" class=\"embedded\">https://youtu.be/cXmt_iFLd58</a></p>",

      "description": "<p>Let's step out of our comfort zone a bit and try something different. We will ride the T, photographing some of the more interesting stations and people along the way. That's right - we will be shooting people! No pretty landscapes on this shoot.</p> <p><b>The rules:</b></p> <p>1. No tripods</p> <p>2. Shots must be <i>on</i>, <i>in</i>, or <i>of</i> some part of the MBTA 'T' system.</p> <p><b>The cost:</b></p> <p>If you already have a T pass, you are all set.  Otherwise, check out the MBTA website for pricing: <a href=\"http://www.mbta.com/fares_and_passes/.\"><a href=\"http://www.mbta.com/fares_and_passes/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.mbta.com/fares_and_passes/</a></a>.  I recommend purchasing a 24 hour pass at a station kiosk for $12.</p> <p><b>Parking</b></p> <p>There is street and garage parking in the area.  Consider parking at the extremities of the T routes (Wonderland $5, Forrest Hills $6, Braintree $7, etc.). it's cheaper, and you can plan your shooting according to your route back to your car.</p> <p>Service Alert: Busses will replace Blue line service between Maverick and Orient Heights, so there's a delay for us North Shore folks  </p> <p>Travel light. You could do well with just a single lens in the 35-50 range (full frame), or 22-30 (crop). Of course, feel free to bring super wide to long tele if you feel like lugging all that gear around. Fast apertures are needed - f2.8 or better. A 50mm f1.8 or f1.4 would be ideal. Bring less gear and use smaller lenses to help remain inconspicuous while shooting people.</p> <p>Some challenges:</p> <p><b>Motion blur:</b> even slow moving trains and people can be blurred with shutter speeds around 1/8.</p> <p><b>Candid moments:</b> Be patient and inconspicuous. Wait for expressions and interactions. Shoot from the hip - don't be obvious.</p> <p><b>Ghosting: </b>Yes, this can be done without a tripod!</p> <p>I will provide some tips for slow shutter shooting before we start.  I am not limiting the group number, so we should spread out in small groups.  Some stations I expect to visit include: Park Street, Charles MGH, Harvard Square, Downtown Crossing, and South Station - certainly more.</p> <p>The photos below are from a project from a few years ago - I couldn't find the color images, but B/W works too!</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/f/7/600_439277655.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/f/b/600_439277659.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/5/0/7/600_439277671.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/5/0/c/600_439277676.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/5/0/d/600_439277677.jpeg\" /></p>",

Music is played for Standard and Smooth styles such as waltz, foxtrot, and tango as well as Latin and Rhythm styles including salsa, rumba, cha-cha, and the like. At Star Dance School Socials an optional 30 minute group dance lesson kicks off the evening as well!</p> <p>What on earth should I wear?!<br/>Smart-casual to elegant attire is encouraged, but most importantly wear clothing you can move around in comfortably. If you do not have ballroom shoes often a light weight dress shoe will do the trick. *Note: Please avoid sneakers or metal spike-heel shoes as they can damage our floor. Thank you for your understanding!*</p> <p>Do I need a partner?<br/>Partners are welcome, but not required to enjoy a night out on the town with us! Social dancing is a fantastic way to make new friends and we encourage dancers to rotate partners in order to meet new people.</p> <p>Do I need prior dance experience?<br/>Whether it is your first time dancing or you have years of ballroom under your belt, all levels are welcome to attend our socials!</p>",

Check this out…</p> <p><br/>Bill Twyford, recently joined best-selling author and marketing expert, Dan Kennedy, along with a select group of the world’s leading experts to co-write the book titled, Stand Apart: Stand Out Strategies from Today’s Leading Entrepreneurs and Professionals to Help You Achieve Health, Wealth, &amp; Success. The book was released on January 16, 2014.</p> <p>Then 8 days later earlier this year, Dwan Bent-Twyford was a featured author with Steve Forbes (yes, that Steve Forbes pictured above with our Speakers) and other experts in SuccessOnomics. The intriguing part of success is that it means such different things to different people. However, just as success encompasses achievement, SuccessOnomics™ implies the achieving of goals through fiscal competence.</p> <p>I will have more details coming soon but our main meeting in the evening was NOT enough! I have talked them into holding a Foreclosure Summit for 2 FULL days the following Saturday AND Sunday jammed packed with information! They will cover how to buy notes, how to wholesale, short sale, how their homeowner systems work, how they find foreclosures, what paperwork they use, how the bankruptcy system works, how to jump-start your foreclosure investing business, and more.</p> <p>How much more????</p> <p>OK, here it is:</p> <p>• Notes: Performing and Non-Performing</p> <p>• Short SalesWholesalesNLP (Sales Talk)</p> <p>• The DNA of Real Estate Investing</p> <p>• The Bankruptcy Short SaleScripts/ </p> <p>• Talking to Homeowners and Banks</p> <p>• Short Sales Done For You</p> <p>• Homeowner Options</p> <p>• Buying REO’sBulk Portfolio Buying</p> <p>• Buying properties from Bankruptcy Trustees and Receivers</p> <p>• Door Knocking</p> <p>• Active Marketing verses Passive Marketing</p> <p>• Getting around Seasoning and Transactional Funding</p> <p>Business Planning</p> <p>The Two Day Foreclosure Summit with Bill and Dawn Twyford is only $69 for non members and only $49 for Boston REIA Premium members! PLUS something we don’t do very often… Bring a spouse, partner, or family member for FREE!</p> <p>Get your tickets:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/foreclosure-summit-weekend-training-with-dwan-and-bill-twyford-tickets-17415373852?aff=ebsavedevents\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.eventbrite.com/e/foreclosure-summit-weekend-training-with-dwan-and-bill-twyford-tickets-17415373852?aff=ebsavedevents</a></p>",

      "description": "<p>Lets explore one of Boston's Inner Harbor Islands - Georges Island. The 39 acre island is comprised of two drumlins. Originally used for agriculture for 200 years until in 1825 the US Government acquired it for coastal defense. Over the next 20yrs Fort Warren was constructed. Upon completion, the forts defensive design was virtually obsolete. The fort served as a training ground, patrol point, and Civil War prison. After 100yrs of Military use, the fort was decommissioned in 1947 and acquired by the Metropolitan District Commission for the historic preservation and recreation in 1958.</p> <p>Lets see if we can find \"the Lady in Black\" the ghost of a Confederate prisoner's wife who is said to have been sentenced to death for aiding in an escape after disguising herself as a male soldier, and hanged in a black robe which was the best he soldiers could do to accommodate her last request of being executed in female clothing. The myth brought attention  to the need for preservation and protection of Fort Warren and inclusion in Mass State Parks and eventually National Park System.</p> <p>What to bring: flashlight/flash for lighting the dark corridors and creating our own images of where the Lady in Black resides, tripod, various lenses.</p> <p>Purchase tickets on-line for $17.00 at <a href=\"https://ticketing.bostonharborcruises.com\"><a href=\"https://ticketing.bostonharborcruises.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://ticketing.bostonharborcruises.com</a></a> or through the Boston Harbor Cruises website.

Come join us for a day exploring Rhode Island's most beautiful village and yachting center.</p> <p>We'll meet in the Porter Square parking lot by Panera to meet up and carpool. Please be prepared to chip in for gas with your car owner (or ZipCar costs). If different cars prefer to meet in different places, we could potentially meet in other places.  We'll make the 1.5 hour trek to Newport across, spend the day with the 5-mansion tour package, have a picnic lunch, and should be back by 5pm.</p> <p>Come with your lunch packed! We can grab additional food as well, but since the transport and tickets will probably add up, this is a way to save a bit of money.</p> <p><img src=\"http://img1.coastalliving.timeinc.net/sites/default/files/image/Marketing/images/0907/newport/newportmansion_l.jpg\" /></p> <p>Tickets are $32.99 and can be purchased at the mansions.

If you RSVP, I'll be waiting to hear from you, so please show up, or let me know if circumstances change! If you ditch us without warning a few times, we'll have to remove you from the group.

This cause for the past several years has ranged from serving injured veterans upon their return home from overseas, aiding families of those veterans with financial assistance, providing housing modifications and so forth. Through organizations like the Semper Fi Fund and Veterans Advocacy Services, we like to proudly say we support those who preserve our freedom. This year will be our biggest effort yet. 40 Pin Up style models will be posing for photographers at this year's Rockabilly-style cookout benefitting Veterans Advocacy Services. They will be posing on motorcycles, hot rods as well as in the serene back drop of the pond and gazebo area of the Maynard Rod and Gun Club. Come and join us on a day that is family friendly, full of fun and patriotism as we collaborate . Hair + make up is provided for Pin Up Models. Information for this event is as follows:</p> <p>A motorcycle bike run, rockabilly-style cook out and family - friendly summer bash with honored guest speakers and awards for tattoos and motorcycles.

      "description": "<p>This is the new, regular meetup on Sundays at noon at Brooklyn Boulders in Somerville. Look for the dark-haired guy with glasses and yellow Katana climbing shoes who keeps falling off the bouldering wall. I'll have my stuff on the first table/bench thing by the entrance. I primarily boulder, but hopefully we'll get a good variety of climbing interests coming so that everyone can follow their climbing passion!</p> <p>(Credit to Francesco Cardiello for the information below):<br/>BKBS is the gorgeous, new, state-of-the-art climbing gym most convenient to those in the Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville area. Although pricier, it features 60+ feet toproping and lead climbing, a massive 22 x 140 foot bouldering wall (and there's still another upstairs), yoga &amp; fitness classes, a sauna, awesome water fountains that fill your water bottle, a retail store, lounge area, weight room, and a soon to open cafe! There's even a collaborative work space where you can study, work, and climb!<br/>If you are looking for a partner or just want to get your climb on join us on Wednesdays for a fun time.</p> <p>FAQ:</p> <p>How do I get there? BKBS is conveniently located within a 10 minute walk of the Porter Square station. Walk down Somerville Avenue and turn right on Properzi way and head all the way down. It is also very bike accessible. If you drive, you can find the lot at 30 Dane St. It is located next to Artisans Asylum.</p> <p>Why should I do this meetup? Since BKBS is such a new community (opened in late July 2013) few people have developed regular climbing partners to train and climb with. This is a great opportunity to meet other climbers interested in BKBS. Climbing is an inherently social sport - to top rope and do lead, you need to meet people who are dedicated to climbing. The Wednesday meetup assures you'll meet a partner to regularly climb with. We are looking to expand to other nights in the future.</p> <p>What if I haven't climbed before? First off, don't be intimidated. Everyone started somewhere. If you have never belayed before, please make sure to take the Learn the Ropes class. More info can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.bkbsomerville.com/Classes/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.bkbsomerville.com/Classes/</a>. If you have a working knowledge of how to belay, you will need to be belay certified before using the walls. Please flag down a BKBS employee and let them know you need to take a belay test. To pass such a test you will need to display how to tie a double figure eight knot with a fisherman's backup, safely belay a climber up a wall, catch them on a fall, and lower them to the ground safely.</p> <p>What equipment do I need? You will need at the bare minimum a harness and climbing shoes. Rentals are available. Grigri devices are provided at every station.</p> <p>What if I can come, but at a different time? Just let everyone know you want to climb at a different time and use the community to find a partner for those dates / times.</p> <p>These are the climbing rates:</p> <p>ADMISSION (Full day use, you can leave and come back!): Day Pass - $22 (Students $18)<br/>10 Pack - $200 (Students $169)</p> <p>RENTALS: Shoes - $5<br/>Harness - $5<br/>Chalk Bag - $2<br/>Full Gear Kit - $11</p>",

      "description": "<p>On June 27, the Humanist Hub’s board of directors, staff and selected volunteer leaders held the first-ever Hub Strategic Planning Retreat; a key topic was how we, as a community, should respond to Humanism’s “identity crisis.” With a larger nonreligious population than ever comes greater opportunity for communities and organizations to represent the interests of the freethinking population. But the challenge of determining who exactly we are, and what an organization for us should do or be, is also increasingly confusing and complicated.</p> <p>How do we strike the right balance between secular and humanist? Between being a safe space for atheists, or agnostics, or our religious allies? How political should we be? How much should we emphasize ritual? How do we effectively welcome people from a huge range of different backgrounds...and personality styles? In other words, how do we decide when to connect, when to act, and when to evolve-- not to mention, when to criticize religious beliefs or stand up for the rights of the nonreligious? </p> <p>Never waste a crisis, Rahm Emanuel said early in the Obama administration. And after 15 years as an active humanist, Greg believes this is the time to move toward greater clarity...or at least, to admit our ambivalence! Join us for a talk, discussion, breakout groups, food, and hanging out. </p> <p>PS: Notes from the strategic planning retreat will be shared in the coming weeks, but only with formal Hub members. You can join any time, it only takes a few minutes and a major financial contribution is not required (visit humanist hub.org to sign up). </p> <p>PPS: Thank you for all the requests to hear Greg’s talks online. Though we haven’t made the recordings available yet, they will all be incorporated into his next book, and we’ll also keep you posted when we do post them!</p>",

      "description": "<p>It's that time again! Time for our annual summer cookout and auction. Every year this is one of our more enjoyable meetings. Great fellowship, good food and a chance to pick up anything from pots to trees to books to tools and so on, and at very reasonable prices!! In past years some excellent bonsai and pre bonsai stock were picked up by many members at excellent prices. As always, the club supplies the dogs and drinks while members are encouraged to bring finger foods for all to enjoy. Members are also encouraged to bring bonsai related or not items for the auction. We'll find a new home for them. This is one of our main ways of fund raising for workshops and hall rental costs. So.please plan on attending and support our club.</p> <p>                                                                Thank you</p> <p>                                                                 Charlie</p> <p>\n\n\nA final reminder: In August we will be traveling to New England Bonsai for their Summer sell down sale. September: BYOT workshop and in October we'll have Wayne Jope from Riverbend Gardens do a workshop for us.</p>",

I understand that parking in Cambridge on Sundays is unrestricted.</p> <p>Following this we'll head to join the follow up Social event at the Sinclair (or rain location), details follow.</i></p> <p>For the 5th time, at this popular &amp; rare incredible gem of a Museum meetup location we meet just inside the main entrance &amp; head (this time) strait into the main Surrealist gallery. The first art you will see to your left is Detroit Queen. Then we loop around back to the last gallery in that area containing some great masterpieces of the 19th century.</p> <p>Hosts will be waiting there briefly so we can regroup at 3:20 PM.<i> Regroup area is the end of the loop on the first floor just after the 19th century masterpieces. If you are late meet us there.</i> DO NOT FORGET THERE IS A LOT MORE TO SEE so don't linger. </p> <p>Then we head upstairs  to the 2nd floor (we won't visit the other floors above) -- go to the elevators or take the stairs there where we'll head down the hall where the painting of the wounded Amazon is. <i>(To get to that, take a left from the elevators then left again).</i> Forging ahead, we'll check out the mini Bernini statuettes, then the room of the Madonnas and their babies. By now you'll know who is in the Meetup so try and stick with the group. But host Nilesh or Duncan should be your main guides to not losing the group.</p> <p><i>NOTE-- I will not linger at some of the galleries but pass through because there will be MUCH MORE to see after this.</i>  <i>So GO! stay with the company. This is a meetup enjoy the company; if you want to come back later to linger at your fav places do that then.</i> <br/> \nIf you do lose us or get tired, look for others in the meetup at the cafeteria back on the first floor, where we gather again and leave by 4:45 to go to The Sinclair patio . The Sinclair event is separately posted also with Social Fun.</p> <p><i>ADMISSION free for Cambridge residents with a drivers license and Cambridge library card. Otherwise it's $15. Backpacks not allowed. You can store them in lockers across from the admissions area, alternately there is another locker area down one floor from there.</i> </b></p>",

      "description": "<p>   Here's the link to the online location:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gratefulness.org/labyrinth/index.htm\"><a href=\"http://www.gratefulness.org/labyrinth/index.htm\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.gratefulness.org/labyrinth/index.htm</a></a></p> <p>Hope you enjoy it as much as I have!</p> <p>Remember that in the labyrinth the 3D rules relax. Time, space, extraneous noise and interruption are altered as we move toward center. This creates a personal, sacred space, a high frequency bubble of awareness that allows your stress to be transformed by the laws of resonance.</p> <p>   This interactive model gives you multiple options. You  may use your mouse to move the cursor or you may choose to allow the program to do that for you. Either way, you may follow the mouse with your eyes or a finger. Close or cover one eye... and follow with the other:  you access &amp; enhance the opposite side of your brain. Do the same with the other, then perhaps, both. If you are using your finger to follow the cursor along the path use one finger the first time... use the same finger on the other hand next time. Again, this accesses different parts of your brain and brings clearing &amp; energy to that part that is being stimulated. This translates into clearer neurological pathways, clearer energy meridians in your body and opportunities for greater insight, stronger connections to your own intuition and spirit.</p> <p>  Before your 'walk, you could smudge, light a candle, say a prayer, call in the Four Directions, invite your angels or guides to be present with you on the path.... Set your intention if you wish, ask your guidance to show you what you need to know, or what is standing in your way. You might ask  to understand and  release an illusion that is keeping you from a relationship or abundance in your life.</p> <p>   As you return from center, you may invite understanding, knowing, peace to fill your awareness. </p> <p>   Take time for yourself after your 'walk'. Have some water handy. This kind of vibrational/energy work allows the body to transmute and release long held concepts, belief forms, illusions from their resting place in cellular memory to be transformed into energy that supports you instead of weighing you down. Just as if you did yoga or had a massage, your body may release and clear pure water will support the process.</p> <p>   Even in an interactive online labyrinth... you are never alone... If we all walk at 3 on the 2nd Sunday... we walk together. And always, even when it seems we are walking alone, or not...  our guides &amp; angels are there.</p> <p>   Will be posting a couple of holiday events... hope to see you in 3D soon. Peace, Deb</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",

We want to warmly extend an invitation to Deaf people or others fluent/skilled in the language (CODAs for example) to join our group.</p> <p>This is an easy-going, casual, ASL get-together to meet people who enjoy American Sign Language, who want to brush up on their signing skills, and want to learn more ASL by using it as often as possible.</p> <p>We strive to have a good time and communicate without using voices. If we need to, we draw or write what we don't know how to sign, and if lots of folks show up, we split up into small groups and mix and mingle, so we can actually see one another clearly, face-to-face and get a good conversation going.</p> <p>Don't be afraid or shy if you're not \"perfect\" at ASL, because being \"perfect\" is not the point of this group. No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.</p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again. This isn't an ASL class, since none of us are certified ASL teachers, so there's really <i>no</i> pressure or expectation--other than that we all use ASL to communicate. We all learn from one another!</p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language</i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs</i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!</p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged</i></b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating. We have lots of resources that we can suggest for learning ASL from a qualified teacher or authentic source, such as books, online classes, and local classes at various locations near Boston.</p> <p>If you can, \"officially\" RSVP, even if the RSVP is \"No,\" so that we know who is definitely going to come.</p> <p>It will be great to see folks!</p> <p>Erika and Jack</p>",

On average, 80% of those who attend end up with at least one or two mutual matches.</p> <p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</b></p> <p><b>PAYMENT POLICY:<br/>$24 (MUST register with code ATWYS- codes can not be applied after registration)</b></p> <p><b>REGISTER AND PAY HERE: </b></p> <p><a href=\"https://2015bostonatwysspeeddating.eventbrite.com\"><a href=\"https://2015bostonatwysspeeddating.eventbrite.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://2015bostonatwysspeeddating.eventbrite.com</a></a></p> <p><b>(SEE MORE FAQ's BELOW)</b></p> <p><i><b>ABSOLUTELY NO REFUNDS FOR LAST MINUTE/DAY OF CANCELLATIONS. NO EXCEPTIONS.</b></i></p> <p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</b></p> <p><br/><b>FAST FACTS - PLEASE READ:</b></p> <p>*We can not accept payment at the door for these events. All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.</p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.</p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.</p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples/24 people. (See reason below)</p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*</p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.</p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.</p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.</p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.</p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.</p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:</b></p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?</p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.</p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.  Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.</p> <p><br/><b>FAQ'S</b></p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?</b></p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.</p> <p><b>What should I wear?</b></p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.</p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?</b></p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.</p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?</b></p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.</p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?</b></p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http://andthatswhyyouresingle.com/\">main events website</a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.</p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?</b></p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations.

      "description": "<p>     This is an ongoing weekly (donation only) class for anyone, offering experiential practice in meditation, along with an opportunity to be among others interested in deepening spiritutual practices.  The class provides you with a felt sense of your own divinity; your Higher Self. The meditation, based on Kriya practices,  is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body/mind/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening. Bringing the flow of light into the body/mind/heart means we more consciously embody our Light Being, so we are more present, happy, forgiving, peaceful and joyful while in the world.<br/>   After the guided portion we spend time in peaceful silence.  Whether you are an experienced meditator or a beginner, you will love the sweetness and powerful energies of this group. At the end of the class we make time for questions or sharing.  Group meditation is powerful, and it's refreshing to be among fellow travelers!<br/>   Judy also teaches the Sound and Light meditation; a way for you to draw your senses inward to open your spiritual eye and to hear the sounds of your chakras. <br/>   This practice is non-denominational, appropriate for anyone. <br/>   Held in a lovely healing space, just walking in will bring you instant peace.  All are welcome.<br/>    You may also want to check out my other Meetup, for a variety of spiritual programs:  <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Evolving-Beings/\"><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Evolving-Beings\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Evolving-Beings</a></a>/</p>",

No sneakers or athletic wear, please.</p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?</b></p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.</p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?</b></p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.</p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?</b></p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http://andthatswhyyouresingle.com/\">main events website</a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.</p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?</b></p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.</p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?</b></p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.</p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?</b></p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.</i></p> <p><b>PLEASE</b> <b>REMEMBER:</b><br/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http://www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.</a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup. Therefore the number of RSVPs reflected here are NOT the total number of men or women registered.</i></p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.</b></i></p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups. Please note that many people opt NOT to RSVP through Meetup for privacy reasons.</i></b></p>",

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.</p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.</p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.</p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples/24 people. (See reason below)</p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*</p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.</p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?</p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.</p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.  Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.</p> <p><br/><b>FAQ'S</b></p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people.

      "description": "<p><b>House of Bamboo</b></p> <p>Directed by Samuel Fuller. With Robert Ryan, Robert Stack, Shirley Yamaguchi<br/>US 1955, 35mm, color, 103 min</p> <p>Assigned to remake Fox's 1948 crime filmThe Street With No Name, Fuller transported the story of underworld racketeers to postwar Tokyo and Yokohama and joyfully seized the challenge of filming one of the first major Hollywood productions shot on location in US-occupied Japan. House of Bamboo is a brisk and violently beautiful tale of love and betrayal made vivid by bold expressions of Fuller's signature graphic style (an assassination in an ofuro tub, a gunfight on a rooftop amusement park) and extraordinary use of iconic Japanese locations, from Mount Fuji to gaudy pachinko parlors. The twin poles of the taut drama are Robert Ryan and Robert Stack as competing versions of steely and scarred masculinity, each with a secret vulnerability flickering beneath their shells of brooding bitterness that hint at a dark past. Fuller adds a subversive element by making House of Bamboo a kind of love story between men, with the gorgeous Shirley Yamaguchi caught somewhere in between.</p> <p>As this is a work night, there will not be a Meetup after the film for discussion.  This film is part of HFA's Sam Fuller retrospective.  We will post several of his films, with many opportunities for After-Film Discussion.</p> <p>See you at the movies,</p> <p>John</p>",

      "description": "<p>NUTSHELL - every week day, 12:15ish until 1:45ish, Cumnock Turf Fields at Harvard Stadium, games of 4v4 up to 10v10 or larger depending on who shows, bring a white shirt and a dark/colored shirt (but not a gray one), almost never canceled, read below for more details before asking questions that are answered here, and read the comments for today's meetup to see if there is anything important about today.</p> <p><a href=\"http://goo.gl/I0tPQQ\"><a href=\"http://goo.gl/I0tPQQ\" class=\"linkified\">http://goo.gl/I0tPQQ</a></a></p> <p>GETTING THERE BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT - Harvard Square is the closest T stop (red line).  Check Google Maps or other to find fastest way there from wherever you are.</p> <p>GETTING THERE BY RIDE SHARE - a lot of players in this meetup come by car and are nice enough to offer rides to others. Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.</p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium.  They will patrol for cars parked illegally.</p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.</p> <p>ATTIRE - Bring a *white* shirt and a dark/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams.  DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine.  Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.</p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better.  That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled.  Check here right before heading over.</p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes.  Most people playing do this for fun and/or exercise in the middle of the day.  Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:</p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely return to the office/class afterward.</p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.</p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball. </p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony/legal matter.</p> <p>WHAT ELSE - All skill levels welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest updates for today's meetup.</p>",

This class has two parts: Day 1 (7/13/2015): A 4 hour instructional class where all participants will build and program an autonomous robot from our Sumo Bot kit. Everyone will leave with a basic understanding of robotics and a working autonomous robot on which they can continue to experiment and learn. Day 2 (Date TBD): We will hold a Sumo Bot competition where class participants will compete for fun and bragging rights. This class will be an introduction to autonomous robotics where participants will build and program an autonomous robot. After the class, everyone is encouraged to bring their robots home and make improvements (within the Sumo bot rules). There will be a two week period to change your robot and make it the best Sumo Bot you can make before the competition. There are no programming, electrical or mechanical pre-requisites to take this course. You will experience the basics of:</p> <p>Programming using Arduino<br/>Electronic sensors (range finder and infrared detector)<br/>3d printing<br/>Electrical wiring and trouble shooting<br/>Autonomous robotic algorithms</p> <p><br/>The price of this class includes a complete robotic kit which allows you to build a working mini Sumo Bot that complies with the Unified Mini Sumo Bot rules. The robot will be very basic and the participants are encouraged to make electrical, mechanical and software upgrades. An open hack-night will be held between the class and the competition to help those who have problems and questions. Robotic experts will be on hand to help troubleshoot and answer questions.</p> <p>Members of Lowell Makes may attend this class for $60.</p>",

I'll be hosting this event every Monday night during the summer. </p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/6/9/5/600_439029877.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>More information:</b></p> <p><i>Back by popular demand, MetaMovements Dance Company, the Blackstone Community Center, and several other supporting sponsors set out for the 5th consecutive year to launch Salsa In The Park, a series of outdoor salsa dance and youth programs in collaboration with the cities of Boston and Cambridge.</i> </p> <p>Created to decrease crime in the area, provide dozens of summer jobs for high school students, and to improve the overall livelihood of the community, Salsa In The Park offers a stimulating cultural and learning experience for everyone to enjoy in a safe and friendly outdoor environment. </p> <p><i>Last summer, Salsa In The Park attracted over 500 people every clear Monday night to the Blackstone Center, including children of all ages, families, adults, and senior citizens, not to mention Boston’s leading Salsa dancers, creating an empowering sense of community and positive, healthy energy.</i></p>",

Some cause infections, and these bacterial pathogens are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, threatening our ability to treat disease. Other bacteria are beneficial and essential for human health. They populate almost every surface on our body, and many within. Our bodies contain more bacterial cells than human cells. Bacteria are also important in the production of many foods (e.g., yogurt and cheese) and can help decompose all types of organic matter – for example, decomposing dead plants in forests.<br/>Despite being single-celled organisms, bacteria are remarkably complex. They are capable of communicating with each other. They can transfer genes to other bacteria, conferring new traits onto their neighbors. The rampant spread of antibiotic resistances in bacterial populations is due to this “sharing,” or transfer of genes from one organism to another. The ways in which bacteria acquire new genes, including those of antibiotic resistance, are topics of fervent study in microbiology research. Among many other important problems, Dr. Alan Grossman and his lab at MIT are interested in understanding: how bacteria talk to each other; how they transfer genes from one organism to another (sex); and how they prevent or minimize transfer of genes (contraception).</p> <p><b>Science by the Pint</b> is sponsored by an organization of Harvard graduate students called Science in the News.  In between their sleepless hours of hard work at Harvard Med School, they bring cutting edge scientific research to the public in a fun and informal format. </p> <p><br/><b>The Burren</b> is located on Elm Street right in the heart of Davis Square, just a short walk from the Red Line stop.  If you prefer to drive, there are metered spots on the street and in nearby municipal lots (see link below).  Meters are active until 8:00 PM, and metered spots are free thereafter. Municipal lot meters are good for three hours, and street spots are good for two.</p> <p>Links:</p> <p><a href=\"https://biology.mit.edu/people/alan_grossman\">Grossman Lab website</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SITNBoston\">SITN Facebook Page</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/science-by-the-pint/#june9\">SITN: Science by the Pint</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.burren.com/\">The Burren</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.somervillema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Davis%20Square%20Parking%20Map.pdf\">Davis Square Parking</a></p>",

Although at first it seemed to him a farfetched proposition, his career as a novelist would soon be launched. he flew off to Athens to write in seclusion, returning to Paris months later with a full-length manuscript in his arm bearing the title <i>L'agneau carnivore </i>(<i>The Carnivorous Lamb</i>). It won the Prix Hermès for the best first novel of 1975--ironically, the year of Franco's death.</p> <p>Taken from the Introduction.</p>",

Plus Mondays are ladies night: discounted admission. If you'd like to lead climb, don't forget to bring your rope :)</p> <p>*** If you are new to MetroRock Gym and/or climbing, please see the FAQ below. ***</p> <p>Meet at the picnic tables near bouldering area (the one furthest from the cubbies if available) from 7 - 7:10 PM.  (NOTE: In the rare case the Event Host doesn't arrive within this time window, assume major traffic jam or other catastrophy, ask others nearby to find the group, make introductions, and go climb).  If arriving later, just come find us on the walls.  Hopefully you can recognize us, the event Host(s) (see RSVP list) from our profile pictures, and/or check the small Whiteboard near the bathrooms and water fountain, for a description of what we're wearing that day.</p> <p>Full-access Day Pass:  $22.  Students, Military or Bouldering-Only Pass:  $18.  Mondays are Ladies Night:  Women's Pass $14 after 3 PM &amp; also special class pricing.</p> <p>For membership, gear rentals, and other programs and pricing available, or for directions, check the gym website:  <a href=\"http://www.metrorock.com/\"><a href=\"http://www.metrorock.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.metrorock.com/</a></a></p> <p><b>Frequently Asked Questions for Newbies:</b></p> <p><i><b>Q)</b> How do I get to the gym?</i></p> <p><b>A)</b> See website for directions: <a href=\"http://www.metrorock.com/\"><a href=\"http://www.metrorock.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.metrorock.com/</a></a> If you're driving here for the first time, it can be tricky to find MetroRock Everett, especially in the dark! Use a GPS if possible. MetroRock is in a building opposite Boston Coach.   If you don't have a vehicle, the gym offers a shuttle service from nearby Wellington T Station; call the gym for schedule details.</p> <p><i><b>Q)</b> I've never climbed at MetroRock Gym before, what do I need to do?</i></p> <p><b>A)</b> You'll need to take and pass a belay test for rope climbing. There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear (harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.</p>",

      "description": "<p>For July we're reading Stitches: A Memoir.  Sounds interesting. Stray Toasters turned out to be a bit harder to find/pricier than I'd thought, and I don't feel like I can ask the group to shell out ~$50 for the book or fight for the ~3 copies at the library. You should all totally read it though! With no deadline, 3 copies is plenty to go around!</p> <p>Anyway, I'm really excited for Stitches too.</p> <p><br/><b>The time is 7:00</b>, until further notice, rather than 6:30; unless it causes problems we're keeping the new time<br/><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/8/b/600_439115211.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>The Bumf:</b></p> <p>David Small, a best-selling and highly regarded children's book illustrator, comes forward with this unflinching graphic memoir. Remarkable and intensely dramatic, Stitches tells the story of a fourteen-year-old boy who awakes one day from a supposedly harmless operation to discover that he has been transformed into a virtual mute―a vocal cord removed, his throat slashed and stitched together like a bloody boot. From horror to hope, Small proceeds to graphically portray an almost unbelievable descent into adolescent hell and the difficult road to physical, emotional, and artistic recovery.<b><br/></b></p> <p><b>If you plan on coming,</b> once you've read the book please post one discussion question in the comments for this event. I'll bring a list of them with me, and as usual we'll have them there to draw from when we're looking for stuff to talk about. I won't turn you away if you don't, but let's make running these things a group effort!<b><br/></b></p> <p><b>For those who haven't been to the Comic Book Club before</b>, it's pretty simple - we sit around, order some food and some drink, and we probe deep into the merits and meanings of our chosen book or books. I also bring along a list of questions (written by you!) to give the discussion a bit of structure - but don't worry - it's pretty casual!</p> <p><b>The venue is the Friendly Toast</b>, which is a very casual kinda place with plenty of room where we can easily be heard. Please note though, that it's best to bring cash - although supposedly their card minimum has been relaxed - perhaps even obliterated!</p>",

It was founded just after WWII as part of a Zen Buddhist practice. Today, while the martial art has been separated from the religion, the practice of Shorinji Kempo remains true to it's Zen Buddhist roots, with philosophy and meditation still integral to the study in the dojo of hard (punches, kicks and blocks) and soft techniques (releases, joint locks and throws).</p>",

We usually have a wide range of abilities attend.</p> <p>One of our semi-monthly bowls (the second and fourth Mondays of the month) - we'll be getting together at 7:30 at the Woburn Bowladrome in downtown Woburn (<a href=\"http://woburnbowl.com/index.htm\" class=\"linkified\">http://woburnbowl.com/index.htm</a>).</p> <p>The Woburn Bowladrome is located at 32 Montvale Avenue. They are just up the hill from Main Street and Route 38. You can get to the bowladrome from Route 93 by taking the Montvale Ave exit (Exit 36) or from Routes 128/95 from the Winn Street exit (exit 34). The bowladrome is near MBTA Bus 134 from Wellington Station. See below for more detailed directions/info. Parking is available in a large municipal lot behind the bowladrome and there's a back entrance to it from the lot. (The lot is the best place to park - there's little street parking nearby).</p> <p><b>VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: Parking can be difficult! Please allow an extra 15 minutes to park, as you may need to wait for a space.</b></p> <p><br/><b>RSVP:</b></p> <p>By 5:30, day of event. If you forget to RSVP, you can still come (and should!) - I can *almost* guarantee you'll get to bowl (so far they've always had extra lanes available when we've been going, but...?)</p> <p><br/><b>MEETING PLACE:</b></p> <p>By 7:30 - Inside the Woburn Bowladrome. Look for us by the counter in the middle, between the two sets of lanes.</p> <p><br/><b>COSTS:</b></p> <p>To be split among the group: The bowladrome charges $3.00 for shoe rental and $24 per hour ($12 per 1/2 hour) for bowling, with a $12 minimum (pricing is per lane). We've been averaging around $9-$11 per player lately, including shoes.</p> <p>I am not currently asking for an event fee to cover Meetup's charges, but donations are welcome (max $1 a month). :) (I may take another look at this after the group's been running 6 months.)</p> <p><br/><b>DIRECTIONS:</b></p> <p>If you're unfamiliar with downtown Woburn, I <i><b>strongly</b></i> recommend you print out a map of Woburn center before setting off, especially if you're following the directions from Route 128/95 North below.

      "description": "<p>This summer series of Irish set dancing classes is for beginners who want to learn the basic movements of set dancing while getting a feeling of accomplishment by dancing whole sets through from beginning to end each night. These are good refresher classes for fairly-new dancers, as well, or \"improvers\" who want to get more familiar with the various sets. </p> <p>We welcome more experienced dancers to join in the classes, as well, but the focus is on teaching beginners; in fact, it really helps the new dancers enjoy the classes more when they have a partner who knows the steps already. We all love sharing what we know and there is great satisfaction in helping newbies learn set dancing.</p> <p>We teach basic footwork and movements to specific sets during the 8 weeks of classes. We teach one set per night, figure by figure, then dance the whole set at the end of the night. By the end of the series of classes, the new dancer should have enough experience and confidence to join in any set dancing group and start to really enjoy the social and physical benefits of Irish set dancing. </p> <p>No partner is needed. Leather-soled shoes are recommended, or shoes that don't stick (most sneakers will stick), as set dancing has a lot of gliding movements. Wear comfortable clothes (think cotton t-shirts and loose pants).</p> <p>The cost is $8.00 per class* - pay as you go - no need to sign up for the whole series. [*$7 per class for Harrington's regular set dancers] </p> <p>Frank and Eileen have been enthusiastically teaching beginner summer classes for several years and will continue to teach the classes, but we also have special guest teachers this summer. </p>",

      "description": "<p>(Please note: many of the friends who attend regularly are not Meetup members, so there are always more people attending that it says on the Meetup site.)</p> <p>About This Meditation Meetup</p> <p>We sit in silence for around 45 minutes, followed by discussion for around 30 minutes or so. The silent sitting is interspersed with some meditation instruction, perhaps a brief reading, a little simple inquiry, exploration or movement. Sitting posture is relaxed, either on a meditation cushion or a bench. It's not a rigid practice- move whenever you need to!</p> <p>We meet every Monday night, 7:30 pm at the Cambridge Friends Meeting House. The Friends Meeting House is located at 5 Longfellow Park, Cambridge, MA 02138 You can find a very good map here: &lt;a href=\"http://www.fmcquaker.org/FMC-Map_2006.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p><a href=\"http://fmcquaker.org/about-friends-meeting-at-cambridge/directions/\" class=\"linkified\">http://fmcquaker.org/about-friends-meeting-at-cambridge/directions/</a></p> <p>Parking is available after 6:00 in the loop off of Brattle St. that leads to the Friend's House, and there is a small lot in back of the Friend's House for those with limited mobility. After that, parking is a little tricky in Cambridge (lots of \"resident only\" signs), but you will find available parking on Mount Auburn St. near Friend's House and on Brattle St. as you head away from Harvard Square.</p> <p>Coming by the T is a great option, with the Friend's House being a lovely 15 minute walk out of Harvard Square.</p> <p>If you find you are running late, come anyway! The format is very relaxed and open— anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!</p> <p> </p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group</p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.</p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions— for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti). </p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.</p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.</p> <p> </p>",

      "description": "<p>NUTSHELL - every week day, 12:15ish until 1:45ish, Cumnock Turf Fields at Harvard Stadium, games of 4v4 up to 10v10 or larger depending on who shows, bring a white shirt and a dark/colored shirt (but not a gray one), almost never canceled, read below for more details before asking questions that are answered here, and read the comments for today's meetup to see if there is anything important about today.</p> <p><a href=\"http://goo.gl/I0tPQQ\"><a href=\"http://goo.gl/I0tPQQ\" class=\"linkified\">http://goo.gl/I0tPQQ</a></a></p> <p>GETTING THERE BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT - Harvard Square is the closest T stop (red line).  Check Google Maps or other to find fastest way there from wherever you are.</p> <p>GETTING THERE BY RIDE SHARE - a lot of players in this meetup come by car and are nice enough to offer rides to others. Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.</p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium.  They will patrol for cars parked illegally.</p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.</p> <p>ATTIRE - Bring a *white* shirt and a dark/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams.  DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine.  Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.</p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better.  That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled.  Check here right before heading over.</p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes.  Most people playing do this for fun and/or exercise in the middle of the day.  Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:</p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely return to the office/class afterward.</p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.</p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball. </p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony/legal matter.</p> <p>WHAT ELSE - All skill levels welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest updates for today's meetup.</p>",

I caution that we should be wary of the “wiki-pixie dust” myth that deploying a wiki will automatically foster the collaboration and success one sees at Wikipedia. I will frame our round-table discussion by identifying the technical and collaborative attributes of Wikipedia’s success with an appreciation of what is novel to its mission and historical circumstances. I’ll also briefly demonstrate how Wikipedia collaboration works and compare it to other platforms including <a href=\"https://www.google.com/docs/about/\">Google Docs</a> and <a href=\"https://hackpad.com/How-to-use-Hackpad-mlZvEsJykI5\">Hackpad</a>.”</p> <p><b>In keeping with the spirit of the TNB Roundtable series,</b> this session will not be a sales pitch for any product or service.  It will be a professional development opportunity for nonprofit professionals who want to learn with and from their peers in other organizations.</p> <p><b>Please also note:</b></p> <p>1) This session is for employees of nonprofit organizations. It is not designed to meet the needs of vendors, volunteers, students, consultants, job-seekers, and others.</p> <p><b>Register here: </b> <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tnb-roundtable-what-nonprofits-can-and-cannot-learn-from-wikipedia-registration-17266900765\"><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tnb-roundtable-what-nonprofits-can-and-cannot-learn-from-wikipedia-registration-17266900765\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tnb-roundtable-what-nonprofits-can-and-cannot-learn-from-wikipedia-registration-17266900765</a></a></p>",

From larger structural and character considerations to minor formatting and story bumps, we'll go page by page and suggest how to make your script tighter, evocative, and more compelling. </p> <p><br/>Please bring at least four copies of ONE of the following:</p> <p>1. Ten pages of an original feature screenplay (or a ten or less-page short film) that you wrote yourself.<br/>2. A treatment that you wrote yourself (one to two-page synopsis of the plot) for a proposed original screenplay. Please keep treatments to two pages maximum.</p> <p><br/>If you haven't written a script or treatment, then come with your questions and a willingness to provide constructive feedback for others.</p> <p><br/>Regardless of what you bring, be sure to <b>PRINT OUT COPIES</b> so that we can read it together. If you don't print them out, we'll have no way to workshop your work! At least four would be appreciated.</p> <p>If you haven't written a screenplay or treatment but are curious about the process, then we definitely have a place for you.

The increasing complexity and cost of global regulatory compliance diverts attention and resources from those efforts. The development of data standards, through industry partnerships like the Enterprise Data Management (EDM) Council, when combined with semantic technologies creates a synergy that can address both requirements. Development of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) from a regulatory mandate is one example of how public/private collaboration can work to the benefit of both. The Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) is an emerging standard from the Object Management Group (OMG) that exploits semantics to describe data so that it can be used for both data analytics and risk management. Semantic data standards enhance data governance through their ability to create transparency both internally and externally.</p> <p>ABOUT THE SPEAKERS</p> <p>David M. Blaszkowsky joined State Street in 2014 from the Office of Financial Research, US Department of the Treasury, where he was Senior Policy Advisor, working on data and technology issues related to financial institution and systemic risk, including standards, data strategy, and emerging data technologies.  Prior to joining the OFR, the Securities and Exchange Commission appointed David in October 2007 as Director of its new Office of Interactive Disclosure, which developed and implemented interactive data rules, standards (particularly XBRL), and analytical tools for SEC financial disclosures. At both the SEC and OFR, David co-created and helped promote the adoption of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), as an original member of the “Linchpin” team.  Before his stints in government, David managed several equity research and analytics businesses for Standard &amp; Poor's in New York. Before that, he was the director of strategic planning and development for McGraw-Hill's Construction Information Group, held finance and reengineering roles at Fidelity Investments, and was a management consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company, Price Waterhouse (now PwC) and Gemini.  David received his B.A. in Economics at the University of Chicago, and his MBA in Finance at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.  David lives in Boston with his wife and two daughters.</p> <p>David Saul is Senior Vice President and Chief Scientist at State Street Corporation, reporting to the Chief Information Officer.  In this role, he is responsible for proposing and assessing new advanced technologies for the organization as well as evaluating technologies already in use at State Street and their likely evolution in order to reinforce the organization’s leadership position in financial services.  Mr. Saul previously was Chief Information Security Officer, where he oversaw State Street’s corporate information security program, controls and technology.  Prior to that, he managed State Street’s Office of Architecture, where he was responsible for the overall enterprise technology, data and security architecture of the corporation.  Mr. Saul joined State Street in 1992 after 15 years with IBM’s Cambridge Scientific Center, where he managed innovations in operating systems virtualization, multiprocessing, networking and personal computers.  Mr. Saul serves as a Trustee of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary.  In 2007 he was honored with a Computerworld Premier 100 IT Leader Award.  American Banker named Mr. Saul as one of its Top Innovators of 2013 for his work on data semantics and standards.  Mr. Saul holds Bachelors and Master’s degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Our society is no longer moving as we once did. Opportunities for natural movement have diminished from long days of static sitting at work or school! It is affecting our attention, health and emotions. Learn how one community of makers put movement back into daily lives, using engaging items...a musical hopscotch, a jumping wall wired with a Makey Makey, a cardboard rocker and a pedaling machine that lights and plays music. Make something with us and experience how fun it is to move again! \"Over the weekend of August 8 and 9 the cities of Boston, Cambridge and Somerville will come alive with a public Fab Festival. The 3-city Festival is a celebration of making and creativity. The weekend includes exhibitions, demonstrations, cool performances, hands-on activities for the whole family, and talks and panels featuring great makers from around the world. The Fab Festival is free and open to the public. Check the Fab Festival program often as new, fun activities will be added daily by Fabbers from across the city and around the globe!\" -- www.fab11.org</p> <p><br/>HATCH will be participating in FABFest, we are going to make a community project called \"Make to Move\" to present during our workshop. We are going to build an electric device that will help people get interested in exercise. We will be discussing ideas and taking suggestions during our first meeting.</p> <p><br/>If you are interested in working on this project or just want to learn more about what we are doing we will be meeting every Tuesday from July 7th through the 28th 6-8pm. Hope to see you there.</p>",

We meet every Tuesday at Athleta (92 Newbury Street) and will offer a 3 and a 4 mile loop around the esplanade. We have a no-drop policy, and welcome women of all paces and abilities, so you never have to worry about getting left behind. The staff at Athleta will securely hold your belongings for the duration of the run. We will try to start promptly at 6:30pm, so please arrive a few minutes early so that you can sign a waiver and introduce yourself to the group.</p> <p>One more thing! We will have a post-run social on the last Tuesday of every month at a local bar. Everyone knows that you need to replace the carbs after a good run, right? Right!</p>",

That's what it's all about. As simple as the idea is, it's amazing how much more you can get done simply by being in the presence of other writers at work. The baked goods don't hurt, either.</p> <p><br/>There is power for laptops, and some of us use pen and paper. Your choice! Bonus: there's no Internet access, so you can omit a huge distraction without even trying. And, although we are not a discussion group, there are many areas where people can go if they want to talk without being disruptive.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Quite-Write/messages/boards/thread/16019682\">Please click here for detailed directions!</a> The school can be a bit of a maze and I don't want anybody getting lost.</b></p>",

There have been a lot of new additions to the group, and it's great to see new friendships being made over board games...</p> <p>Although we start around 6:45pm or so, early birds (before 6pm) can take advantage of their <a href=\"http://www.notyouraveragejoes.com/medford/2012/09/04/late-night-happy-hour/\">half-price happy hour menu</a>. These are full-portion sized appetizers for real cheap! If not, you'll still be able to take advantage of the monthly specials.</p> <p>HOW TO GET THERE</p> <p>This location is easily accessible from Rt. 16, Rt. 28 and Rt. 93, and is walking distance from the T, near the new Station Landing apartment complex. Here is a map of the area.</p> <p>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.</p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.</p> <p>See you there!!</p>",

We're so excited to learn more about the local farmers making that possible in our city!</p> <p>Join us at Greentown Labs in Somerville for drinks, snacks and discussion around Boston's great urban ag projects.</p> <p><b>6:30PM - 7:00PM</b> Hang out and enjoy refreshments!<br/><b> 7:00 - 7:15PM</b> Intro by Jamie Byron<br/><b> 7:15 - 7:30PM</b> City Growers/ Urban Farming Institute   <br/><b> 7:30 - 8:00PM</b> Jessie Banhazl from Green City Growers<br/><b> 8:00 - 8:30PM</b> Drinks, discussion </p> <p><b>Jessie at Green City Growers (creators of Fenway Farms)</b></p> <p>Jessie has managed Green City Growers since inception in 2008 to profitability while establishing GCG as the leader in urban agriculture in the Northeast. Jessie was named “…arguably the queen of Boston’s urban ag visionaries” by Stuff Magazine, among the Top 40 Under 40 by Boston Business Journal, Top 30 Under 30 by Zagat, and a Root Cause 2013 Social Innovator. In 2015, Green City Growers and the Boston Red Sox launched a 5,000 square foot rooftop farm on top of Fenway Park that provides fresh, organic fruit and vegetables to Red Sox fans. </p> <p><b>City Growers/ Urban Farming Institute </b></p> <p>City Growers works with community partners to secure land in the city for growing food. Imagine the positive impact of converting abandoned city lots into thriving green farms -- that's how City Growers is contributing to the new green economy in communities where economic revitalization is needed most. In the coming years, they'll create a checkerboard of productive green space in Boston’s inner city where local growing talent thrives.</p> <p><br/><b>With an introduction by Jamie Byron at Grove Labs! </b></p> <p>Grove Labs is a Somerville startup empowering everyone to grow their own food one aquaponic system at a time. Our first product, the Grove Ecosystem, is a residential aquaponic system designed to fit seamlessly into your kitchen. It's connected to a mobile app that guides you along the way and connects you to other users in the community. We aim to make aquaponic indoor growing a more approachable, viable and efficient way to produce your own fresh, organic food at home.</p> <p>------</p> <p>A note about our venue, Greentown Labs: </p> <p>We enable entrepreneurs to solve big energy problems. We face a growing global population and the resources required to meet expanding demand is today's most pressing challenge. New ways of producing and consuming energy are necessary to address this problem while minimizing further damage to our environment. We believe entrepreneurs are capable of innovating and inventing solutions to address this challenge with access to the right tools, resources, network and support -- that's where we come in.</p>",

We're so happy to report that it could hardly have gone better, with complimentary hors d'oeuvres, beer, wine, and cocktails plus music from the Baha Brothers, and two auctions -- a perfect night out for nearly 600 Courageous friends and supporters who came out to Charlestown.</p> <p>Through the generosity of all of our sponsors and guests, we raised over $100,000! Every dollar goes directly to support Courageous kids, helping them not only to learn how to sail, but also to succeed in life. As you know, Courageous Sailing exists to serve Boston kids - 1100 this year, our biggest group ever. And Courageous continues to exist because of all our supporters. With your help, Courageous kids are building self-confidence, life skills, and job skills - and most would never have this kind of opportunity without Courageous.</p> <p>We're already looking forward to Make-a-Mark 2015 -- hope to see you there! Until then, catch up withphotos from the 2014 event on Facebook.</p> <p>Complimentary Beer, Wine, Cocktails, Hors d'Oeuvres, &amp; Live Music</p> <p>Local businesses pitched in to make the 2014 event even more memorable. Complimentary beer, wine, and and cocktails provided by Dirty Water Distillery, Gosling's Dark n Stormy, Samuel Adams, Gordon's Wines and Premier Bartending paired well with delicious hors d'oeuvres from The Fireplace, Capers Catering, Pier 6 and Captain Mardens. Under the Peterson Party Center tent, the Baha Brothers kept things lively all night long.</p>",

We find this helps our customers develop deep skills in computer use as a key part of business strategy and action.</p> <p>Computer Care and Learning has a longstanding internship program, where we train people to be skilled computer helpers, and we also help run the Get Connected! clinic, which provides refurbished computers to customers with low and moderate incomes.</p> <p>To learn more, come to the meeting, call us at[masked], or email [masked]</p> <p><b>FINALLY</b>, thanks for reading this far.  I'm always open to your comments and suggestions, and even your questions and clever jokes (especially the latter).</p> <p>Regards,<br/>-steve<br/>Steve Isenberg<br/>President, BNUG</p>",

Of half-burnt firecrackers, of gathering dandelions, of Grandma's belly-busting dinner. It was a summer of sorrows and marvels and gold-fuzzed bees. A magical, timeless summer in the life of a twelve-year-old boy named Douglas Spaulding—remembered forever by the incomparable Ray Bradbury. -from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Dandelion-Wine-Grand-Master-Editions/dp/0553277537/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433942714&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=dandelion+wine\">amazon.com</a>.</p> <p><br/>Please support our host restaurant!

We have a good library of widely played board games, and people normally bring many more of them. We regularly run three to five tables of board games - this provides enough variety.  It is normal for people to get two or three games a session.  The game night format was inspired by <a href=\"http://www.unitygames.org/\">Unity Games</a> and the event is very casual and structureless.  If you have gone to one of the meetup's quarterly events you will know.</p> <p><b>Q &amp; A:</b></p> <p><b>Q.  What types of games are played?</b><br/>A.  Any type of board game.  Browse through the most popular games at <a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/\"><a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://boardgamegeek.com/</a></a> and that should give you an idea.</p> <p><b>Q.  Until when do you play games?  Can I arrive later than 7pm?</b><br/>A.  Until the last game of the evening ends, usually past midnight.  Yes, you can arrive later than 7pm, but you may have to wait for a new game to start if you do.</p> <p><b>Q.  Should I bring something?  </b><br/>A.  If you want, bring a game you feel comfortable teaching. There will be pizza and sodas served. Feel free to bring snacks or beverages to share or chip in $5 to $10 for the pizza/sodas in the pizza cup. </p> <p><b>Q.  I really want to play XYZ game, can we schedule it?</b><br/>A.  Some people ask for interest in a particular game on the event comments below.  This may be the way to make sure you get to play the game you want. </p> <p><b>Q.  Where do I park?</b><br/>A.  The driveway is the obvious spot, but eventually it will fill up on most of these game nights.  Some people do park on the street.  The soccer field parking across the street is a safe option and is the suggestion the town police gave me when I asked about overflow parking.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Join us for a once-in-a-lifetime, family-friendly event in Phillips Auditorium at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics on Tuesday, July 14, between 7:30 PM and 9:30 PM. For 9-1/2 years, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft has been coasting towards a fateful encounter with Pluto and its moons. On July 14th, it will arrive! After a journey of nearly a decade, its Close Encounter phase will last just 48 hours. During the busiest hours of the flyby - including the moment of closest approach - the spacecraft will be too busy to communicate with Earth as it soaks up all the data it can during its mad dash through the Pluto system. Once it resumes transmitting, it will still take an additional four hours for its signals, traveling at the speed of light, to reach Earth! But a lot could go wrong. At the speed it’s moving, it wouldn’t take much of a high-speed impact with any undiscovered moon, possible ring, or other unseen debris to disable or destroy the spacecraft just as it’s making its closest approach to the planet. Will New Horizons survive long enough to “Phone Home” and send us its treasure trove of images and measurements? We’ll know the minute that NASA does! We’ll be presenting a Live NASA TV broadcast from the Mission Operations Center, including interviews, videos, and status updates, right up until the receipt of the spacecraft’s “I survived” chirp (expected at 9:09 PM)!</p> <p>Afterwards, if it’s clear, we’ll have telescopes on the roof aimed at Pluto’s location in the sky (plus other targets of opportunity). Pluto is too faint to be visible even in our telescopes, but it’s possible a few photons reflected by the planet may hit our retinas! It should all be great fun, as we’ll have a raffle, photo ops in front of an artistic Pluto landscape, 3D-printed models of New Horizons, and who knows what else! This will probably be the last time in our lives that we will be seeing a “New World” up close for the very first time. Don’t miss your chance!</p> <p>The event will be hosted by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and presented by John Sheff, a NASA Solar System Ambassador and Boston-area amateur astronomer.</p> <p>As with all CfA events, admission is free. No reservations are required; seating is first come first served.</p> <p>We will open the doors at 7:00 and will be prepared to open overflow rooms if needed, as with our regular Observatory Night programs.</p> <p>Clear skies,<br/>Christine</p> <p>Source(s):<br/>eMail from Christine Pulliam</p>",

I'm not going to be able to make it to all of them, but I'll set them all up as Meetups in case anyone else wants to take advantage. I'll keep my RSVP status current. Also, there are rain dates for each of these shows so if they're cancelled I'll move the date accordingly.</p> <p>The Birds will certainly have you watching the sky over your head at the Greenway! See one of Hitchcock's best in an ideal new setting. I will unfortunately be on a cruise during the week of this showing, but please attend if you can and let me know how amazing it looks!</p> <p>*Note: The shows technically begin at \"sunset\". I'm picking a time that's close to sunset, but I'm sure it will vary.</p>",

However, many of these are based on flawed premises that can lead to ill-informed trading decisions and bad results. </p> <p>Attend this very special presentation and learn how to avoid traps that even some professionals fall into, and learn to correctly interpret commonly misinterpreted options metrics. In this presentation, you will learn:</p> <p>How option probabilities change throughout the life of a trade and how to avoid incorrect interpretations of changing probability metrics.</p> <p>How to understand volatility myths and realities (you’ll be surprised about how you've been misusing volatility readings).</p> <p>How options Greeks change throughout the life of a trade and how to adapt your strategy.</p> <p>When Greeks are essential to a trade’s outcome and when they are irrelevant.</p> <p>How to trade with the confidence of a master trader, knowing your readings are accurate.</p> <p>And much more!</p> <p>This class will not be recorded and no Power Points or PDFs of the presentation will be made available, so please make every attempt to attend the live, in-person event.</p> <p>Also, at the end of the presentation, Dan will offer a trader education package that includes his online Group Coaching class with additional learning resources at a special club discount only for traders who attend this event in person.</p> <p>Following the presentation, Dan will be on hand for Q &amp; A to help you with your trading questions.</p> <p><b>Dan Passarelli</b> is an author, trader and former member of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and CME Group.

      "description": "<p>• Heal the emotional wounds of past relationships<br/>• Transform deep seated patterns of abandonment and rejection<br/>• Let go of unhealthy dysfunctional relationships<br/>• Develop the ability to remain centered in the core of your being<br/>• Become truly loving and accepting of yourself<br/>• Develop a warm magnetic presence that will draw others to you<br/>• Cultivate inner beauty<br/>• Increase your capacity to give and receive love<br/>• Attract a healthy and loving partner<br/>• Create healthier and more fulfilling relationships<br/>• Develop a stronger connection with the higher power<br/>• Learn to evolve spiritually through your relationships</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><br/>My friend Sema was telling me about how she had fallen for a man, but he had not called her in some time. Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn’t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.</p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema’s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn’t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way…</p> <p>Does this sound familiar?</p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.</p> <p>I’ve been there myself and I didn’t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.</p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.</p> <p>Learn to “digest” the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.</p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.</p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.</p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.</p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.</p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.</p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.</p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to “digest” our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.</p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.</p> <p>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.</p> <p>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses</p> <p>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.</p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.</p> <p>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.</p> <p>Discover the passion and power that resides within you</p> <p>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.</p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.</p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind</p> <p>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.</p> <p>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.</p> <p><b><i>Alternate Tuesdays at 7:30 PM at Unity of Somerville, located at 6 William Street at the corner of College Avenue</i></b></p> <p><b><i>Call (913)[masked] to learn more</i></b></p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

In this seminar you will discover self-imposed limitations that keep you from being, doing, and having all you want in life. As you tap into the courage of your heart, you will have the opportunity to walk boldly toward your dreams without being hindered by fear, doubt, or limitations.</p> <p>Many graduates describe this seminar as the most moving, liberating, and profound experience they have ever had, serving as a touchstone for the rest of their lives!</p> <p>Insight II: The Opening Heart Seminar is an advanced seminar that takes place over five days. Personal attention is given to participants in every major process. You will expand on what you learned in Insight I in ways that augment and complement your new skills. Your commitment to your Self will be rewarded with the experience of greater freedom and discernment in choosing healthier life enhancing relationships.</p> <p>The Insight II seminar is an intensive, dynamic five-day small group experience. With a maximum of 40 participants, strong bonds of trust and acceptance are quickly created and mutual respect and support are nurtured.</p> <p>Similar in some aspects to Insight I, the Insight II seminar places a greater emphasis on individual participation, games, interaction, and processes than on lecturettes.</p> <p>Profound breakthroughs in self-knowledge and a greater sense of expansion and empowerment are hallmarks of the Insight II experience.</p> <p>Objectives of the Insight II seminar include:<br/>• Cultivating greater ability to access loving, wisdom, intuition and strength-of-heart<br/>• Learning to release and heal limited patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving<br/>• Recognizing and experiencing the beauty of our Essential Nature<br/>• Expanding and trusting authentic Self-expression<br/>• Strengthening and healing relationships<br/>• Discovering and expressing talents<br/>• Gaining confidence in the ability to have, do and be what one dreams of in life<br/>• Discovering what’s really important<br/>• Creating a positive peak experience reference point and tools to guide participants through life outside the seminar</p> <p><b>Times</b>:<br/>Tentative Times are:<br/>Wed: Registration 10A; Seminar: 11A-11P<br/>Thur: 11A-11P<br/>Fri: 11A-11P<br/>Sat: 10A-11P<br/>Sun: 11A-8P; Graduation: 8P-9P</p> <p>Start times are firm.  Ending times depend on the group's dynamics.  Please expect to focus entirely on this experience during these five days; you will enjoy it.  You will want uninterrupted sleep and there is homework that will take up the morning.</p> <p><b>Food</b><br/>Arrive having eaten a hearty breakfast.  There are breaks every two-three hours.  Take snacks if you need them.  There is one lengthy (1.5 hour) break for a meal.  Many participants go out together to the many restaurants.  Some bring meals with them but note there are no refrigerators or microwaves in the hallway of the seminar.</p> <p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Insight I (<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Personal-Growth-Network/events/142513662/\">Available here</a>)</p> <p><b>A Last Word</b></p> <p>Representing education in its most essential sense, Insight II shines light on what is already inside each participant, rather than attempting to impart external information to them.</p> <p>The Insight II process provides numerous contexts for examining deep-seated beliefs and behaviors, so students can determine which support them in their deeper purpose and which hold them back. From an expanded perspective, participants can make choices that serve them in relating, working and living more effectively. Insight II broadens and deepens the self-exploration work begun in Insight I. For many students, this seminar creates an opportunity for them to open to the magnificence of their authentic Self.</p> <p><b>Janet Parker</b></p> <p><br/>Janet Parker has devoted over 20 years, as a facilitator of personal growth seminars, as a facilitator of business training programs, and as a personal coach, to help people in all walks of life create happier and more fulfilling lives.  </p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/1/f/4/600_321709652.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Ms. Parker is a facilitator with Insight Seminars, and also leads her own workshops including <a href=\"http://www.lifewisetraining.com/lifewise-one.html\">The Lifewise Series</a>, <a href=\"http://www.lifewisetraining.com/chalice.html\">The Chalice for Women</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.lifewisetraining.com/teen-leadership.html\">Teen Leadership Seminar</a>. Janet's facilitation is recognized and respected around the world, having facilitated seminars for adults, teens, and children across the U.S. and in Europe, the Caribbean, South America and Israel.  Her clients describe her style as dynamic, inspiring, compassionate, and creative.</p> <p>She also develops and facilitates training programs for businesses in leadership, communication skills, and teamwork.

Now is only temporary and we have 100% of our lives to live. Let's make the most of it! </p> <p>There will be complimentary crudité and cheese and crackers. Also, if you are driving to the event, you can park at 75 State Street and the Harborside Inn will validate your ticket for a discounted rate.</p> <p>Please check out <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/HOPE-for-Single-Parents-Boston-and-Metrowest/photos/19926132/\">photos </a>from our May 20th event.</p> <p>Thank you!</p> <p><i>\"The discomfort of choosing to do something outside of your comfort zone is temporary... it's the distress of not doing it that lasts forever.\"  - </i>Eric Roberge, Founder of Beyond Your Hammock</p> <p>Thank you!</p>",

Please come and join us for a casual 2 hours ASL social on Wednesdays from 5:30 to 7:30 pm.</p> <p><br/>WHO: All who are interested in ASL are welcome to join us. Whether you're Deaf or hearing, beginner or fluent ASL user, we're here to share and socialize in this beautiful language.</p> <p>WHERE: We'll be in the Starbucks on 755 Boylston Street in Back Bay.

This lecture series is held each summer, and is free and open to the general public. Midsummer Nights' Science at the Broad Institute takes place at 415 Main Street (formerly 7 Cambridge Center), in Kendall Square in Cambridge.</p> <p>I am coming directly from work, so depending on the T, I will be there as close to 5:30 as I can. We will head in for seats by 6:45. I will be wearing a meetup pin.</p> <p>If you are concerned about getting good seats, as this is a popular event, feel free to go in when you arrive.</p> <p>There is a reception in the lobby after, but I would rather go to dinner with some fellow nerds and discuss the lecture, and whatever else we would like to talk about. I will wait in the lobby by the doors for a few minutes before heading out to get dinner.

Understanding the adaptations that facilitate and maintain the relationships between the members of this co-evolutionary triangle can give us insight into the fascinating biology of malaria, and also provide keys to controlling or eventually eliminating this disease. Daniel Neafsey, associate director of the Broad’s Genomic Center for Infectious Disease, will describe how recent developments in genome sequencing are giving us new perspectives on malaria, a disease that has been called the strongest known force of evolutionary selection in the recent history of the human genome.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.broadinstitute.org/node/4040\">Dan Neafsey</a><br/>Daniel Neafsey joined the Broad in 2004 and is now associate director of the Broad Institute’s Genomic Center for Infectious Disease, where he leads a group that focuses on the genomics of malaria parasites and mosquito vectors. He is excited by the potential for new technology and bioinformatic approaches to turn the tide against disease like malaria. Neafsey’s current projects involve the application of comparative genomic and population genetic analyses to Plasmodium malaria parasites and Anopheles mosquitoes to study population structure, natural selection, and genomic factors underlying parasite and vector phenotypes that impact public health. Neafsey’s interests also include the use of pathogen polymorphism data to inform vaccine design and understand vaccine efficacy; analysis of drug resistance mechanisms and evolution; the use of clinical genotyping data to interpret disease transmission dynamics; and the development of new genomic protocols and informatic tools to address key questions in infectious disease and global health.</p> <p>Before joining the Broad, Neafsey received his B.A. at Loyola University (Chicago) and completed his Ph.D. at Harvard University, with a focus on population genetics and genome size evolution of pufferfish (a short-lived model organism for genome studies and exceedingly minor threat to public health). He received the Broad’s inaugural Excellence Award in Science/Engineering in 2013.</p>",

      "description": "<p><b>Come join me in exploring two great Photography exhibitions at the MFA Free Wednesdays</b></p> <p><b>Herb Ritts</b> </p> <p>(1952–2002) was a leading American fashion photographer of the 1980s and 1990s, known for his beautifully printed, formally bold, and sensual black-and-white images of supermodels such as Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell. This new exhibition of the photographer’s work revisits the artist, whose groundbreaking 1996 retrospective, “Herb Ritts: WORK,” remains one of the most popular exhibitions in MFA history. The Ritts Foundation has given the Museum a print of every image in the 1996 exhibition, and in 2007, supported the MFA’s first gallery dedicated solely to photography. The Museum’s Herb Ritts and Clementine Brown galleries host the new exhibition, featuring an array of Ritts’s photographs celebrating the human body and embracing the carefree California lifestyle.</p> <p><b>Unfinished Stories: Snapshots from the Peter J. Cohen Collection</b></p> <p><br/>Spanning the 20th century, the more than 100 found photographs in “Unfinished Stories” depict a century of image-making by private photographers. “A quick shot fired by a hunter without deliberate aim,” reads the original definition of a snapshot from the early 19th century. The term “snapshot,” popularized shortly after the invention of Kodak’s box camera in the 1880s, came to describe photographs of everyday life using a handheld camera. Speedy new technology boosted the ability to create a visual diary, commemorating events and personal moments, road trips and holidays. Now, more than a century later, these once ubiquitous and now historic, silver gelatin photographs are rapidly being replaced by Instagram and other digital forms of photography, hence a new appreciate for such photographs.</p> <p>“Unfinished Stories” celebrates a century of snapshots from the Peter J. Cohen Collection of amateur photographs. An avid collector, Cohen rescued more than 50,000 lost, discarded, or disowned personal photographs, culled from flea markets, antique shops, galleries, eBay, and private dealers. As he sifted and sorted through his finds, Cohen discovered mesmerizing, often humorous, shots removed from their original context: People at Play, Photographers’ Shadows, Double Exposure, Couples, Oddities, and Hula Madness. These pictures reveal the lives of strangers through intimate exposures, telling a story, or as Cohen puts it, “a teeny part of a story that remains unfinished.”</p> <p>“Unfinished Stories” celebrates unexpected discoveries in these compelling visual objects, each representative of what makes photography such a rich form of expression and a deep cultural symbol for everyone who’s had to stand still and say, “Cheese!”</p>",

      "description": "<p>Another open spaces Meetup in the spirit of DevOpsDays! Bring some devops-\"y\" issues you'd like to talk about with the group.</p> <p>The theme of this event is making decisions - how do the organizations we are a part of make decisions, technical or otherwise? Are there improvements we can make in this process?</p> <p><b>how it works:</b></p> <p>1. You write an 'issue' you would like to discuss and present it to the group (briefly).</p> <p>2. We'll organize the issues into a timeline, so people can move from group to group.</p> <p>3. When we run out of ideas or timeline space, we break out into groups and start talking.</p> <p>This format is based on <a href=\"http://www.devopsdays.org/pages/open-space-format/\">how they do it</a> at devopsdays. Check the link for more info.</p> <p>If you can't think of an issue to discuss, no problem. You can join breakout groups based on your interest.</p> <p><b>some ideas as examples:</b></p> <p>• Build vs buy</p> <p>• What will DevOps look like for us?</p> <p><br/>• Staffing - who do we need, and when?</p> <p><br/>• Tooling decisions in and across teams</p> <p><br/>• Events - what do we go to, do we sponsor?</p> <p>• and so on...</p> <p><br/>See you all at TeraData on July 15th!</p>",

This event is part of our \"Wednesday Night Magic\" series.</p> <p>It doesn't matter if you are an expert \"planeswalker\", or don't know anything about Magic: The Gathering -- you can come to play or learn this amazing strategy game.  There are usually between 6-12 people at each event, consisting of all experience levels.  All decks of all types are welcome for this \"casual play\" event.  Beginners who want to learn are welcome!</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/7/3/event_17823955.jpeghttp://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/7/7/event_17823959.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/2/8/4/highres_100133892.jpeg\" /></p> <p>This location is easily accessible from Rt. 16, Rt. 28 and Rt. 93, and is walking distance from the T, near the new Station Landing apartment complex. Here is <a href=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/f/e/highres_16055326.jpeg\">a map of the area</a>.</p> <p>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.</p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that MTG Boston members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.</p>",

To minimize potential stains on the rug, I will select 3 or 4 summer whites to taste. We still can bring food of course, but let's try to keep it neat. Food ideas to follow.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/d/6/9/600_439091625.jpeg\" /></p> <p>LOOK! Movie -- and security -- start at 7pm on the dot; please plan to arrive 6:30. Helpers at 6pm.</p> <p><br/>Sideways won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and was nominated for four other awards. It profoundly affected the wine biz here in the US: Mile's famous love monologue to Pinot Noir caused sales -- and prices -- to jump. Likewise, his rant \"<i>If those bi*ches order Merlot I'm out of here!</i>\" depressed Merlot sales til this day. But there's a twist, which I encourage all of you to research and discover for yourselves. There will be a quiz.</p> <p><b>COST</b></p> <p><b>$20 when you RSVP.</b></p> <p><b><i>NOTE: We are now using Meetup's preferred payment service WePay. Let Jim know if there are any issues.</i></b></p> <p><i>Usual refund policy applies. I will refund 100% up to 1 day in advance of the event. After that time, no refund (but members are free to work out swaps on their own).</i></p> <p><b>POLICIES</b></p> <p><b>Seats are limited to 18 total, so no guests. RSVPs will be rolled out over a few weeks, and I may promote newbies up from wait list. Everyone must be a member of BostonWine or live at Hanover. RSVP early, but please don't RSVP unless you're sure that you can make it.</b></p> <p><b>NOTE: As part of the RSVP process you will be asked to accept the group's Policies and Disclaimer (use a new web browser window to see the About Us section of our group). You must answer \"Yes\" in the RSVP to attend this event. (Note, apparently some versions of the Meetup mobile app don't display this question -- in that case, use a web browser later on to update your RSVP). </b></p> <p>Sideways is a 2004 comedy-drama film written by Jim Taylor and Alexander Payne and directed by Payne. Adapted from Rex Pickett's 2004 novel of the same name, Sideways follows men in their forties, Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti) and Jack Cole (Thomas Haden Church), who take a week-long road trip to Santa Barbara County Wine Country. Payne and Taylor won multiple awards for their screenplay. Giamatti and Church, as well as actresses Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh, playing local women who become romantically involved with the men, all received accolades for their performances.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/4/7/8/event_208914392.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>WHAT TO BRING</b></p> <p>We will supply wine. You should bring food, plates, wine glasses, etc.</p> <p><b>WINE</b></p> <p>1. 2014 Limestone Hill Chardonnay from de Wetshof Estate, Roberson, South Africa $15. Wow! Hard to beat this one: unoaked, so crisp with grapefruit and pear nose, followed by minerals on the palate from the limestone, THEN rich butter like a California chard. Very nice! I'll bring some smoked salmon salad on \"petites toasts\" to go with. :-)</p> <p>2. 2012 Pouilly-Fumé \"En Travertin\" from Henri Bourgeois, Sauvignon Blanc from the Loire valley, France, $23. Strong classic \"gun flint\", smokey Sauvignon Blanc nose, similar to a Sancerre which is near by. This wine was recommended by our member Daniel and I think it would be fantastic with any kind of goat cheese.</p> <p>3. 2012 Gewurztraminer, Trimbach, Alsace, France, $23. Ahh, Gewurz! Dry, but with an incredibly fragrant, spicy nose. Trimbach is a solid producer so this will give you a good introduction to a classic grape and style. Wonderful sipping on its own, superb with fondue (!!), or with vinegary Alsatian or German food (e.g., German potato salad).</p> <p>4. 2013 Vigneti Di Foscarino Soave Classico, Inama, Verona Italy, $24. We'll finish with this Italian white from the Venice area. I haven't had it, but reviews are excellent and this is a top producer. Complex floral / pear nose, rich in the mouth, some describe it as oily, some lemon and minerals. Summer in Venice, what could be better?</p> <p><br/><b>WHERE</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hanovercambridgepark.com/\">Hanover CambridgePark</a> <br/>160 CambridgePark Drive <br/>Cambridge, MA 02140 <br/>Phone:[masked]</p> <p>T stop: Alewife (Red line)</p> <p>Parking: No parking at the venue (yet!) Best to take T.  Otherwise, park at Alewife T station ($7). Park and walk to main lobby of 160 and follow general directions. </p> <p>The Hanover CambridgePark is a new luxury apartment building complex in the Alewife area of Cambridge. It has a spacious club room where we'll be meeting, a spa-like pool, fitness center, pool, courtyard with fire pits, grills, high-end finishes, etc. Expect to see many more BostonWine events here in 2015!</p> <p>For those interested in seeing a model apartment, leasing staff will be on hand before the event to do a tour (call ahead to be sure to get a spot). Remember to let them know that you're part of BostonWine. ;-) </p> <p>Look forward to seeing you! </p> <p>-Jim</p>",

      "description": "<p>From Landmarks:</p> <p>Dear Friends,</p> <p>Due to inclement weather and the high risk of lightning in the forecast for this afternoon and early evening, we are moving tonight's free concert to Emmanuel Church, 15 Newbury Street, Boston, MA 02116. </p> <p>Due to limited seating, wristbands will be handed out on a first come, first served basis starting at 6 pm. The concert will begin at 7 pm.</p> <p>For directions and parking information, please visit <a href=\"http://click.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=39045557&amp;msgid=397284&amp;act=8KX0&amp;c=876224&amp;destination=<a href=\"http://www.emmanuelboston.org/about/directions\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.emmanuelboston.org/about/directions</a>\"><a href=\"http://www.emmanuelboston.org/about/directions\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.emmanuelboston.org/about/directions</a></a>.</p> <p>Though we are disappointed that our concert has to be moved indoors this week, we are delighted that Emmanuel Church is available to us as a rain location!</p> <p>On days when the weather is questionable, it's tempting to try to stay at the Shell until the last minute and see if the weather clears up, and some people have asked why we can't simply go back to the Shell later in the day if conditions improve.  The reality, however, is that an orchestra is like a huge ship—it can't change directions quickly. In addition to the 60 musicians with their instruments of all sizes, we have a sound crew, a stage crew, instrument movers, volunteers, and many other people to coordinate.  Set up at the Hatch Shell takes all afternoon, and can’t be done if there is rain or lightning in the area.</p> <p>If you’d like to see how much time and effort goes into turning the Hatch Shell and lawn into an outdoor concert call, check our time-lapse video at <a href=\"http://click.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=39045557&amp;msgid=397284&amp;act=8KX0&amp;c=876224&amp;destination=<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DALiLxKgEIbo\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DALiLxKgEIbo</a>\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALiLxKgEIbo\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALiLxKgEIbo</a></a>.  It’s fascinating and informative!</p> <p>Moving and setting up at the rain location also takes several hours, and so decisions must be made early in the day. Even if the weather clears later in the day, the opportunity for turning the \"big ship\" of the orchestra back around has been lost.</p> <p>Thank you for your understanding and support, and we hope to see you at Emmanuel Church this evening.  We are confident that we have made the right decision to protect everyone's safety, and to ensure that the show will go on!</p> <p>Boston Landmarks Orchestra</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/f/9/a/600_389316762.jpeg\" /></p> <p>From Landmarks:</p> <p>July 15 at 7:00 pm</p> <p><br/>(rain date July 15th) </p> <p>7/10 update ****The rain location for July 15 is Emmanuel Church.****</p> <p>\n\nOpening Night: Rhapsody in Green</p> <p>Mysteries of the sea resonate in Debussy’s La Mer and Hovhaness’s And God Created Great Whales, a work featuring actual whale songs.

Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent/collaborative work time.</p> <p>Inspiration for Maptime comes from both hack nights and knitting circles. Both are models of spaces for people to create and learn together. Our goal is to provide this space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions.

      "description": "<p>Boston Food Forest Permaculture Speakers Series continues with Josh from D Acres farm!</p> <p>Come hear Josh share practical examples of alternative building, renewable energy, holistic forestry, no-till gardening, hospitality management, community outreach, and more</p> <p>For almost twenty years, D Acres of New Hampshire has challenged and expanded the common definition of a farm. As an educational center that researches, applies, and teaches skills of sustainable living and small-scale organic farming, D Acres serves more than just a single function to its community. By turns it is a hostel for travelers to northern New England, a training center for everything from metal- and woodworking to cob building and seasonal cooking, a gathering place for music, poetry, joke-telling, and potluck meals, and much more.</p> <p>Josh Trought helped to found D Acres of New Hampshire in 1997, and today serves as its director. He is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Colorado Boulder with a degree in environmental conservation, and has worked for organizations as diverse as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Costa Rica’s Tapantí National Park. Currently he is a member of the Artistic Roots co-op in Plymouth, New Hampshire, and serves as treasurer of the Pemi-Baker Solid Waste District. His proudest accomplishments are as a participant at the Bread and Puppet Theater; at La Caravana Arcoiris por la Paz, a mobile ecovillage that traveled across Central and South America; and at D Acres, where he has specialized in forestry, construction, gardening, and administration. The primary motivation behind his life’s work is the healthy perpetuation of our species within its various, diverse ecologies.</p>",

      "description": "<p>A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail<br/>by Bill Bryson<br/>4.05 of 5 stars 4.05 · rating details · 184,398 ratings · 10,342 reviews<br/>Soon to be a major motion picture starring Robert Redford and Nick Nolte.</p> <p>The Appalachian Trail trail stretches from Georgia to Maine and covers some of the most breathtaking terrain in America–majestic mountains, silent forests, sparking lakes. If you’re going to take a hike, it’s probably the place to go. And Bill Bryson is surely the most entertaining guide you’ll find. He introduces us to the history and ecology of the trail and to some of the other hardy (or just foolhardy) folks he meets along the way–and a couple of bears. Already a classic, A Walk in the Woods will make you long for the great outdoors (or at least a comfortable chair to sit and read in). (less)</p>",

This event is open to anyone, and usually doesn't have any sort of pre-arranged agenda -- anything you can bring is fair game, provided you can get it done in three hours!</p> <p>* Your gallant host almost always brings something to play, and takes requests if you get said request to him by Tuesday night at the latest.

I doubt this will be much of an issue, given our typical attendance numbers.</p> <p>* Because our events tend to be small, and the games we typically play tend to be long, if at all possible, please let us know if you plan to be more than a couple of minutes late so that we don't launch into something without you. Likewise, if you're planning on arriving more than a half-hour late, you should be aware that it may not be possible to include you in a game. You're welcome to come by and hang out but the chances are better than even that we'll be hip-deep in gaming goodness by the time you arrive.</p> <p>* Please be respectful of our hosts; stay mindful of closing time and throw 'em some business if you're hungry.</p> <p>* Have fun and roll high!</p>",

      "description": "<p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/8/600_436680296.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Welcome to our regular meetup!  We are a casual group of people who enjoy playing board games -- specifically, the kind of board games that <b>make you think.</b>  We play a variety of games, most of which are <b>Euro </b>style games of medium complexity.</p> <p><i>This season, in addition to playing games, we will be raffling off a bunch of popular games!  There will be raffles at each meetup. </i><b><i>Simply by showing up, you'll get a chance to win free games.</i></b> <i> The more often you come, the more entries you'll receive.</i></p> <p>Our weekly meetup is in a <b>TERRIFIC space for games</b> steps from the Kendall Square T, with easy parking, and lots of room to spread out in.  Full directions are below.  The building door does get locked in the evening, but there is plenty of foot traffic in and out.  If you expect to arrive later than 8:30, send Tucker a message ahead of time, and we'll make sure someone is there to let you in.</p> <p>Our meetups happen once a week (alternating Mondays and Wednesdays), from 7:00 pm until 11:00 pm or later.</p> <p>Our group has been running since 2007, and at this point we have a pretty large crowd of regulars.  A lot of people come once every few weeks, and <b>RSVPs are appreciated but not required, so the RSVP list is often smaller than our actual attendance.</b>  We expect about <b>30-45 people</b> at most of our meetups.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/b/600_436680299.jpeg\" /></p> <p>We play whatever people bring, which typically includes a lot of Euros.  Here's a \"tip of the iceberg\" look at a few games that have been popular lately:</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/b/7/600_438366583.jpeg\" /></p> <p><i>7 Wonders, Terra Mystica, Race for the Galaxy, Splendor, One Night Werewolf, Le Havre, Hansa Teutonica, Machi Koro, Concordia, Super Big Boggle</i></p> <p>As you can see, there is some real variety.  A few of our regular attendees bring about 20-30 games between them, so there's always a lot to choose from.  But if you have a game you like, just bring it with you!</p> <p>People new to Euros are very welcome.  But be aware that you are <b>NOT </b>likely to find traditional American games (like Monopoly, Sorry, Risk, or Poker); the heaviest strategy games (like 18xx or wargames); or pure abstract games (like Chess).</p> <p>Finally, a note about <i>Settlers of Catan</i> and <i>Carcassonne.</i>  These are traditional \"gateway games\" that many people play when they first discover Euros.  Although you will occasionally find those games at our meetups, many of us have played them to death and have become more interested in games with a little more complexity to them.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/9/600_436680297.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>OUTBOUND (from Boston / from Park Street)</b><br/>Take the Red Line to Kendall Square station. Exit at the gates at the front of the train. Cross the street. (If you take the escalator up, turn around first to see the street.) After crossing, proceed behind the T entrance (perpendicular to Main Street).  Building E25 is the brick building a quarter block down, across from the parking lot.</p> <p><b>INBOUND (from Alewife / Porter / Harvard / Central)</b><br/>Take the Red Line to Kendall Square station. Exit at the gates at the rear of the train. Take the stairs or elevator straight up. Proceed straight ahead (perpendicular to Main Street). Building E25 is the brick building a quarter block down, across from the parking lot.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/a/600_436680298.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>FROM BOSTON (or Memorial Drive)</b><br/>1) Take Massachusetts Ave heading north (cross the river if coming from Boston).  Memorial Drive is the first cross street past the river; go past it.<br/>2) Take the first right, onto Vassar St.  (Vassar is the first right after Memorial Drive.)<br/>3) Take the first right, onto Main St.<br/>4) Pass two signals, then turn right onto Hayward.  You may park in the parking lot on the right side of Hayward.  An MIT parking permit is NOT required in the evening, but please do not park in the spaces marked Medical. Exit the parking lot at the rear (opposite from where you entered). Building E25 will be directly across the street.</p> <p><b>FROM CAMBRIDGE (or points west)</b><br/>1) Take Massachusetts Ave heading south.<br/>2) Take a left onto Vassar St.  (Vassar is the last left before Memorial Drive; there is a railroad crossing there.)<br/>3) Take the first right, onto Main St.<br/>4) Pass two signals, then turn right onto Hayward.  You may park in the parking lot on the right side of Hayward.  An MIT parking permit is NOT required in the evening, but please do not park in the spaces marked Medical.

      "description": "<p>The Boston Austrian Economics group is proud to present our very own, Levy Ulanovsky, as he leads an open discussion about his years under the communist system; including growing up with a father that despised the Soviet regime in private and taught him to be a free thinker, as someone who valued liberty, the free market, competition and private property. As a refusenik and dissident in the 1970's, Levy plans to address many matters; including:</p> <p>1) Why did the Communists relinquish their iron grip on Russia without a fight?<br/>2) Who played which role?<br/>3) A disagreement between Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman was whether a system should be judged by its results. Many ex-Soviets, like Ayn Rand, abhor the “ends justify the means” idea.<br/>5) In Israel, the Left dominates the media, the campus, and the courts, yet why do they lose elections by a wide margin?</p> <p>Levy is also looking forward to questions from his favorite free market economists, the Austrians.</p> <p>Light refreshments will be provided, we ask for a suggested donation of $5.00 to cover the cost.</p>",

At the usual time of 7-9pm. </p> <p>John Wiegley has agreed to come out and give a talk on </p> <p><b>\"Using Nix with Haskell\"</b></p> <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p>An introduction to the Nix package manager (but not the OS), focused on using Nix to aid Haskell development, including working with different versions of GHC and packages, multi-package projects, ghci, and more.</p> <p>Since Nix can be installed alongside existing package managers without conflict, users may participate by installing Nix on their laptops during the presentation and following along. To get a head start on this process, run these commands in a user account on Linux or OS X:</p> <p>    curl <a href=\"https://nixos.org/nix/install\"><a href=\"https://nixos.org/nix/install\" class=\"linkified\">https://nixos.org/nix/install</a></a> | sh<br/>    nix-channel --update<br/>    export PKG=nixpkgs.haskell-ng.packages.ghc7101.ghc  <br/>    nix-env -Q -j2 -k -iA $PKG || nix-env -iA $PKG</p> <p>This should install GHC[masked] into your user environment, making the \"ghc\" command available when all is done. If it fails, please bring the output to the talk and be sure to ask the presenter before things start.</p> <p><b>Bio:</b></p> <p>John Wiegley is a researcher in formal methods and functional programming at BAE Systems; a member of the <a href=\"http://haskell.org/\">haskell.org</a> committee; and a frequent member of the #haskell IRC channel (as \"johnw\"). He maintains several packages on Hackage, such as gitlib, linearscan, async-pool, pushme, and others, and is also known for work in the Emacs community, and for the Ledger command-line utility.</p> <p><b>Logistics: <br/></b></p> <p>If you can, please plan on arriving between 6:45pm and 7pm, but there will be someone in the lobby to greet stragglers.</p> <p><b>Food</b>:</p> <p>Pizzas, salad and soda.</p> <p><b>Afterwards:</b></p> <p>If you'd like to stick around, a number of us tend to head down to the <a href=\"http://www.cambrew.com/\">CBC</a> or another pub afterwards to socialize. If you would like to give a talk or if you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to follow up here or email one of the organizers.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Type 2 Diabetes is epidemic in our society today, and is a major source of misery – and medical bills! – for a growing number of Americans. Many people afflicted with it have difficulty understanding how or why they got to this point, and believe that pharmaceuticals are their only option. Yet, understanding the underlying imbalances which culminate in diabetes is not as intimidating as it may seem at first. Insulin resistance, the primary metabolic dysregulation at play, is easy to comprehend and can be potently mitigated by dietary strategies and herbal remedies. Learn how to get started!</p> <p>This class is not intended to replace medical diagnosis or treatment, only to teach you more about your own body and give you the tools to make meaningful changes in your own health.</p> <p>Wednesday, July 15th, 2015\n<br/>7:00 – 9:00pm\n<br/>25 St. Mary’s Court, Brookline</p> <p>The fee for this class is $25.<br/>Register for class by emailing us at [masked], or calling[masked]-5274.</p>",

(Hi Doctor Nick!)</p> <p>\n\nOkay, so <b>Chris Nakis</b> and I are doing another great $5 comedy show at <i>The Hideout</i> (basement bar of <i>Durgin Park Restaurant in Faneuil Hall</i>) 8pm on Wednesday, July 15th. There's going to be another fantastic lineup featuring:<br/><b>Jenny Chalikian</b><br/><b>Peter Martin</b><br/><b>Dan Boulger</b> (who has been seen frequently on The Late Late Show w/ Craig Ferguson</p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/NQslMbd8A7M\" class=\"embedded\">https://youtu.be/NQslMbd8A7M</a></p> <p>)<br/><b>Dana Jay Bein</b> (from ImprovBoston)<br/><b>Al Park</b> (Winner of The Boston Comedy Festival)<br/><b>Jason Cordova</b><br/>&amp;<br/><b>Matt Donaher</b> (who was recently on Conan on TBS <a href=\"https://youtu.be/WgDjpGpHMYc\" class=\"embedded\">https://youtu.be/WgDjpGpHMYc</a></p> <p>) This is going to be another great, cheap, hilarious comedy show, so I hope you can make it out.<br/>The Hideout does serve food, so no need to stop off for diner anywhere else (I mean, you can if you want, there are plenty of places to eat in Faneuil Hall, but you don't have to.) The last show was a blast, and it was so good meeting new people (one or two how hadn't been to a comedy show before), so I'm excited for this one as well. See you all soon!</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/8/c/600_439471628.jpeg\" /></p> <p>(I like making fliers.)</p>",

A world called Varekai.</p> <p>From the sky falls a solitary young man, and the story of Varekai begins. Parachuted into the shadows of a magical forest, a kaleidoscopic world populated by fantastical creatures, this young man sets off on an adventure both absurd and extraordinary. On this day at the edge of time, in this place of all possibilities, begins an inspired incantation to life rediscovered.</p> <p>The word Varekai means \"wherever\" in the Romany language of the gypsies the universal wanderers. This production pays tribute to the nomadic soul, to the spirit and art of the circus tradition, and to the infinite passion of those whose quest takes them along the path that leads to Varekai.</p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/e/e/f/600_437932975.jpeg\" /></p>",

      "description": "<p>Join 50 to 80 or 100 dancers any Wednesday at Dance Freedom!!</p> <p>We are the original barefoot weekly dance, continuously running for 44 years, that has spawned hundreds if not thousands of other dances around the world.</p> <p>In a drug, alcohol, and shoe-free environment, we've been making friends and sharing safe and juicy dances for decades. Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.</p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.</p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.</p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!</p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.</p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

      "description": "<p>NUTSHELL - every week day, 12:15ish until 1:45ish, Cumnock Turf Fields at Harvard Stadium, games of 4v4 up to 10v10 or larger depending on who shows, bring a white shirt and a dark/colored shirt (but not a gray one), almost never canceled, read below for more details before asking questions that are answered here, and read the comments for today's meetup to see if there is anything important about today.</p> <p><a href=\"http://goo.gl/I0tPQQ\"><a href=\"http://goo.gl/I0tPQQ\" class=\"linkified\">http://goo.gl/I0tPQQ</a></a></p> <p>GETTING THERE BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT - Harvard Square is the closest T stop (red line).  Check Google Maps or other to find fastest way there from wherever you are.</p> <p>GETTING THERE BY RIDE SHARE - a lot of players in this meetup come by car and are nice enough to offer rides to others. Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.</p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium.  They will patrol for cars parked illegally.</p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.</p> <p>ATTIRE - Bring a *white* shirt and a dark/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams.  DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine.  Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.</p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better.  That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled.  Check here right before heading over.</p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes.  Most people playing do this for fun and/or exercise in the middle of the day.  Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:</p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely return to the office/class afterward.</p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.</p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball. </p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony/legal matter.</p> <p>WHAT ELSE - All skill levels welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest updates for today's meetup.</p>",

Each block party will feature music from a different local band, along with a cash bar. The parties take place each week from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. at Dewey Square Park and once a month at Summer Street Plaza at Downtown Crossing.</p> <p>“We select bands for the block parties in a few different ways,” says Boston Calling co-founder Brian Appel. “We consult local press in the area to get an outside perspective, we allow bands to submit music over social media, and we often choose bands that we have worked with in the past, including Tigerman WOAH, who are kicking off this year’s series.”</p> <p>MAPS &amp; Directions: <a href=\"http://www.rosekennedygreenway.org/about-us/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.rosekennedygreenway.org/about-us/</a></p>",

      "description": "<p>On July 7th, OSGeo released the <a href=\"http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G_2017_Bid_Process\">RFP for hosting of 2017 International FOSS4G Conference</a>. That conference is on a three-year continental rotation between North America, Europe and Asia/Middle East/Africa/South America. This year’s conference is in Seoul, and the 2016 conference will be in Bonn, Germany. Which means that the 2017 conference again comes to North America.</p> <p>The first step in the bid process is submitting a 2-page “letter of interest” (LOI) to OSGeo. We’re convening a meeting to see if there is interest and support within this community for Boston/Massachusetts potentially hosting the 2017 International FOSS4G conference. Needless to say, we believe Boston would be a great and appropriate venue. In short, Boston has the potential to host an awesome FOSS4G conference.</p> <p>AppGeo, in association with AvidGeo, is willing to participate actively, and potentially lead the LOI effort, but this effort will not be successful without an energetic and engaged <b>Location Organizing Committee (LOC)</b>. And, the nascent LOC needs to be named in the LOI. As such, we’d like to invite any interested parties to a preliminary planning meeting scheduled for next Thursday at AppGeo’s office, with remote attendance also offered. Our goal would be twofold:</p> <p>1) Understand if there are any other ongoing efforts to attract FOSS4G to Boston<br/>2) Enlist support and volunteers for the LOC</p> <p>Please fill in our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/appgeo.com/forms/d/1B1YDEEwvK9IgKKiam1bikX4QeKCnOFXoQxSIwEDBo50/viewform\">5 question survey</a></p> <p><b>If you cannot attend in person</b> please feel free to <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/events/cvahqjvce72r7sinbs3faak56bo\">join us on Google+</a></p>",

Ideating Mobile Experiences</b> (6:35-7:00)</p> <p><br/>by Carlos Cardenas | <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/carlos-cardenas/3/641/596\">LinkedIn</a> </p> <p>We'll share the experience of using and developing the Mobile Ecosystem Matrix, a set of visual tools for generating mobile UX concepts for the Internet of Things. They are designed to assist in the creation, specification, and evaluation of new product and service concepts for future interactive experiences. They are developed to help rethink diverse input and output mechanisms that seek to extend functional, ergonomic, and proxemic behaviors afforded by our current mobile technologies. By overlaying technical functionality with social aspects of the intended user experience, it is also possible to create efficiencies in product features and specs and uncover potential for new services geared toward diverse audiences.</p> <p><br/><b>About Carlos.</b> Carlos’ career has focused on the connections between technology, design, and the human experience. He is currently vice president of <b>THE MEME design</b>, a strategic design consultancy focused on helping organizations discover opportunities for innovation and on developing new products and services. Clients include <b>Samsung Electronics</b>, <b>LG</b>, <b>Microsoft</b>, <b>iRobot</b>, <b>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</b> and <b>Boston Children’s Hospital</b>. He has been a guest lecturer and panelist at the <b>Harvard Graduate School of Design</b>, <b>Stevens Institute of Technology</b>, and at the <b>Industrial Designers Society of America</b>’s international conferences, teaching and speaking about strategic design research, experience design, and innovation. Prior to joining THE MEME he was co-founder of CAPO design as well as UX researcher at <b>Harvard’s Center for Design Informatics</b>. Carlos holds a Doctor of Design degree and a master's in design studies with distinction in the digital media concentration, both from the <b>Harvard Graduate School of Design</b>. He also received a graduate diploma in multimedia design and a Bachelor of Architecture, both from Universidad de Los Andes – Bogota, Colombia. </p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>2. Interactive Prototyping with Sketch &amp; Invision </b>(7:00-7:25)  </p> <p>by Jeremy Osborn  | <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyosborn\">LinkedIn</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremias\">Twitter</a></p> <p>Bohemian Sketch continues to gain popularity with UX designers who appreciate the program for its lack of bloat and ability to quickly generate UX prototypes and mockups for both mobile and web. Now you can take your Sketch designs to the next level and make them interactive. This session will show you how to best optimize and organize pages and artboards in Sketch for import into Invision. This is a practical session that will demonstrate how to add hotspots to add interactivity as well how to generate animated UI previews. Additionally you will learn the crucial \"round trip\" process between Sketch and Invision which involves sharing your prototypes, receiving feedback, and then updating your Sketch originals as needed.</p> <p><b>About Jeremy.</b> Jeremy Osborn is an accomplished author and the academic director of <a href=\"http://gymnasium.aquent.com/\"><b>Aquent Gymnasium</b></a>. He has built websites for Boston-area startups, developed a Graphic &amp; Interactive Design certificate program at <b>Boston University</b>, and consulted for a number of companies, including <b>Google</b>, <b>Microsoft</b>, and <b>Adobe</b>. His latest book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/HTML5-Digital-Classroom-Video-Training/dp/1118016181\"><b>HTML5 Digital Classroom</b></a>, is an excellent resource for learning the essentials of HTML5 and is available on Amazon.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>3. Behavior Modes</b> (7:25-7:50)  </p> <p>by lou suSi | <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/loususi\">LinkedIn</a> </p> <p>UX teams go to extraordinary efforts to outsource or research a set of personas to inform critical design decisions. Yet often these fictional artifacts of our early research become merely ghostly reminders of the people that use our designs in the real world. How can we better leverage these interesting character portraits? Can we somehow bring them to life to get a richer understanding of the experiences we’re designing? Behavior Modes introduces a new set of anticipated temporal complexities that nicely map to personas and scenarios, helping us to evolve more and more realistic stories with each iteration to drive key decisions throughout the UX design process.</p> <p><br/><b>About lou.</b> At <a href=\"http://arbornetworks.com/\"><b>Arbor Networks</b></a>’ Security Experience Innovation Labs, lou suSi guides the way to long-term, strategic, 'Blue Sky' prototyping and immersive testing for the firm’s critically acclaimed DDoS application suite for Arbor's enterprise and service provider customers. And as Director of Human Awareness Research for <a href=\"http://myownmindllc.com/\"><b>myOwnMind, LLC</b></a>, lou delves into his more personal and passionate entrepreneurial-side by designing unusually brilliant, inspiring <a href=\"http://storyfirst.org/\"><b>storyFirst</b></a> experiences that frequently touch upon <b>Design for Good</b>. lou has also taught a rather unique and tactile human centered <a href=\"http://usefication.org/ixd\"><b>interaction design</b></a> course at <a href=\"http://massart.edu/\"><b>Massachusetts College of Art and Design</b></a> and is slated to teach <b>UX</b> in the near-future for <a href=\"http://www.brandeis.edu/gps/\"><b>Brandeis' Graduate Professional Studies</b></a> program. </p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>4.

Just read a real estate investing book<br/>b. Attended your first seminar<br/>c. Watched a late night infomercial<br/>d. Listened to a webinar</p> <p>And You:</p> <p>a. Were told real estate is the fastest way to make money<br/>b. Are convinced that you will be able to leave the job that you hate within the next 2 weeks<br/>c. Thought about or have already paid $20,000 for a coaching program</p> <p>But You:</p> <p>a. Don't know what to do next<br/>b. Were told by someone that it would never work<br/>c. Are losing your confidence rapidly</p> <p>Don't be embarrassed. Every person that got into real estate that wasn't hand held by a family member and grew up in the business started out the same way. 90 percent or more of those who have gotten excited about real estate never ended up even trying. Thinking big, attracting money, and being in control of your own destiny sound good, especially when a polished salesperson is the one painting the picture. The reality is: Real Estate is a business and it is hard work. The only people who will tell you otherwise are trying to sell you something(seminar, a coaching program, a book, a subscription). That's the bad news.</p> <p>The good news is that there are a ton of easy steps that you can take in order to start moving in the right direction without doing anything drastic. And, if you put in the work, the results will come. On this webinar, Tom Cafarella of Ocean City Development, will discuss:</p> <p>1. Why real estate is the toughest industry to get into<br/>2. How it can be the best industry to be in once you have momentum<br/>3. Steps that you can take this week to start your real estate career<br/>4. The basics of wholesaling</p> <p>5.  Our training program that allows you inside access to our exact marketing programs that you can use to find deals to wholesale</p> <p>Tom is a principle of Ocean City Development and is head of acquisitions for the company. Tom has been on the front lines of Ocean City Development's team, and has helped his team to acquire over 34 properties in the past 6 months including both fix and flip and buy and hold transactions.</p> <p>To sign up, please go to:</p> <p><a href=\"http://ewebinars.com/webinar/?trackingID1=XXXXXXXX&amp;trackingID2=YYYYYYYYY&amp;landingpage=default&amp;expiration=default&amp;memberid=9778&amp;webid=jlppjxwrep&lt;a\" class=\"linkified\">http://ewebinars.com/webinar/?trackingID1=XXXXXXXX&amp;trackingID2=YYYYYYYYY&amp;landingpage=default&amp;expiration=default&amp;memberid=9778&amp;webid=jlppjxwrep&lt;a</a> href=\"https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/5474109221069365505\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>",

We will get to visit the museum afterwards and if people are up for it we can go grab a bite to eat/drink not to far from the ICA. I will have a Meetup sign and will be sitting at the tables closest to the band. Which is past the main stadium benches.</p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/476070/file-2555379261-jpg/ripe.jpg?t=1436208003658&amp;width=649\" class=\"linkified\">http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/476070/file-2555379261-jpg/ripe.jpg?t=1436208003658&amp;width=649</a></p> <p>\n\n\nLike any good pop-funk dance band, Ripe is dedicated to creating an unforgettable live performance. The seven-piece Boston-based band is heavily influenced by psychedelic music, evident in their vintage baja hoodies, afros, scruffy beards, and funk instrumentals. Lead singer Robbie Wulfsohn, whose silky vocals evoke Sting one moment and Jason Mraz the next, can also transform into purely soulful R&amp;B. This flexible pop component mixes seamlessly with the funk foundation of the trombone, percussion, saxophone, and organ. Working on their second EP, a follow up to debut Produce the Juice, it’s clear what the band’s number one goal is: as they belt on track Makin’ Ice, “I just want to make you move.”</p>",

It is entirely free and open to the public.</p> <p>To participate, please RSVP here, and arrive bearing enough copies of the text you’d like to discuss – whether prose or verse – for each participant to have their own. If you do not have the means to make copies of your writing, send the text by attachment to bostonpoetryunion (at) gmail (dot) com not later than the night before the workshop.</p> <p>Occasionally, the moderator will invite a member or guest speaker to open the session with a brief talk on some literary topic. If you’re interested in delivering such a talk, email the organizers and let them know! Likewise let us know if you’d like to suggest a writing exercise or event.</p>",

      "description": "<p>This monthly Meetup is a place to learn tunes and to play them slowly with other musicians. The tunes we play can be found here (<a href=\"http://files.meetup.com/4740542/Thursday%20Practice%20Session%20Tunes%20%2805-14%29.pdf\">Sheet Music</a>). Since the list is getting large we have started selecting a rotating list of about ten tunes a month that we will definitely play so that new members can have a chance to play along without learning every tune right away. I update this list and email it monthly.</p> <p>This is still a new group, and how we go about learning and playing is still a work in progress. But the goal is to have fun, and to get together with others who enjoy playing Irish music. Musicians of all levels are welcome. Since the goal here is for everyone to play, new members are encouraged to suggest tunes from the list and to suggest tunes to add to it. If the group as a whole knows a tune well, we'll play it slowly a couple of times, and then pick the tempo up a bit. </p> <p><b>Note on tempo</b></p> <p>If you have gone to a typical Irish Session, we play a little faster than half that speed. But we'll start tunes slowly enough that everyone should be able to play along and learn by ear. If you haven't been to a session it is best to just show up and see if the tempo suits you :)  If you like metronomes...  For Reels (4/4), Hornpipes (4/4) and Polkas (2/4) set the metronome from 100 to 140 BPM and play one quarter note per click. For Double Jigs (6/8), Slip Jigs (9/8), and Single Jigs (12/8) set the metronome from 65 to 95 BPM and play three eighth notes per click. </p> <p><b>Directions</b></p> <p><b>By Subway</b></p> <p>The closest Red Line stop is Davis Square. From Davis Square you can either walk Northwest on Holland Street or take the bus (the 87 or the 88) to Teele Square. It is about a 10 minute walk between Davis and Teele Square. You can recognize Teele Square as a 5-way intersection with a small triangular island having a sign that says Teele Square. From Teele Square walk North on Curtiss Street for 3 blocks to Powder House Boulevard. The church is on the NE corner of the intersection.</p> <p><b>By Bus</b></p> <p>The 87, 88, and 89 buses stop in Teele Square.  The 87 bus runs between Lechmere Station (Green Line) and Arlington Center. The 88 bus runs between Lechmere Station (Green Line) and the Clarendon Hill Busway. The 89 bus runs between Sullivan Square (Orange Line) and the Clarendon Hill Busway. You'll want to get off the bus in Teele Square. From Teele Square walk North on Curtiss Street for 3 blocks to Powder House Boulevard. The church is on the NE corner of the intersection. The 77 bus runs between Harvard and Arlington Heights. You can walk from Mass Ave to Teele Square.</p> <p><b>By Car</b></p> <p>There is parking behind the West Somerville School that is one block West of the church. Parking there is available after 5PM even though the signs are somewhat ambiguous. From Powderhouse, turn onto Curtis, heading up the hill toward Tufts. Take the first left turn from Curtis onto Raymond Street. Ignore the NO LEFT TURN sign, as it is only in effect during rush hours. Raymond runs behind the school. The lot is about half a block down Raymond on the left.</p> <p>Street parking is also available one block away on Packard Avenue from Powderhouse Blvd on the hill to the Tufts University campus. Pay attention to street signs to avoid parking in a restricted area.</p> <p>See the map at: <a href=\"http://clarendonhillchurch.org/location.html\"><a href=\"http://clarendonhillchurch.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://clarendonhillchurch.org/</a>...</a></p> <p><img src=\"http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/clear.gif\" /></p> <p><b>Accessibility</b></p> <p>The church has a lift that requires someone to move from a wheelchair to the chair on the lift. I haven't had time to look at this yet, but I will have someone show it to me over the holidays.</p> <p> </p>",

She is a certified instructor with Software Carpentry. Since 2013, she has been an instructor and helper at many workshops about Python programming and data analysis (including but not limited to Software Carpentry workshops). She spoke at SciPy 2013, useR! 2014, and co-instructed a tutorial at PyCon 2015. Marianne did a PhD in statistical physics (Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon, France, 2008–2012) from which she gained expertise in statistics and scientific plotting. Also, she TAed many tutorials and labs at the undergraduate level. Marianne thus has experience teaching a variety of audiences: non-programmers, novices, women groups, undergraduate and graduate students, scientists.</p>",

In this tale revolving around not just parents and children but brothers and sisters, cousins and caretakers, Hosseini explores the many ways in which families nurture, wound, betray, honor, and sacrifice for one another; and how often we are surprised by the actions of those closest to us, at the times that matter most. Following its characters and the ramifications of their lives and choices and loves around the globe-from Kabul to Paris to San Francisco to the Greek island of Tinos-the story expands gradually outward, becoming more emotionally complex and powerful with each turning page.</p>",

      "description": "<p><b>Itadaki downstairs bar</b> (Boston, Newbury St. between Gloucester and Fairfield) 7 pm to 10 pm</p> <p>Join me at this izakaya style venue for a pleasant evening of drinks, food and chats. Whether you're learning Japanese or English, buy a drink, join the table, and practice your new language in a friendly and relaxed environment. If you're a beginner or just interested in culture, you'll fit in fine! Don't miss out on this opportunity to learn and practice over a few drinks. Can't make it on time? Need to leave early? Not a problem. Just stop by if you can!</p> <p><b>If you are &gt;21 and plan to drink, please bring a MA state issued ID or passport. Other state IDs may not be accepted. Please order at the bar and take care of your own tab.</b></p> <p>Transportation: I highly recommend using public transportation. Not only is driving while intoxicated dangerous, but there may not be any parking available in the area. A lot of the <b>parking on Newbury St  is Residential Only </b>in the evenings, and many of the signs indicating this are very well hidden. If you insist on parking in the area, be aware that meter maids love handing out parking tickets around here. Best methods for public transportation are the green line subway or bus #1 to the Hynes stop.</p> <p>I have made an arrangements with the Itadaki staff for a simpler ordering method. Last time was very chaotic and stressful for the bartender, so lets do our best to not confuse the bartender. :)</p> <p><b>Ordering at Itadaki</b></p> <p>1) Order your first drink at the bar. If it's alcoholic, your ID will be checked at this time. You will also be  given a guest number to use the rest of the night.</p> <p>2) If you're at a table, the bartender will try to make several rounds throughout the night to take additional orders. Keep using your guest number and please feel free to order more food and drinks.</p> <p>3) Keep in mind we're a pretty large group so don't be offended or annoyed with the bartender if he doesn't get to you right away. If you have an urgent order, go request it at the bar.</p> <p>4) Please take care of your tab and don't forget to tip*. The management and staff are doing a lot to make this all possible.</p> <p>*Note: If the group is large, an 18% tip may already be included.</p> <p>See you there!<br/>~Lindsay</p>",
