There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>",

Growing up in the North End, then a teeming multicultural neighborhood, Addie\u2019s intelligence and curiosity take her to a world her parents can\u2019t imagine\u2014a world of short skirts, movies, celebrity culture, and new opportunities for women. Addie wants to finish high school and dreams of going to college. She wants a career and to find true love.<\/p> <p>Eighty-five-year-old Addie tells the story of her life to her twenty-two-year-old granddaughter, who has asked her \u201cHow did you get to be the woman you are today.\u201d She begins in 1915, the year she found her voice and made friends who would help shape the course of her life. From the one-room tenement apartment she shared with her parents and two sisters, to the library group for girls she joins at a neighborhood settlement house, to her first, disastrous love affair, Addie recalls her adventures with compassion for the na\u00efve girl she was and a wicked sense of humor.<\/p> <p>Written with the same attention to historical detail and emotional resonance that made Anita Diamant\u2019s previous novels bestsellers, <i>The<\/i> <i>Boston Girl<\/i> is a moving portrait of one woman\u2019s complicated life in twentieth century America, and a fascinating look at a generation of women finding their places in a changing world.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nWe will be <b>choosing<\/b> a book for October's discssion at this meeting; please come with a book suggestion.

We will discuss the current and future of the fight, and what we can do. We will talk about the hearings at Bridgewater State University, which hopefully a number of us attended.<\/p> <p>Governor Baker has directed Paul Sagan the Massachusetts Board of Education Chair to hold a series of public hearings around the state, which will solicit feedback from educators, parents, students and local officials on the PARCC exam and the real-world impact of Common Core standards on teaching and learning. The dates and locations are as follows. This is our opportunity to let our voices be heard.<\/p> <p>The next hearing is Monday, June 22, 2015, North Shore Community College \u2013 Lynn Campus, Gymnasium, 4:00\u20137:00 p.m.<\/p> <p>For those not as familiar with Common Core, we will also take some time to watch the presentation of Building The Machine. We will also see a clip or two from the hearings.<\/p> <p>If time permits, we will talk about Evan Sayet's to recent Boston appearances. Note he will be returning in the fall.<\/p> <p>NOTE: this event is being created by Patrick. Face Book has changed the rules (again) making it impossible to create a FB Public Event for GBTP.<\/p>",

In her new book '<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.ted.com\/new-ted-book-the-science-of-optimism\/\">The Science of Optimism: Why We\u2019re Hard-Wired for Hope<\/a>', Author Tali Sharot explores the reasons why.<\/p> <p>The concept of optimism is often linked with the name of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who held that <i>we live in the best of all possible worlds<\/i>, which Voltaire famously mocked in his satirical novel <i>Candide<\/i>.<\/p> <p>Most of us expect outcomes to be better than they are likely to be. We also suffer from what experts call <i>a narcissistic illusion<\/i>: we are above average, have better luck and have more talented children than others, etc., which cannot possibly be true for everyone.<\/p> <p>Although our prediction of the future influences our actions, which in turn determine the outcome, optimism bias also has negative effects: it can cause risky behavior, (the <i>'it won't happen to ME<\/i>' syndrome), and poor planning.<\/p> <p>Some studies show that mild optimists live longer, but does being healthier make you more positive or does being positive make you healthier? Doesn't worrying about the future allow you to prepare better?<\/p> <p>Even entire countries show different levels of optimism. The United States is more optimistic than Europe, even though we have the same culture.<\/p> <p>To prepare for this discussion please visit the following links:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/tali_sharot_the_optimism_bias?language=en\">The Optimism Bias<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/can-positive-thinking-be-negative\/?page=2\">Can Positive Thinking be Negative?<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/sharpbrains.com\/blog\/2013\/01\/22\/the-science-of-optimism-a-conversation-on-the-optimism-bias-with-neuroscientist-tali-sharot\/\">The Science of Optimism: A Conversation\u2026<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/learning.blogs.nytimes.com\/2012\/05\/23\/how-full-is-your-glass\/\">How Full is Your Glass?<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/03\/the-american-ethic-and-the-spirit-of-optimism\/388538\/\">What Makes Americans So Optimistic?<\/a><\/p>",

It is approximately 5 miles round trip (about two hours). We tend to split up and go at different paces. For GPS users, it's close to 5 Lynn Shore Drive (Lynn) with plenty of free street parking.<\/p> <p>Get some steps in and enjoy chatting with friends. Come early and make a day at the beach. Great park at Red Rock if you want to just sit and watch the waves for a while. The route is paved with ramps, so scooter users are welcome.<\/p> <p>We leave the meetup spot by 7:35, so please be on time! If you are late, park closer to Nahant and walk toward Swampscott, and meet up with us on the way.<\/p> <p>We are open to having walks other days of the week, or in other locations! If you know of a route that is lit at night, drop one of us a note about it.<\/p>",

The Friends Meeting House is located at 5 Longfellow Park, Cambridge, MA 02138 You can find a very good map here:\u00a0&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.fmcquaker.org\/FMC-Map_2006.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/fmcquaker.org\/about-friends-meeting-at-cambridge\/directions\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/fmcquaker.org\/about-friends-meeting-at-cambridge\/directions\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Parking is available after 6:00 in the loop off of Brattle St. that leads to the Friend's House, and there is a small lot in back of the Friend's House for those with limited mobility. After that, parking is a little tricky in Cambridge (lots of \"resident only\" signs), but you will find available parking on Mount Auburn St. near Friend's House and on Brattle St. as you head away from Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>Coming by the T is a great option, with the Friend's House being a lovely 15 minute walk out of Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>If you find you are running late, come anyway! The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Hello and welcome to another edition of the Manga Club! I hope you are ready for some excitement because this marks the third anniversary of our time together. Thank you all for sticking with me through the good times and the bad :)<\/p> <p>Since this is an anniversary meeting, I decided to go big, go strong, and pick a story epic enough to mark this milestone. Therefore, I thought it was time to tackle a classic I\u2019ve been saving for a special occasion. That\u2019s right, quite possibly the best known Shonen title on the planet, Dragon Ball by Akira Toriyama!<\/p> <p>That being said, it still did not seem like enough, so I decided to expand my ideas once again, and break from a tradition started from the very first meeting. Yes, I am talking about the ban on the \u201cBig Three\u201d as selectable titles. It was not an easy choice, but given the fact that one of them is already officially over and also features a blonde super powered kid who just keeps getting stronger, Naruto by Masashi Kishimoto made the final cut!<\/p> <p><b>Dragon Ball (3-in-1 Edition), Vol. 1<br\/>by Akira Toriyama <\/b><\/p> <p><i>A seminal series from a legendary creator. Dragon Ball, a wry update on the Chinese \"Monkey King\" myth, introduces us to Son Goku, a young monkey-tailed boy whose quiet life is turned upside-down when he meets Bulma, a girl determined to collect the seven \"Dragon Balls.\" If she gathers them all, an incredibly powerful dragon will appear and grant her one wish. But the precious orbs are scattered all over the world, and to get them she needs the help of a certain super-strong boy... <\/i><\/p> <p><b>Naruto: 3-in-1 Edition, Vol. 1<br\/>by Masashi Kishimoto <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Twelve years ago the Village Hidden in the Leaves was attacked by a fearsome threat. A nine-tailed fox spirit claimed the life of the village leader, the Hokage, and many others. Today, the village is at peace and a troublemaking kid named Naruto is struggling to graduate from Ninja Academy. His goal may be to become the next Hokage, but his true destiny will be much more complicated. The adventure begins now! <\/i><\/p> <p>Copies are available at the venue, and don\u2019t forget our special deal! On the night of the Manga Club, all participants get ten percent off all graphic novels in the store, and twenty five percent off any future Manga Club title releases in stock! So if you come to the June Manga Club event, you can get the July or August titles for twenty five percent off as available!<\/p> <p><b><i>BUT PLEASE REMEMBER, THIS DISCOUNT ONLY APPLIES TO VOLUMES IN THE STORE ON THE NIGHT OF A MANGA CLUB EVENT! THIS DISCOUNT DOES NOT APPLY AT ANY OTHER TIME OR TO A PREVIOUSLY RESERVED GRAPHIC NOVEL! THIS DEAL IS A GIFT NOT A PRIVILEGE SO PLEASE DO NOT ABUSE IT!<br\/><\/i><\/b><br\/>Thank you and I hope to see you there!<\/p>",

A lush, richly layered novel in which our world has been plunged into an age of unreason, Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights is a breathtaking achievement and an enduring testament to the power of storytelling.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In the near future, after a storm strikes New York City, the strangenesses begin. A down-to-earth gardener finds that his feet no longer touch the ground. A graphic novelist awakens in his bedroom to a mysterious entity that resembles his own sub\u2013Stan Lee creation. Abandoned at the mayor\u2019s office, a baby identifies corruption with her mere presence, marking the guilty with blemishes and boils. A seductive gold digger is soon tapped to combat forces beyond imagining.\u00a0Unbeknownst to them, they are all descended from the whimsical, capricious, wanton creatures known as the jinn, who live in a world separated from ours by a veil.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Centuries ago, Dunia, a princess of the jinn, fell in love with a mortal man of reason. Together they produced an astonishing number of children, unaware of their fantastical powers, who spread across generations in the human world.\u00a0Once the line between worlds is breached on a grand scale, Dunia\u2019s children and others will play a role in an epic war between light and dark spanning a thousand and one nights\u2014or two years, eight months, and twenty-eight nights. It is a time of enormous upheaval, in which beliefs are challenged, words act like poison, silence is a disease, and a noise may contain a hidden curse.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Inspired by the traditional \u201cwonder tales\u201d of the East, Salman Rushdie\u2019s novel is a masterpiece about the age-old conflicts that remain in today\u2019s world. Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights is satirical and bawdy, full of cunning and folly, rivalries and betrayals, kismet and karma, rapture and redemption.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Event Co-Sponsor: Nieman Foundation for Journalism: <a href=\"http:\/\/nieman.harvard.edu\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nieman.harvard.edu\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/nieman.harvard.edu\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Purchase the Book: Featured event books will be for sale at the event for 20% off.

        "description": "<p>NUTSHELL - every week\u00a0day, 12:15ish until 1:45ish,\u00a0Cumnock Turf Fields\u00a0at Harvard Stadium, games of 4v4 up to 10v10 or larger depending on who shows, bring a white shirt and a dark\/colored shirt (but not a gray one), almost never canceled, read\u00a0below for more details before asking questions that are answered here, and read the comments for today's meetup to see if there is\u00a0anything important\u00a0about today.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\"><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT - Harvard Square is the closest T stop (red line). \u00a0Check Google Maps or other to find fastest way there from wherever you are.<\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY RIDE SHARE - a lot of players in this meetup come by car and are nice enough to offer rides to others. Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

We welcome new additions to the group, and it's great to see new friendships being made over board games and cards...<\/p> <p>Although we start around 6:30pm or so, early birds can take advantage of their half-price happy hour menu. These are full-portion sized appetizers for real cheap! If not, you'll still be able to take advantage of the monthly specials<\/p> <p>\n\n\nHOW TO GET THERE<\/p> <p>This location is easily accessible from Rt. 16, Rt. 28 and Rt. 93, and is walking distance from the T, near the new Station Landing apartment complex.<\/p> <p>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p>",

Well now you can have all of those things at the best <i>Track workout<\/i> ever.<\/p> <p>Interest peaked? Read on for more details including the weekly workout.<\/p> <p>Meet at the Harvard Track as usual. See what the workout will be below.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=mccurdy+track&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;hq=McCurdy+Track&amp;hnear=McCurdy+Track,+Boston,+Suffolk,+Massachusetts&amp;t=h&amp;cid=4187297081850575590&amp;source=embed&amp;ll=42.366202,-71.128482&amp;spn=0.002774,0.00456&amp;iwloc=A\">View Larger Map<\/a><\/p> <p>The workout is a simple speed workout designed to add some variety to your run.<\/p> <p>The rest of this details the workout and highlights a few things I think are important to remember. Skip it if you would rather just wing it and meet us at the track. We'll fill you in there.<\/p> <p>If you have never run on a track before, don't worry if none of this makes sense right now. As much as I will try to prep you, it usually just takes a few laps around the track for all of this to sink in.<\/p> <p><b>The Workout<\/b><\/p> <p>The workouts vary on a weekly basis and are usually interval based. We sometimes do workouts that are fun and different. Come see what this weeks workout is!<\/p> <p><b>What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>1. The distances (200, 400, 800, etc.) are the distances we run on the track. Each lap around the track is 400 meters.<\/p> <p>2. Each lap is supposed to be run at a certain speed, based on your 5k pace. Don't know what your 5k pace is? Read my instructions below to calculate your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>*3. The recovery interval (RI), which is indicated in parentheses, may be a specified timed interval or a distance that you walk\/jog.<\/p> <p><b>Things to remember<\/b><\/p> <p>Track workouts are supposed to be FUN! Don't be intimidated or dread a track workout. This is supposed to be a fun supplement to your other \"normal\" runs. With all of us out there encouraging each other it should be a blast.<\/p> <p>Bring a running stopwatch\/wristwatch if you have one! Using the start\/lap\/stop function will help you pace yourself on each lap.<\/p> <p>Don't push it! If something hurts or starts to feel tight, don't risk an injury because you ran too hard on your first track workout of the summer. We have plenty of time to ease in...<\/p> <p>Bring water for the end!!!<\/p> <p><b>5k pace instructions<\/b><\/p> <p>Decide how fast you would like to run a 5k. Choose a time that is reasonable yet challenging. Convert that time to seconds, and divide the seconds by 12.5 (the number of 400 meter laps it takes to run 5k). That is your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>As an example, I might decide a reasonable yet challenging goal time for a 5k is 24 minutes.<\/p> <p>24 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 1440 seconds<\/p> <p>1440 seconds divided by 12.5 laps in a 5k ~= 115 seconds \/ lap<\/p> <p>This means that I will run the workout according to a pace of 115 seconds \/ lap.<\/p> <p>I will also have pacing charts available at the track, so don't fret.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.informalrunning.com\/category\/blog\/\">Blog<\/a><\/b><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Valerie Hammond will be leading this meditation.<\/p> <p>The Seated Awareness Meditation includes breath awareness, body awareness, sound awareness, thought awareness, and choiceless (open) awareness. In partnership with the Cambridge Ten Thousand Villages store, MindfulBoston teachers and teacher-trainees will be leading a series of Meditation events in the coming months as a service to our community.<\/p> <p>Place:<br\/>The Cambridge Ten Thousand Villages is located at<br\/>694 Massachusetts Avenue<br\/>Central Square, Cambridge 02139<br\/>Time:<br\/>6:45pm to 8pm<\/p> <p>Schedule:<br\/>There will be an informal schedule.<br\/>At about 6:45pm we'll set up some seats and have a chat about what meditation is about. This is the official start time for our event.<\/p> <p><b>The front door will be locked by 7:01. <\/b>Make sure to arrive either on-time or early!<br\/>The store's registers will be closed by 7:05 so that employees can join us in meditation.<\/p> <p>How to reserve your space:<\/p> <p>Please rsvp here or call the store to rsvp. There are no \"tickets\" but we would like a head count in order to prepare a big enough space for sitting together.<\/p> <p>Note: we typically have up to 30 people attend these events. RSVPing is pretty important because we need to move bookcases around to fit everybody in the space. Thanks!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Seating:<br\/>If you have hip\/knee or other reasons to need a chair, make sure to rsvp here and say 'reserve a chair' in your comments.<br\/>There are seven folding chairs and a few low stools. Zafu style cushions are sometimes available if the store has some in stock. But there are no guarantees. Most of us will be sitting on the floor. Feel free to bring your own pillow with you. What is planned:<br\/>The hour (or so) that we spend together will include: discussion about awareness and mindfulness meditation, and an experience of seated awareness meditation. The length of the meditation itself will probably be about 15 to 20 minutes long. No previous experience is required, the meditation will be easy for beginners to understand.<\/p>",

Professor of Microbiology at Tufts University, will discuss how these traditional foods are now serving a new purpose - as model ecosystems for microbiologists. From microbial war and peace on Camembert to the funk in your homemade kimchi, learn how some of your favorite foods are changing our understanding of the microbial world.<\/b><\/p> <p>Benjamin Wolfe is an Assistant Professor of Microbiology in the Department of Biology at Tufts University. His lab uses food microbial communities to address fundamental questions in microbial ecology and evolution. He received his B.Sc. from Cornell University in 2003 and his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 2010. He developed an interest in food microbial communities as a post-doc with Rachel Dutton at Harvard's FAS Center for Systems Biology.\u00a0 Benjamin is a passionate promoter of microbial literacy through teaching and writing. He has taught food microbiology courses at the Harvard Summer School and Boston University's Gastronomy Program and has taught classes or workshops at Formaggio Kitchen, the San Francisco Cheese School, and for artisan food guilds across the country. Benjamin is a regular contributor to the food magazine Lucky Peach and writes an online series about the biology of food for Boston magazine. He is a co-founder of MicrobialFoods.org, a website that digests the science of fermented foods.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>This is a free event, but limited seating is available. <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/a-scientists-story-of-research-and-funding-featuring-mits-dr-hazel-sive-tickets-17345170873\"> <\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/a-scientists-story-of-research-and-funding-featuring-mits-dr-hazel-sive-tickets-17345170873\"><b>We encourage you to you RSVP through Eventbrite: <\/b><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/delicious-rot-using-fermented-foods-to-unlock-secrets-of-the-microbial-world-with-benjamin-wolfe-tickets-18044608911\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/delicious-rot-using-fermented-foods-to-unlock-secrets-of-the-microbial-world-with-benjamin-wolfe-tickets-18044608911\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/delicious-rot-using-fermented-foods-to-unlock-secrets-of-the-microbial-world-with-benjamin-wolfe-tickets-18044608911<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n<i>Directions to Le Laboratoire Cambridge, 650 East Kendall Street Public Transit: Red line to Kendall Square, walk straight down 3rd Street, turn right onto Athenaeum Street, and left onto East Kendall Parking: There is a parking deck - the 650 East Kendall Street Garage - accessible by Linskey Way. <\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><i>If you purchase food or drink from Le Lab, your parking ticket can be validated for discounted rates.<\/i><\/p>",

        "description": "<p><b>Yours Sincerely, John S. Sargent<\/b><\/p> <p>John Singer Sargent comes to life through letters and\u00a0lore<\/p> <p>Behind the renowned paintings of John Singer Sargent lies another legacy\u2014a treasure trove of letters, photographs, and sketches that document the artist\u2019s world.\u00a0Among the correspondence, more than a dozen letters from Sargent to Claude Monet illuminate his lifelong friendship and admiration for the French Impressionist master. Another note, carefully written in a neat round hand, describes a certain portrait as a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d; it is signed Am\u00e9lie Gautreau, an appreciative sitter best known today as Madame\u00a0X.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In celebration of the recent gift to the MFA of The John Singer Sargent Archive, which establishes the Museum as the center for Sargent scholarship, this exhibition selected from the archive and the MFA\u2019s collection, brings Sargent\u2019s era to life, enhancing our understanding of the man and his work. The show features \u00a0watercolors, prints,drawings, correspondence, and photographs arranged around several themes. Caricatures of Sargent by his friends and fellow artists Henry Tonks and Max Beerbohm add a dose of humor to our view of this hard-working artist, while sketches, props, and photographs of his studios illuminate his artistry and reveal the spaces of his\u00a0labor.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Gonzalo Fuenmayor:\u00a0Tropical Mythologies<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>SMFA graduate Gonzalo Fuenmayor explores notions of national identity, geographic displacement, and colonial histories in his first solo exhibition at the\u00a0MFA.<\/p> <p>Fuenmayor\u2019s Colombian heritage and Latino identity collide in works that address Latin America\u2019s colonial past and its legacy. With an elegant flourish, he collages familiar symbols of Latin America with those of Europe, melding bananas and jungle foliage with ornate decorative objects and opulent architecture. His unexpected combinations harness the complex culture clash and enduring tension between the two regions. They also reference \u201cmagical realism\u201d\u2014the literary genre marked by a blend of the fantastic and mundane, perhaps best known today through the works of fellow Colombian Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Argentina\u2019s Jorge Luis\u00a0Borges.<\/p> <p>Fuenmayor earned his Master of Fine Arts degree at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in 2004. In 2013, he was awarded the School\u2019s prestigious Traveling Fellowship. He used the funds to visit part of his native country that he had never seen before: Leticia, Colombia\u2019s southern-most city, which sits on the banks of the Amazon River where Colombia, Brazil, and Peru converge. This inspired Fuenmayor to make work on a Colombian banana plantation; his first video art piece, on view in the exhibition, documents that\u00a0experience.<\/p>",

Here is <a href=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/9\/f\/e\/highres_16055326.jpeg\">a map of the area<\/a>.<\/p> <p>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that MTG Boston members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p>",

Many have experienced the evidence that the Law of Attraction holds a lot of power. Some have played with finding parking spaces and others have manifested cash in a matter of minutes.<\/p> <p><br\/>Why is it that some can create big desires instantly and others only get small wishes? What are some of the keys that help to speed up the process. One factor is that your intention and core beliefs play a vital role in determining your outcome. If you want to achieve success now, you can!<\/p> <p>For instance, when you concentrate on the positive, your life will be positive. It sounds simple enough, but many times people let negative emotions get the better of them. So what do you do to release the thoughts that move you away from your desires and attract pleasant thoughts that move you towards manifestation? It starts with becoming aware of these negative thoughts and then quieting the mind.

Our mission is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies.<\/p> <p><br\/>This open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge offers intentional support for the beginner. Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent\/collaborative work time.<\/p> <p><br\/>Inspiration for Maptime comes from both hack nights and knitting circles. Both are models of spaces for people to create and learn together. Our goal is to provide this space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Some people are experts, and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not do it together?<\/p> <p><br\/>Maptime is hands-on, so don't forget to bring your laptop!<\/p>",

I doubt this will be much of an issue, given our typical attendance numbers.<\/p> <p>* Because our events tend to be small, and the games we typically play tend to be long, if at all possible, please let us know if you plan to be more than a couple of minutes late so that we don't launch into something without you. Likewise, if you're planning on arriving more than a half-hour late, you should be aware that it may not be possible to include you in a game. You're welcome to come by and hang out but the chances are better than even that we'll be hip-deep in gaming goodness by the time you arrive.<\/p> <p>* Please be respectful of our hosts; stay mindful of closing time and throw 'em some business if you're hungry.<\/p> <p>* Have fun and roll high!<\/p>",

I'm asking people to bring the Daily Ukulele - available on Amazon and locally. If you don't have one yet I'm sure someone will let you look at theirs but I recommend getting it.<\/p> <p>The donation for the location will be $5\/person plus you have to purchase The Daily Ukulele from Amazon, ebay, music store, etc.. \u00a0Let me know if you have any questions..<\/p> <p>Pat Sorn<\/p>",

Designed to take players from level 1 to level 5 by the time the season ends in August, this is a great way to (re)introduce yourself to D&amp;D's current edition and get immersed in a storyline that harks back to the origins of the game.<\/p> <p>Pre-generated characters are available, as is help to build your own, so feel free to drop in or contact Ted Atkinson if you'd like more information.<\/p>",

It\u2019s also an opportunity to peacefully transform your problems, your fears, and any pain and stress in your life into something more positive.<\/p> <p>In our last session, almost everyone arrived feeling stressed and drained from their day.\u00a0 By the end of the evening, though, <i>everyone <\/i>felt a complete positive shift, with new insights for moving forward differently to experience more inner peace and calm throughout their day.<\/p> <p><br\/>We also consider meditating one of the most direct and easiest ways to connect to your greater Spirit-Self ; and to be in a vibration that allows all that you desire to easily flow to you. We think it's one of the most valuable practices you can have to effectively use the law of attraction, and to feel good (also important for manifesting good things)!<\/p> <p><b>Please join us for another evening of pure relaxed bliss; insight, inspiration, and upliftment!\u00a0 I make it really easy for you, too. So mark your calendars to save the date, RSVP YES, and we'll see you there!<\/b><\/p> <p>This will be the last meditation session this summer.\u00a0In September, we will return to our meditation sessions on the 1st and 3rd Friday evenings each month, beginning on Sept. 18th.\u00a0 And our other meetup events will begin again, as well.<i><br\/><\/i><\/p> <p><b>To encourage and support your practice, if you pay for 4 classes, the fee will be only $60 (in-person, cash or check).\u00a0\u00a0 Or, you can pay for one class at a time for $20.\u00a0You do not have to commit to attending every class, however, the more you attend, the more you will benefit!\u00a0 Just RSVP each time you want to attend. RSVP is recommended and appreciated, as well as showing up or changing your RSVP in a timely manner.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Here's the general description of these meditation sessions:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Are you aware of the many benefits of meditating, but can\u2019t get yourself to do it, or it\u2019s too difficult<\/b> <b>to do on your own<\/b><b>?<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Do you enjoy the collective energy and ease of guided group meditations?<\/b><\/p> <p><b>By participating in th<\/b><b>e<\/b><b>s<\/b><b>e<\/b> <b>guided meditations classes,<\/b> <b>you\u2019ll experience how<\/b> <i><b>simple,<\/b><\/i><i><b>delightful<\/b><\/i> <b>and<\/b> <i><b>easy<\/b><\/i> <b>it can be.

Michelle will take notes and post it on the Messageboard afterward so people can get involved if they are interested.<\/p> <p>See you then!<\/p> <p><b>Parking: <\/b>Free! Thanks to Sammie for the venue suggestion!<\/p> <p><b>This month's success story: <\/b>After meeting Brendon (Green Beatbox) at the first meetup, Michelle ended up shooting a couple of virtual reality music videos with him and World Champion Accordionist, Cory Pesaturo. Those will be up at youtube.com\/kill9tv next week. This is an example of the kind of collaborations\/friendships you can hopefully form by attening these meetups! :)<\/p> <p>Got a success story?

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

For weekly options traders, the monthly expiry is of little significance unto itself, but for the monthly options traders, it will hold more significance. <b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Mary-Lou Drozek<\/b> will be moderating this meeting. She has been trading options for about 5 years and is happy to share ideas.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/8\/a\/a\/600_374778602.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The meeting location is Panera Bread in Quincy, which has wifi and is visible from the North Quincy T stop on the Red Line. The location could possibly change, so please check back with the event page just to confirm the location before heading off to the meeting.<\/p> <p>-------------------------------------------<\/p> <p><br\/>* Meetup allows for scheduling \"the third Thursday of the month,\" but not the \"Thursday before the third Friday of the month,\" which is what we need. Using the Meetup scheduling system alone without intervention would mean that the third Thursday will be on expiration week except for those months starting on a Friday, as is the case in August of 2014; in which case, the meeting would fall a week after the monthly expiry week. We believe that we will be able to successfully manipulate this consideration in the meetup system to keep the meetings all on the Thursday evening before expiration Friday. If you see a meeting time that isn't the Thursday evening before expiration Friday, please let us know and we will correct it. Thank you.<\/p>",

All five band members perform vocals, with Jon Mills\u2019s throaty voice in the lead. This layered, harmonic sound, combined with banjos and bouzoukis, give the group a decidedly nostalgic, bluegrass feel. Self-described as \u201cperching harmonies atop a sound that is, in essence, folk wrapped in rock \u2019n\u2019 roll,\u201d Grey Season developed their musical style busking in the streets of Boston and Cambridge. It is impossible to not feel uplifted with their earnest and impassioned lyricism and bluesy guitar solos, combined to forge a bursting, spirited sound.<\/p>",

It is the source of all true art and science.' <\/i>- Albert Einstein\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Have you had an NDE? Has your perception of life and death changed in any way?\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\u00a0Come tonight and share your experience with others.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\u00a0The term 'Near Death Experience' was coined by Dr. Raymond Moody, who wrote the 1975 book 'Life After Life'.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\u00a0If you've experienced an NDE, you are invited to share your story.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nMeet with other NDErs who understand the profound effects that NDEs have upon people's lives.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nWhat is a Near-Death Experience? According to IANDS, the International Association for Near-Death Studies, the definition of an NDE is : 'a profound psychological event that may occur to a person close to death or, if not near death, in a situation of physical or emotional crisis. Because it includes transcendental and mystical elements, an NDE is a powerful event of consciousness; it is not mental illness.'<\/p> <p>\n\n\nAttendance is by donation.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThis is a benefit event. All proceeds benefit Our Weeping Angel Foundation, a charitable, non-profit foundation\u00a0that helps people find new pathways to healing and wholeness.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nPreregistration required, as space is limited.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nCall Kathryn McGlynn:[masked]<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\nEvent held at :<\/p> <p>The Healing Center at Our Weeping Angel Foundation<\/p> <p>190 Old Derby St, Suite 100<\/p> <p>Hingham, MA<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hypnosis.ws\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hypnosis.ws\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.hypnosis.ws<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\u00a0-or-<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.localendar.com\/publickm\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.localendar.com\/public\/km\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.localendar.com\/public\/km<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n.\u00a0<\/p>",

The tunes we play can be found here (<a href=\"http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/4740542\/Thursday%20Practice%20Session%20Tunes%20%2805-14%29.pdf\">Sheet Music<\/a>). Since the list is getting large we have started selecting a rotating list of about ten tunes a month that we will definitely play so that new members can have a chance to play along without learning every tune right away. I update this list and email it monthly.<\/p> <p>This is still a new group, and how we go about learning and playing is still a work in progress. But the goal is to have fun, and to get together with others who enjoy playing Irish music. Musicians of all levels are welcome. Since the goal here is for everyone to play, new members are encouraged to suggest tunes from the list and to suggest tunes to add to it. If the group as a whole knows a tune well, we'll play it slowly a couple of times, and then pick the tempo up a bit.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Note on tempo<\/b><\/p> <p>If you have gone to a typical Irish Session, we play a little faster than half that speed. But we'll start tunes slowly enough that everyone should be able to play along and learn by ear.\u00a0If you haven't been to a session it is best to just show up and see if the tempo suits you :) \u00a0If you like metronomes... \u00a0For Reels (4\/4), Hornpipes (4\/4) and Polkas (2\/4) set the metronome from 100 to 140 BPM and play one quarter note per click. For Double Jigs (6\/8), Slip Jigs (9\/8), and Single Jigs (12\/8) set the metronome from 65 to 95 BPM and play three eighth notes per click.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Directions<\/b><\/p> <p><b>By Subway<\/b><\/p> <p>The closest Red Line stop is Davis Square. From Davis Square you can either walk Northwest on Holland Street or take the bus (the 87 or the 88) to Teele Square. It is about a 10 minute walk between Davis and Teele Square.\u00a0You can recognize Teele Square as a 5-way intersection with a small triangular island having a sign that says Teele Square. From Teele Square walk North on Curtiss Street for 3 blocks to Powder House Boulevard. The church is on the NE corner of the intersection.<\/p> <p><b>By Bus<\/b><\/p> <p>The 87, 88, and 89 buses stop in Teele Square. \u00a0The 87 bus runs between Lechmere Station (Green Line) and Arlington Center.\u00a0The 88 bus runs between Lechmere Station (Green Line) and the Clarendon Hill Busway.\u00a0The 89 bus runs between Sullivan Square (Orange Line) and the Clarendon Hill Busway. You'll want to get off the bus in Teele Square.\u00a0From Teele Square walk North on Curtiss Street for 3 blocks to Powder House Boulevard. The church is on the NE corner of the intersection.\u00a0The 77 bus runs between Harvard and Arlington Heights. You can walk from Mass Ave to Teele Square.<\/p> <p><b>By Car<\/b><\/p> <p>There is parking behind the West Somerville School that is one block West of the church. Parking there is available after 5PM even though the signs are somewhat ambiguous. From Powderhouse, turn onto Curtis, heading up the hill toward Tufts. Take the first left turn from Curtis onto Raymond Street. Ignore the NO LEFT TURN sign, as it is only in effect during rush hours. Raymond runs behind the school. The lot is about half a block down Raymond on the left.<\/p> <p>Street parking is also available one block away on Packard Avenue from Powderhouse Blvd on the hill to the Tufts University campus. Pay attention to street signs to avoid parking in a restricted area.<\/p> <p>See the map at:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/clarendonhillchurch.org\/location.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/clarendonhillchurch.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/clarendonhillchurch.org\/<\/a>...<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/img1.meetupstatic.com\/img\/clear.gif\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Accessibility<\/b><\/p> <p>The church has a lift that requires someone to move from a wheelchair to the chair on the lift. I haven't had time to look at this yet, but I will have someone show it to me over the holidays.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

This week we're bringing you a triple threat of SketchHaus favorites, starting with Interesting Points - The Show! What is it about funny people that makes them interesting? Is it the things they know or the things they do? Is it the memories they share or the lies they make up? Whatever it is, it's hilarious. See what happens when your panel of comedians answers those questions, and find out what makes them interesting.<\/p> <p>Then: Wild Memory Nation. Boston's best roving storytelling show, featuring scripted comedy monologues by some of the city's - and country's! - funniest people. Storytellers are given a single topic and then spin their hilarious tales out. Featured everywhere from Johnny D's Comedy Presents, Phoenix Landing Comedy, ImprovBoston, and the Women In Comedy Festival, Wild Memory Nation promises true stories, real funny. This month featuring Dave Bartlett, Johnny Burns, Mike Sweeney, and Adam Finne.<\/p> <p>Stick around after that for Openhaus: Boston's best sketch open mic! Submit a sketch to be read by sketch performers! Don't have a sketch? Sign up to perform other people's sketches! It's a relaxed, supportive, eclectic, and fun time. Just show up and sign up!<\/p>",

I am putting this out for two people as a lottery.<br\/>Plan is to fly into San Francisco Friday August 21, pickup a camper van and drive to Yosemite. The permit is for Tuesday August 25. Sat, Sun, Mon will be for exploring Yosemite exact details to be planned as a group.<br\/>I have tickets already on southwest airlines out of Manchester at 5:50am. Check pricing on this flight as it would be good to fly out as a group. My wife and I are flying back Friday at 12pm though if you want to fly out Thursday we can drop you off at the airport. I have a tent sight reserved until Thursday and a camper van that fits 4 for driving, 2-3 sleeping . I have ordered a two man tent also.<br\/>Hike is 14.2 miles taking the Myst Trail (not Misty in August) with 4800' elevation gain. Last few hundred yards in steep and you actually use cables to\u00a0 ascend. Those with vertigo will not like this ascent or descent. The trail is well maintained, mainly stairs made into switchbacks and nothing like the NorthEast.<br\/>We can share costs of campground and van. About $350 each or you can get your own transportation and share the tent site for $50. Notice there are no more campsites available for booking in the valley. All 300+ sites sold out in 6 minutes.<br\/>Please check flights to see if it fits your budget and if you can get time off.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0I will do the raffle May 2nd.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:<\/p> <p><br\/>1. Our flight gets into San Francisco at 11:10am on Friday.\u00a0 If you have frequent flier miles on another airline and can get a flight as close to this we could work with that.<\/p> <p>2. We are still planning what to do Wednesday and Thursday.\u00a0 We have a few months to plan so we could hit San Fran for a few days or somewhere on the coast. One way or the other we have to leave Yosemite Thursday.<\/p> <p>3. If you want to go as a couple I am opening the raffle for that as well. Both need to be members of the group.\u00a0 Both sign up as Plus one.\u00a0 If you are the first name picked you both go. If you are the second neither goes and I select a third name.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Co-work and meet with us every other Friday in Coolidge Corner. The goal of this phase is to build a strong core community and solicit a lot of input on what people want from our to-be-determined permanent space. We have this space from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, so stop by and work with us anytime in that window. We will host lightening talks at 1:00 PM, so if you can only come for 30 minutes, that's the part you won't want to miss. A note on location: KI has been very gracious in inviting us to use a room in their building during this exploratory phase, even though we are not affiliated with them. Once we have a core community formed then we will secure our own permanent space. See you there!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nUPDATE (sent via email 8\/20):<\/p> <p>LOGISTICAL NOTES:<\/p> <p>1.\u00a0FOOD\u00a0- We are meeting in a synagogue that also hosts a preschool, which means it is a\u00a0kosher\u00a0and a nut-free\u00a0facility. I will bring some light snacks to share with the group. If you choose to bring your own food, it must meet both the following standards: (a) is marked kosher with a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.kosherquest.org\/symbols.php\">hechsher<\/a>\u00a0or is a fresh fruit or vegetable, (b) does not contain nuts.<\/p> <p>2.\u00a0LOCATION &amp; ENTRY\u00a0- The building is at\u00a0384 Harvard St,\u00a0Brookline, and we'll be in classroom #1 in the basement. Please enter through the door on Williams St.\u00a0<\/p> <p>3.\u00a0PARKING\u00a0- If you are driving, there is a convenient public, metered parking lot off Fuller Street.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4.\u00a0SUMMER\u00a0HEAT\u00a0- The weather forecast is calling for a high of 82 degrees tomorrow. I stopped by the room today and it didn't feel too hot, but I'd suggest dressing comfortably for the temperature.<\/p> <p>5.\u00a0DISCUSSION\u00a0- We'll hold a discussion at\u00a01:00 PM. If you can't make it, don't worry, I'll send out notes and a follow up survey.<\/p>",

There's also an admission fee of $10 (or less if you have a multipass). I hope that's okay for everyone. We'll meet on the top floor for a play date, and start potluck in the cafeteria, also on the top floor, at 11:00am. I hope to see you all there! -Michi<\/p> <p>\n\n\nIt's the end of summer! So sad... But let's celebrate the awesome connections we've built through this community, and the growing friendship of our little munchkins! Also both Ayako san and I are returning to work in September, so help us celebrate this occasion before panic sets in. Please bring some yummy food or drink to share. I'll bring plates, cups, utensils and napkins. Please bring your own serving utensils, though. As for food allergies, there's someone with dairy allergy (me) and another with egg allergy. Please feel free to share any other food restrictions in the comments section.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Oh, and first timers are welcome to join in the celebration. I hope to see you all there!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Michi<\/p> <p>For those I saw last week, we talked about doing a swimming pool this week, and potluck the following week, but Ayako san can't make it the last week.

The saying \"we are what we eat\" has much wisdom in it. What we eat nourishes us, gives us energy, and gives us life. If the food we eat is not healthy, it can pull us down. If we do not give proper access to food to everyone, those people without access cannot remain healthy. In order to have a thriving city and healthy society, we all need good healthy food. Let's make sure we not only have a plan in place to do this, but a plan of action to carry it out. Find out how you can tap into the network of people, nonprofits, farmers, and chefs who are working to insure good food for us.<\/p> <p>Food for Us panelist Othneil Uter, Urban Farmer, Boston Food Forest Coalition<\/p> <p>Othneil \"Utah\" Uter grew up in the tropics on a 1-acre food forest that he helped create and maintain. His current forest garden in Grove Hall, which he frequently gives tours of, boasts over 50 different species of fruit and nut trees, including staples like grapes and apples, and exotics like figs and Arctic kiwi. Utah currently works for a non-profit organization in Roxbury. He is the co-organizer for the Greater Boston Permaculture Guild. He also is a member and avid contributor to Permies.com, the largest and most viewed permaculture website on the Internet.

We alternate walks between the inner and outer loops which are both under 3 miles. It usually takes less than an hour. We walk past a playground too, so we could stop and play there for a while. Afterwards, we sit at the picnic tables under the trees by the visitor center and feed our babies, chat, etc.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will meet outside the visitor center in the upper parking lot on the Saugus side of the park, past the Kasabuski Skating Rink. \u00a0There are bathrooms with a changing table in the visitor center too.<\/p> <p>Running late? \u00a0No prob. You can always meet up with us at the picnic tables next to the visitor center after we finish the walk.\u00a0<\/p> <p>***By popular demand this is set as weekly event. \u00a0If the weather is bad we can change it to a different day or skip the week.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>For New Members AND NON-Members:<\/p> <p>For every sailor who walks through our door, start here! This FREE Orientation class will get you familiar with how everything works at CBI. The orientation class is the gateway to everything that CBI has to offer, whether you\u2019re a seasoned sailor or brand new to boats. Done entirely on the dock, your orientation will include a guided tour of CBI\u2019s boats and facilities, an overview of our classes and programs, as well as plenty of time to ask the questions that matter to you as a sailor. All orientations meet at the base of the American Flag Pole out on the dock, and runs for about half an hour. All are welcome to this class!<\/p> <p><br\/>Afterwards, we invite you to meet one another and ask about other Orientation class attendees' prior experience with sailing. Perhaps you can find a friend to take the Beginner Sailing classes together with once you join.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Friday Nights are also when CBI members go out for Informal Racing, so it is an exciting night to watch the sailors and learn more about how you can progress your skills after learning to sail. Certainly ask your Orientation instructor about the Friday Night Informal Racing and Informal Instruction if he or she does not mention it. If you have any questions, please feel free to post below!<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Released twenty years ago to poor box office returns and indifferent reviews, John Carpenter's \"In the Mouth of Madness\" has slowly but surely been building up a fanbase that recognizes it as one of the director's more underrated films and a fantastic tribute to the stories of writer H.P. Lovecraft.<\/p> <p>Sam Neill stars as John Trent, a cynical insurance investigator, who has been hired by Arcane Publishing to hunt down Sutter Cane, the publishing company's most successful writer. Trent's research soon leads him to Hobb's End, a town that technically shouldn't exist since it only appears in the stories that Cane writes.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Weirdness and madness eventually ensues.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/85763778\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/vimeo.com\/85763778<\/a><\/p> <p>To celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary and Lovecraft's 125th birthday this month, let's head over the the Brattle Theater in Cambridge, MA and check out \"In the Mouth of Madness.\" The movie starts at 7 PM. The plan is to get to the theater fifteen minutes before the movie starts for tickets, snacks and seats.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>If you haven't been to the Brattle before, here is a link for directions by car or public transportation.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.brattlefilm.org\/about-2\/directions-parking\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.brattlefilm.org\/about-2\/directions-parking\/<\/a><\/p> <p>UPDATES:\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nThe screening of \"In the Mouth of Madness\" is only a couple of days away, and I'm pumped to finally see this on the big screen. Like a lot of people, I never got to see \"Madness\" during its brief run in theaters in 1995. \u00a0So seeing it theatrically should be a real treat.<\/p> <p>\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to give the group some additional information about Friday. I plan on being outside the theater from about 6:30 to 6:50 PM. If you are looking for me, I will be holding a Meetup sign and wearing my Army of Darkness T-shirt. Come up and say \"Hi!\" I'd like to meet everyone in the group, if possible.<\/p> <p>\n\nIdeally, I would like to have us sit together. I'm aiming for us all to go for balcony seats. However, if you can't sit that far back, no worries.<\/p> <p>\n\n\"Madness\" is slightly over ninety minutes, and should wrap around 8:30ish. Once the movie wraps, try to exit on the right hand side of the theater where the bathrooms are. There is a short alleyway you will have to walk that leads towards a tree and bike rack. The group can assemble there.<\/p> <p>\n\nQuite a few people in the BHS group wanted the opportunity to meet after \"Madness\" to discuss the film and to socialize with fellow horror fans. So, I have went ahead and booked the group a table at John Harvard's on 33 Dunster Street in Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>\n\nIf you have never been to John Harvard's, I have included a link to their page below which will give you all the info you will need regarding directions, menu, etc. But the place is only a brief walk away from the Brattle and is very close to\u00a0the Harvard Square T stop.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnharvards.com\/locations\/cambridge-ma\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnharvards.com\/locations\/cambridge-ma\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.johnharvards.com\/locations\/cambridge-ma\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\nIf for any reason the group gets separated or you can't find the Meetup group, just head to John Harvard's after the movie \u00a0and ask for the table that is reserved for Jason and one of the staff will show you over.<\/p> <p>\n\nI think I've covering everything, but if you have any other questions, just bring them up below. Thanks and see you all on Friday!<\/p>",

Learn how Asian communities preserve their food using salt, garlic, and spices, sample our Drumlin Farm kimchi, and take home your own fermented project to carry you through the winter months.<\/p> <p>Bring your favorite knife if you have one. Jars will be provided. Meet at the Nature Center where you will be directed to the classroom space.<\/p> <p>MAS Members: $30<br\/>Non-members: $36<\/p> <p>Register here: <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1IXv9xe\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/1IXv9xe<\/a><br\/>(Registration is required)<\/p> <p>For more information, contact:<br\/>[masked]<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Mmmmaven, an Electronic Music Production &amp; DJ School hosts Boston Ableton User Group's monthly 'Ableton Live Meet-Up' featuring workshops &amp; demonstrations from their skilled production instructors + special guests. These meet-ups are a great opportunity to network with other musicians, get involved in the scene, and learn something new from the Ableton gurus.<\/p> <p>Demo Topics:<\/p> <p>Sound Design w\/ Hardware Synthesizers in Ableton Live\u200b w\/ Mitchell Owens\u200b<\/p> <p><br\/>In today's world of electronic music production, a lot of producers reach for software to use in sound design and audio effects. However, many electronic producers find comfort in the hands-on experience of creating sound with a physical instrument like a synthesizer. Being able to step away from the computer and focus on a single device whose sole purpose is sound creation, offers a higher level of focus when it comes to sound design. During this workshop we will discuss the pros and cons of working with hardware and how to incorporate these instruments into our music production. We will also get an opportunity to get hands-on experience with the synths and learn about how they work and how to operate them for the purpose of making music.<\/p> <p><br\/>Mitchell Owens is a guitar player, sound designer, and electronic composer\/producer from Durham, NC. He attended Berklee College of Music right here in Boston and has over 5 years of experience with Ableton Live producing and performing music under the moniker Subalias, as well as doing sound design and soundtrack composition for independent films and animations. Mitchell\u2019s music blends the organic and synthetic for a balanced fusion inspired by sample based Hip\u00adHop, Downtempo, House, Funk and R&amp;B. He believes in freedom of creation and expression and likes to cater to each students specific needs to teach them the proper skills and techniques to achieve their musical goals.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Please join us for an introductory crystals class on Friday, August 21, 2015, in the Library of the Democracy Center, from 7-9pm.<\/p> <p>About crystals: Throughout our history, mankind has utilized crystals and gemstones for their spiritual, therapeutic, and aesthetic attributes. In some cultures, people find them helpful warding off negative energies, promoting good fortune, or to sneak a glimpse into the future events. Others have learned to harness their inherent energies, to call upon divine influences during summoning or ritual incantations For whatever the purpose, crystals have continued to bridge our world to the supernatural. In this class you will learn crystal basics for magical and healing purposes and discuss the impact they could have in your life and the environment around you.<\/p> <p>This class is by donation, please give what you can to cover the cost of the rental space and supplies.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Hosted by Michael Damion<\/p> <p>About Michael: I\u2019ve have been enthralled with occult practices most my life. I started when I was very young, after discovering my dreams have the tendency of coming true. This exposure to precognition is what drove my interest into the paranormal, and has continued to be a passion of mine decades later. This journey has awakened my awareness to crystal vibrations, which I train to enhance, restore, and heal my own bio-rhythm to levels of higher capacity. I would like to host this class on crystal basics to share the knowledge and experience I\u2019ve learned through my expedition into the realm of mystical arts.<\/p>",

I was there last week when The Party Factor played, I danced all night with some friends and a bunch of random people ( probably out Finding Pedro)!<\/p> <p>I am organizing this meetup here to let ya'll in on a secret, if you have never been, this place is a gem and if you have been here before going with a bunch of Pedro's Friends will be crazy fun!<\/p> <p>Cantab is not your typical \"lounge\", it does not have couches, the bartenders are swamped for the most part (they do have waitresses to bring drinks to the tables), overall decor is diveish, but the music is always top notch and the ambiance is electric especially once the crowd starts pouring in around 10:30PM. I have spent several Weekend\/Weeknights in this place just listening to music and busting some moves!<\/p> <p>THERE IS A COVER of $6.00, but its totally worth it, considering the fact that drinks are cheap!It's cash only.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Myself and possibly a few other members will wait for everyone outside the lounge and we can enter as a group , before the band starts. After the night progresses, the place will be packed, the Boston Soul Revue are playing that night starting 9:00PM <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bostonsoulrevue.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bostonsoulrevue.com\/<\/a>.<\/p> <p>There is a separate space downstairs I believe playing EDM\/HOUSE , the cover for it is generally higher, but I don't think venutring there will be a necessity.<\/p>",

Jefferson from the east, via the Great Gulf Wilderness and the Six Husbands Trail, named for Pocasset queen Weetamo's apparently less-than-lucky spouses. Ladders, scrambles and high perches have earned this trail a place on the \"Terrifying 25\" list and will make for an \u00a0entertaining ascent. After summiting Jefferson, we'll descend along the steep, scenic cascades of the Sphinx Trail.<\/p> <p><b>Scheduling Note<\/b>: This is a repost from Sunday, July 26, when the weather did not cooperate with our plans. The rain date for this posting is Sunday, August 23.<\/p> <p><b>Stats<\/b><\/p> <p>This is a strenuous hike on steep terrain.<\/p> <p>Distance: 14.6 miles\u00a0<br\/>Elevation gain: 4,804 feet\u00a0<br\/>Estimated hiking time, a.k.a. \"book\" time: 9 hours, 45 minutes. This estimate doesn't include breaks. \u00a0We might be out longer, especially given Six Husbands' jungle gym qualities.<\/p> <p>We could alter our plans because of fatigue, weather, and\/or other conditions. There is no guarantee we will complete the entire\u00a0event\u00a0as described here.<\/p> <p>No guests are permitted. No dogs are permitted because of the trail's steepness and ladders.<\/p> <p>Max group size will be 10, per wilderness area regs.<\/p> <p>We start as a group, hike as a group, and finish as a group. Our pace will be that of the slowest hiker.\u00a0This trip isn't for you if you are faster than the group and don't want to stay with us, if you want to head off on your own, or if\u00a0you expect us to constantly wait for you while you putter around.<\/p> <p><b>What to Bring<\/b><\/p> <p>The usual for a summer hike: 2-3 liters of water, lunch, snacks, rain\/wind protection, layers for cooler temps, headlamps (cuz you never know).

I have booked the room from 10am-12:30pm.<\/p> <p>Craig Forman holds advanced degrees in Electrical Engineering as well as an MBA. He has been a self-<br\/>directed investor for over 30 years, occasionally using fund managers to manage a portion of his<br\/>portfolio. After the financial meltdown of 2008, and seeing the miserable performance (relative to the<br\/>S&amp;P 500) of the managed portfolio, Craig began to educate himself on strategies to reduce risk and<br\/>increase returns by using options. After the corporation he worked for was acquired in 2009, Craig<br\/>decided to leave the corporate world to concentrate full time on trading, education, and personal<br\/>wealth management. The game changer for Craig was the launch of the tastytrade Financial Media<br\/>Network in 2011.

Have you had a desire to learn how these swords were used in combat during the Renaissance era? Much more than shouting \u201cEn Garde!\u201d and assuming a guard stance; competent warriors fought with systems that included various ways to attack and defend, footwork, timing, and even rules of dueling, all based on a sophisticated understanding of body mechanics, mathematics and philosophy.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/9\/d\/600_440793949.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The 16th century was a period of change for the sword. No longer relegated to the battlefield; the sword changed as its wear became commonplace in society. Blades slimmed and guards became more elaborate as the sword evolved into a nimble thrusting weapon worn by commoner and noble alike. As a result, a number of fencing schools opened to capitalize on their growing popularity. The golden age of rapier study dawned around 1550; numerous masters publishing fencing system manuals over the century to follow, with topics including rapier, off-hand companions such as the dagger, buckler and cape, long sword, quarterstaff, pole arm, dagger alone, and grappling.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/e\/600_440793934.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Our six-week Novice Rapier course will introduce the basic techniques and vocabulary of rapier fencing, enabling students to begin their study of period combat and the Art of Defence. The course will be taught by Charles and Robert, rapier scholars and Schole of Defence instructors.\u00a0 No prior training needed; all class equipment is provided.<\/p> <p>We invite you to come join the scholars and combatants of our Schole!<\/p> <p><i>(The price shown is for the set of all six classes [August 22, 29, and September 5, 12, 19 and, 26] and membership and registration.\u00a0 Classes are not offered separately.\u00a0 Class materials will be sent via email before the first session.)<\/i><\/p>",

Go half way around the rotary and continue onto Massapoag Ave. for three miles to the park entrance, on your left.<\/p> <p>From Boston: Take the southeast expressway south to Rte. 128 north and then to Rte. 95 south. Follow directions from above.<\/p> <p>From West: Mass Pike to Rte. 495 south to exit 10 (Easton and Rte. 123). Take a left at the end of the ramp and follow Rte. 123 east towards Easton. Rte. 123 will merge with Rte. 106 east. After this merge look for the brown \"Borderland\" sign, on the left about a half mile from the merge. Take this left onto Poquanticut Ave. After about a mile the road will fork, bear to the left onto Massapoag Ave. and follow the signs to the park, approximately another two miles. Entrance will be on your right.<\/p>",

In the summer of 2014, as a student on summer break from the Thatcher School in Ojai, California, where he set up beekeeping, Orren Fox travelled to Nepal. There, he volunteered with Maggie Doyne, whom he met in 2012 at the Do Lectures. Maggie, at age 19, began BlinkNow Foundation and the Kopila Valley Children\u2019s School. With many children living in the natural and political difficulties of Nepal, Orren taught beekeeping to all in an effort to produce local honey for the village and for its profit. Now as a high school graduate, Orren will return to Surkhet, Nepal, to continue his efforts with the Kopila Valley School and Children's Home before starting college in the fall of 2016. Here\u2019s the 100% do-good recipe: Simply buy the book, learn about bees, and help children in Nepal.

In the summer of 2014, as a student on summer break from the Thatcher School in Ojai, California, where he set up beekeeping, Orren Fox travelled to Nepal. There, he volunteered with Maggie Doyne, whom he met in 2012 at the Do Lectures. Maggie, at age 19, began BlinkNow Foundation and the Kopila Valley Children\u2019s School. With many children living in the natural and political difficulties of Nepal, Orren taught beekeeping to all in an effort to produce local honey for the village and for its profit. Now as a high school graduate, Orren will return to Surkhet, Nepal, to continue his efforts with the Kopila Valley School and Children's Home before starting college in the fall of 2016. Here\u2019s the 100% do-good recipe: Simply buy the book, learn about bees, and help children in Nepal.

Your meager beginnings will influence the paths you must take. Lead your people well and they will take you to infinite heights of greatness. If civilization manages to endure the ages, your name will hang in every whisper of its legacy...<\/p> <p>Fantasy Flight Games is excited to announce the upcoming release of\u00a0Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization: The Board Game! Forge an empire to stand the test of time using innovative game mechanics with multiple paths to victory.<\/p> <p>Will you lead the greatest army in the world to conquer your foes? Or will you be the first to journey to the stars, becoming the most technologically advanced civilization known to man? The choice is yours.<\/p> <p>Designed by Kevin Wilson,\u00a0Civilization: The Board Game\u00a0is inspired by the legendary video game series created by Sid Meier. Players are tasked with guiding an entire civilization throughout the ages, taking ownership of your people\u2019s technology, economy, culture, and military, as well as all the choices that go along with them. There are four different paths to victory, and each is riddled with opposition.<\/p> <p>In\u00a0Civilization: The Board Game, 2-5 players take on the roles of famous leaders in charge of historical civilizations, each with their own abilities. Players will be able to explore a module game board, build cities and buildings, fight battles, research powerful technology, and attract great people by advancing their culture. No matter what your play style is, there is a civilization for you!<\/p> <p>Fans of Sid Meier\u2019s classic video game franchise will find familiar footing in\u00a0Civilization: The Board Game. Staying true to the foundations of its video game predecessor while creating a new and unique way to play,\u00a0Civilization: The Board Game\u00a0captures the spirit and grandeur of carving out a magnificent empire from modest beginnings.<\/p> <p>Players start off with a single city, one army figure, and one scout, and from these meager origins you must forge through the ages and become the greatest civilization in the world.<\/p> <p>Those unfamiliar with the video game series will find\u00a0Civilization: The Board Game\u00a0a great way to enter into the world of Civilization. The strategy and tactical decisions involved in\u00a0Civilization: The Board Game\u00a0will appeal to strategy gamers and war gamers alike, and the ability to win through culture and technological advancement will give those who only wish to focus on their own empire a chance at victory as well.<\/p> <p>The\u00a0Fame and Fortune\u00a0expansion for\u00a0Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game\u00a0provides players with new game options, and brings a host of enhancements.<\/p> <p>Four new civilizations: The Arabs, the Spanish, the Greeks, and the Indians.<\/p> <p>A new deck of \"Great Person\" cards that allows players to recruit the aid of specific figures from history, such as Joan of Arc, Marco Polo, Hannibal, or Gustavus Adolphus.<\/p> <p>New map tiles, tech cards, culture event cards, and the introduction of the investment deck, which features cards that allow players to spend hard-earned coin to reap ongoing benefits.<\/p> <p>Components for a fifth player.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nWith eleven new map tiles, over 150 cards, plus more than 120 markers and tokens,\u00a0Fame and Fortune\u00a0offers a remarkable set of engaging new options to guide your people to greatness!<\/p> <p>In\u00a0Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game - Wisdom and Warfare, six new civilizations join in the battle for supremacy: Aztecs, English, French, Japanese, Mongols, and Zulu \u2013 each with its own special powers. Along with the new civilizations comes new technologies, relics, wonders, and culture cards.<\/p> <p>An alternative set of combat cards in which each unit now has separate Strength and Health values is provided for more tactical battles. With these new cards, a battle's winner is determined by comparing the total health minus the wounds of each side, plus any combat bonuses. Even if you can't completely kill a unit, damaging it will still have an effect on future turns.<\/p> <p>Wisdom and Warfare\u00a0also provides the rules for a new city action, \"Starting a Building Program\", which is a power-up for when that city produces something. This expansion also includes Social Policies that civilizations can adopt, such as \"Rationalism\" and \"Organized Religion\", and these policies offer options and provide bonuses for long-term planning.<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there!<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>To celebrate what would have been his 125th birthday, the Brattle Theater in Cambridge will be showing a series of films in honor of writer H.P. Lovecraft. While not direct adaptations, both of these movies owe quite a bit to Lovecraft's pulp stories of horror and sci-fi.<\/p> <p>In director Guillermo del Toro's \"Hellboy,\" Ron Perlman's demonic title character attempts to stop a madman and his followers from unleashing cosmic creatures into our world. Creatures, by the way, who don't seem all too different from Lovecraft's Old Ones.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=557Qpie_KWk\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=557Qpie_KWk<\/a><\/p> <p>\"Hellboy\" is then followed by John Carpenter's \"The Thing,\" one of the most beloved movies in Carpenter's filmography and one of the few times a remake has surpassed the original version. Watch as Kurt Russell's MacReady and a team of Antarctic researchers are tormented by a constantly shapeshifting alien parasite. Lovecraft's protagonists would often deal with horror that was called \"indescribable,\" and that's the best word to use regarding Rob Bottin's special effects work here. Well, that or freakin' awesome!<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VnGBL-qrmvE\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VnGBL-qrmvE<\/a><\/p> <p>So the double feature starts at 12:45 PM on August 22nd. The plan is to be at the theater 15 minutes before the movies start, which will give us time to get tickets, snacks, and find our seats. If you have never been to the Brattle before, directions by car or public transportation are listed below.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.brattlefilm.org\/about-2\/directions-parking\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.brattlefilm.org\/about-2\/directions-parking\/<\/a><\/p> <p>UPDATES<\/p> <p>I wanted to add a few additional bits of information before Saturday's Meetup happens. I plan to be outside the Brattle around 12:20 PM with a Meetup sign and my Christopher Lee T-shirt on. If you see the sign, come on over and say \"Hi!\" I would like to meet as many of the group as possible before the movies start.<\/p> <p>Sitting down for two whole movies is a long stretch of time. I figure everyone will be hungry afterwards. So when\u00a0\"The Thing\" wraps, the group can assemble outside the front of the Brattle and we can either try Shake Shack or Border Cafe for food and a chance to chat some more about the movies we saw.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.shakeshack.com\/location\/harvard-square\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.shakeshack.com\/location\/harvard-square\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.shakeshack.com\/location\/harvard-square\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bordercafe.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bordercafe.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bordercafe.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Any questions regarding this Meetup, feel free to either email me or mention it in the comments section.\u00a0Looking forward to seeing everyone on Saturday!\u00a0<\/p>",

Peace is an active\u00a0consciousness that we can learn to enter into,\u00a0enriching our individual lives, our social situations and the world at large.\u00a0<\/p> <p>During this evening, we will practice discovering the peace that is always present within us -- no matter what else is going on inside us or outside us in the world. \u00a0 As we practice recognizing our inner core of peace, we become increasingly able to choose to live in that consciousness of inner peace, even at difficult times of our lives.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will look at where we unconsciously practice \"against-ness\", and learn to let go of that feeling of against-ness, to better work with reality and with the people who surround us. As we let go of \"against-ness\", we also let go of the upset feelings, prejudices, judgments, tenseness, etc.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This meeting is sponsored by the Institute of Individual and World Peace (www.iiwp.org)<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/f\/9\/0\/600_353476272.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>To Prepare ....<\/b><\/p> <p>1) When do you feel \"against-ness\"?\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>2) What are the physical signs of your against-ness?

One can not fight for peace. If we are going to be a conduit for peace, we must start with ourselves and be in peace. Peace is defined as the absence of againstness.

I am opening my art studio at the the Boston Center for the Arts just for you so you can discover how to take better macro photos.<\/p> <p>This is a rain or shine event. We will work inside my studio building and if weather permits we will have an exercise out in the South End.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/1\/6\/600_433592534.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>If you have a macro lens, this is the perfect time to break it out and really learn how to use it to full advantage. If you don't have a macro lens fear not! You can use the close up\/flower setting on your camera.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Before you can really connect, you need to shift into a more contemplative mindset. I will guide you through some simple mindfulness exercises you can use anytime any where to help you slow down and be more present. These simple techniques will immediately open your eyes to more subtle qualities of <b>color, light, texture and shape<\/b> that usually go unnoticed. Macro requires patience and deep seeing.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/6\/0\/2\/600_129458402.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Bokeh Technique: Japanese aesthetic of blurring the background so your subject captivates our attention and appreciation.

Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.<\/p> <p>Forbidden Stars\u00a0challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same \u2013 to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.<\/p> <p>If you are new to the game and want an overview of it to make teaching go smoother I have linked the Miami Dice review below. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aZBrPHjtB-c\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aZBrPHjtB-c\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aZBrPHjtB-c<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\nHope to start shortly after my game of Civilisations is complete.<\/p>",

Berlin, 1945: Nelly (Nina Hoss,\u00a0A Most Wanted Man), a German-Jewish, ex-nightclub singer, has survived a concentration camp. But, like her country, she is scarred, her face disfigured by a bullet wound. After undergoing reconstructive surgery, Nelly emerges with a new face, one similar but different enough that her former husband, Johnny (Ronald Zehrfeld), doesn\u2019t recognize her. Rather than reveal herself, Nelly walks into a dangerous game of duplicity and disguise as she tries to figure out if the man she loves may have been the one who betrayed her to the Nazis. Submerged in shadowy atmosphere and the haunted mood of post-war Berlin, Phoenix weaves a complex, Hitchcockian tale of a nation\u2019s tragedy and a woman\u2019s search for answers as it builds towards an unforgettable, heart-stopping climax. (Partially subtitled)<\/p> <p>Following the film, we'll attempt to have a quiet discussion on the CBC patio<\/p> <p>See you at the movie,<\/p> <p>John<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>CLOSED<\/p> <p>Ahh, Malbec!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Rich, generous, dark, BIG bold red wine. Malbec is very popular these days and deservedly so.<\/p> <p>Most of what we find on the US market is from Argentina, and indeed many fine producers are from the Mendoza region in Argentina. But the varietal is French (!), traditionally grown in Cahors, a story book\u00a0provincial\u00a0town encircled by the Lot River\u00a0north of Toulouse. And believe it or not I only recently learned that the Malbec varietal was once a minor component of the standard Bordeaux blend!<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/3\/7\/8\/600_440145944.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>And what does one pair with such a rich red! Beef of course, preferably grilled. The wine lovers of Mendoza have \u00a0raised this pairing to an art form, seemingly eating beef for every meal. We will do our best to match their exuberance using the grilling resources at the venue and the grilling skills of our members.<\/p> <p><br\/>This event will be a blind tasting, a bit more formal than some of our recent events. Anh and I are in the process of selecting several wines from the new and old worlds with price points ranging from $15-40. As we did on our 2014 France tour, we will taste the wines with and without food. Whom ever identifies all wines during the tasting will win a fantastic plastic trophy! Wow!? The results promise to be full of a surprises!<\/p> <p><b><i>COST<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>$25 for wine due with RSVP\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Usual BostonWine refund policy applies. I will refund 100% up to 1 day in advance of the event. After that time, no refund.\u00a0We are now using Meetup's payment service WePay.

See below for a description of the movie\/documentary. It got great reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. It's debuting this weekend in Boston Common's theaters for a limited run.<\/p> <p><br\/>We will see the 9:25 pm show.<\/p> <p><br\/>This RSVP is for both dinner and movie unless you indicate otherwise when you RSVP.<\/p> <p><br\/>As always please remember to update your RSVP if your plans change. And try to avoid last minute drop outs. We appreciate your cooperation.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Here is a description about the movie. <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>In February 2013, Ana\u00efs Bordier, a French fashion student living in London, stumbled upon a YouTube video featuring Samantha Futerman, an actress in Los Angeles, and was struck by their uncanny resemblance. After discovering they were born on the same day in Busan, Korea and both put up for adoption, Ana\u00efs reached out to Samantha via Facebook.<\/p> <p><br\/>In Twinsters, we follow Samantha and Ana\u00efs' journey into sisterhood, witnessing everything from their first meeting, to their first trip back to Korea where their separation took place. Twinsters explores the meaning of family and connection through a story that would have been impossible just ten years ago without the creation of YouTube and Facebook.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>I volunteer a couple of times a month serving lunch at the shelter. Great group of men and women who have served our country and have come back needing a little help. The Center, which was started by a Veteran, provides housing, health care, social services, food, as well as a multitude of other services for our returning heroes. They have volunteer groups come in on weekends and do breakfast service. We don't provide the food, just smiles and friendly faces. The serving starts at 7:15am and we would be done by around 9.\u00a0 We have gone as a group several times and hope to keep this up monthly, there's a limit to 6 servers each time. It's really a wonderful time. Some of the ladies asked about baking\/bringing something. I also spoke with the head of the kitchen....just avoid things with nuts because of allergies. Hope to see you all then! We can carpool, it's near the Orange line and if you drive in you can park right in front. Also remember a hat, you need to have your head\/hair covered to serve.<\/p> <p>\u00a0My telephone number if you have any questions or have a last minute change to status is[masked]<\/p> <p>2 things:<br\/>1. Since this is a popular event, I'd like to ask that you only sign up only if you are able to get up early on a Sunday.\u00a0 There will be several Sundays throughout the year I'll actually take myself off as well so that opens up one spot. On the days I cook, I'll also open it up to have 7 servers so that more can come.<br\/>2. To prevent the # of no shows we've had, I'm going to just let everyone know that if you know show, I will remove you from future volunteer opportunities with the Center. I've hated the times when due to no shows, the Vets have had to step in to help, especially because there are often individuals that were on the wait list and didn't have the opportunity to show. If you cannot attend, please RSVP no ahead of time, or at the very least, just call or text me if you aren't well the morning of the shift, just so I know and can get them to provide help when I get there. My telephone # is[masked]-1526. Those letting me know that they can't make a day ahead of time won't be considered a no show.<\/p> <p>Thank you for your ongoing support. I appreciate it and I know that the Veterans do as well.<\/p>",

More than ten thousand years before those Europeans arrived, Native Americans made their home in the hills. The Natives referred to themselves as Massachusett, or \"people of the great hills\".

        "description": "<p>This venue honors Charles River Boating as well as Boating in Boston season passes. \u00a0Some may have purchased groupons or living social coupons for either of these places.<\/p> <p>We'll paddle the waters of Boston Harbor at Carson Beach which can be reached by Red Line or car. <b>Please bring cash.<\/b> We'll learn the basics on shore then plan to put them in the water for 1 to 1.5 hour which is plenty of time for a workout and to learn all you need to know.\u00a0If you already know how to kayak, you are welcome to join us too. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>After we kayak, we can relax on the beach, walk. \u00a0Also, there is a fast take-out place at Castle Island (about a 25-30 minute walk) where you can get food and \u00a0or ice cream). \u00a0Food served at a reasonable price include hot dogs, hamburgers, fish, fries, onion rings... \u00a0There are bathrooms\/changing areas available on the beach.<\/p> <p><b>Park in the Carson Beach Lot or on Babe Ruth Avenue or take the Red Line (best way) to JFK and walk 9 minutes to McCormick Bathhouse, Carson Beach, South Boston.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>If there is a wait for kayaks, some will start kayaking while others watch from the beach or walk Castle Island. Then, the second group will go out while the first group watches or walks. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Single kayaks are $15\/hour; tandems are \u00a0$20. \u00a0We may have to take tandems if there are no more singles available.<\/p> <p>If you have any questions, \u00a0can post in comment section.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/0\/4\/600_398359972.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Kayaking is easier than canoeing and much safer than it has been in the past. Wearing a rubber skirt and rolling the kayak is no longer required.<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/boatinginboston.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/boatinginboston.com\/<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/2\/0\/600_398776672.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We'll meet at these tables (see photo above) which is across from Boating in Boston where we rent kayaks in the brick building below (McCormick Bathhouse).\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/4\/e\/0\/600_398777632.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Carson Beach<\/b><\/p> <p>This sandy beach, owned and maintained by the Commonwealth's Department of Conservation and Recreation, is one of the best swimming beaches in the area, with nearby public amenities and great views of the Harbor. New sand, new walkways, benches, lighting, shade shelters and award winning landscaping have helped to make Carson Beach a popular destination. The recently renovated Edward J. McCormack Bathhouse, one of the first facilities completed as part of the \"Back to the Beaches\" effort, has restrooms, changing rooms, showers, drinking water fountains, chess tables, and bocce courts. In addition, it hosts first aid and lifeguard functions. \"Mother's Rest\" and its fishing pier have also been rehabilitated, making for a beautiful picnic area with a fantastic view of the Harbor.<\/p> <p><b>HOW TO KAYAK<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>STEP 1 Gear up<\/p> <p>Choose a kayak suited for learning. A sit-on-top model is best for beginners and what we'll be using. Wear a life jacket.<\/p> <p>STEP 2 Get in<\/p> <p><br\/>Step into the kayak, crouching to keep your center of gravity low, and quickly sit down. On a beach, lay the paddle across the cockpit and rest one end on the sand to steady the boat as you get in.<\/p> <p>Lean back comfortably in the seat as you paddle. This will help the boat stay stable.<\/p> <p>STEP 3 Paddle<\/p> <p>Hold the paddle with an overhand grip, thumbs under, and dip one side into the water. Pull down and back with one hand while pushing forward with the other hand. Dip the paddle straight in and pull it back even with your hips. Then dip the other side.<\/p> <p>Paddle with a smooth, rhythmic motion. Use your torso muscles and sit up straight without leaning into your strokes.<\/p> <p>STEP 4 Turn<\/p> <p>Paddle on only one side to turn the kayak in an opposite direction. Or use the paddle like a rudder, dragging it on the side you want to turn toward.<\/p> <p>STEP 5 Practice falling out or turning the kayak over in water<\/p> <p>Strap the paddle to a kayak, then grab the middle of the kayak. Kick to pull yourself onto a sit-on model, which are the easy ones we'll be using.<\/p> <p>STEP 6 Watch conditions<\/p> <p>Be aware of water and weather conditions. Paddle at an angle to the wind until you're near the shore before continuing.<\/p> <p>STEP 7 Know the rules and your limits<\/p> <p>Learn the rules that determine right-of-way on the water. Give the\u00a0right of way\u00a0to less maneuverable watercraft.<\/p> <p>STEP 8 Get out.<\/p> <p>Use your balance and take your time.<\/p> <p>Remember: Your Event Organizers are volunteers.

Short ride passes through Dover, Sherborn, and Holliston. Long ride extends to Ashland. We'll pass by several farms in the area (may see some Llamas, Burros, and Horses in addition to the usual farm animals). Short ride varies from flat to medium hills. Long ride adds hills in Holliston. LUNCH stop for all rides is in Holliston at the Coffee Haven\u00a0<\/p> <p>This is the arrow to follow for the ride:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.crw.org\/cuesheets\/arrows\/ApplePiArrow.gif\" \/><\/p> <p>This is a re-occuring ride every Sunday beginning in April, with the organized and marked rides of CRW (Charles River Wheelmen). The picture above is from one of last years rides. Don't let the # of RSVPs here fool you, these rides are always well atended usually with over 25 riders of all abilities.<\/p> <p>The distances\u00a0and routes vary every week. We'll have \"No Drop Rule\" so you won't have to worry about getting lost or keeping up. Ride with us if you ride anywhere from 15 to 20 MPH.<\/p> <p>Always bring two spare tubes, and your preferred hydration and nutrition. We don't typically stop for lunch but depending on the ride, there are sometimes options to stop for a bit. Before riding it's good practice to get your bike tuned. Remember to dress for the elements.<\/p> <p>Also CRW organizes a <a href=\"http:\/\/crw.org\/century.php?event=s\">Spring Century<\/a>, a Summer Century called <a href=\"http:\/\/crw.org\/CTTC\/climb2clouds.php\">Climb to the Clouds<\/a>, and a <a href=\"http:\/\/crw.org\/century.php?event=f\">Fall Century<\/a>. All of the Centuries have organized food and water stops. I'm hoping to get a group committed to building up to these Century rides.<\/p>",

Starting at the Framingham High School parking lot, we will ride about 30 miles round trip to Trombatta Farms for ice cream. While this is a no person left behind ride, please be sure you can maintain at least 12 - 13 mph average speed on rolling hills of Boston's western suburbs. We will stop and regroup at major turns.<\/p> <p><br\/>What you need: a helmet, spare tube, 1 - 2 water bottles, and a sense of fun and adventure. No ear buds or headphones please. I cannot say if they sell lunch food at Trombetta Farms, but can confirm that they have ice cream, so if you think this is more than sufficient as a nutritious and satisfying lunch, then you're all set (really, ice cream is a complete food!). Otherwise, you might want to bring something with you to eat at lunch.<\/p> <p>Arrive at 10am at Framingham High School parking lot for a 10:15am departure.

Each part lasts approximately 30 minutes.<\/p> <p>The Healing Service gives you the opportunity to receive healing energy that is channeled through one of our Healers. We believe that healing can be channeled through thought to those who need it. This is a very calming experience, whether or not you choose to sit in a healing chair.\u00a0 We encourage you to send healing to your loved ones, our communities, and Mother Earth.<\/p> <p>The Lecture covers a variety of topics ranging from the History of Spiritualism to Inspired Insights. It also includes examples of how Spiritualism is a part of our lives on a daily basis.<\/p> <p>Mediumship, or Spirit Communication, is the part of the service where a medium proves that \"...the existence and personal identity of the individual continue after the change called death.\" The medium might be a member of our church or visiting from another the Spiritualist church in the community. We also have mediums from abroad stop in often. While there is only enough time during a service for a few people to receive messages from their deceased loved ones on the Higher side Side of Life, everyone present benefits by witnessing proof of the continuation of life.<\/p> <p>At the conclusion of the service everyone is invited to our social hour downstairs for coffee and conversation.\ufeff<\/p>",

I don't want to be bored.<\/b><\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement. It's very common to in the same class have one student working on perfecting their roll, and on the other side of the room have another student practicing very high-level acrobatics. They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/b><\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous. We accept cash or card day of.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Anything else?<\/b><\/p> <p>These jams will be run outdoors, and with existing architecture. While we won't be getting into anything crazy, injuries are to be expected. Scrapes happen. We will have first aid available, but make sure you are thinking clearly and in your limits before training!\u00a0<\/p> <p>I am available to answer all questions, but I hope to see a whole bunch of you out in a few weeks!!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Be sure to check us out on:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\"><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/7\/5\/600_437965461.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

We will be somewhere inside the area shown on the map below. We will probably sit north of the gazebo. When we find a spot, Rachel will make a comment with a GPS image of the exact location.<\/p> <p>Boston Common is located right next to all of these T stops: Park Street (Red Line &amp; Green Line), Boylston (Green Line), Chinatown (Orange Line), Downtown Crossing (Red &amp; Orange)<\/p> <p>This is a potluck-style picnic, so if you can, please bring some food or (non-alcoholic) drink to share. If you have any games to play outdoors, those would be fun to bring, too! Football and frisbee were popular last time.<\/p> <p>Even if you can't bring anything, don't worry! You're still welcome to join!

A potluck will be held after the tapping circle. More tappers will join us in socializing, mingling and discussing healing and many other topics, I'm sure!<\/p> <p>Attendance is not required, you can choose to go to either one event, but keep in mind that the amount of people allowed in the tapping circle is limited to 10.

Walk down Mass Ave towards MIT, make a right on Sidney Street, and walk down about four blocks to Pacific Street. It's about a 5-10 minute walk from the T stop.<\/p> <p>Parking: There are spots on one side of Tudor Street between Sidney and Brookline that are free to park at on weekends.

Due to high demand, we are putting in place a priority rule for those who show up consistently and on time. If there is a waitlist, no-shows from the previous week get lower priority. It counts as a no-show for waitlist purposes if you change your\u00a0RSVP to \"no\" less than 24 hours before the start time or arrive late for the actual game after warm-up.<\/p>",

PLEASE look on the website each week for confirmation. THANKS!<\/p> <p><br\/>To get to the Meetup, take the RED LINE stop OUTBOUND TO ALEWIFE, and stop at PORTER SQ. Look down the street. There's Tavern in the Square! If you're driving, you can park on the street for free on Sundays!<\/p> <p>Anyone who loves ASL is welcome to come and be part of the fun! We want to warmly extend an invitation to Deaf people or others fluent\/skilled in the language (CODAs for example) to join our group.<\/p> <p>This is an easy-going, casual, ASL get-together to meet people who enjoy American Sign Language, who want to brush up on their signing skills, and want to learn more ASL by using it as often as possible.<\/p> <p>We strive to have a good time and communicate without using voices. If we need to, we draw or write what we don't know how to sign, and if lots of folks show up, we split up into small groups and mix and mingle, so we can actually see one another clearly, face-to-face and get a good conversation going.<\/p> <p>Don't be afraid or shy if you're not \"perfect\" at ASL, because being \"perfect\" is not the point of this group. No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.<\/p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again. This isn't an ASL class, since none of us are certified ASL teachers, so there's really <i>no<\/i> pressure or expectation--other than that we all use ASL to communicate. We all learn from one another!<\/p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL\/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language<\/i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs<\/i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!<\/p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged<\/i><\/b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating. We have lots of resources that we can suggest for learning ASL from a qualified teacher or authentic source, such as books, online classes, and local classes at various locations near Boston.<\/p> <p>If you can, \"officially\" RSVP, even if the RSVP is \"No,\" so that we know who is definitely going to come.<\/p> <p>It will be great to see folks!<\/p> <p>Erika and Jack<\/p>",

Take the 73 ~2 miles and get off at Oxford street or Marian street. Exact address will be posted prior to meetup.\u00a0<\/p> <p>PLEASE un-RSVP if you can\u2019t make it. It\u2019s pretty rude to say you are coming and not show up.<\/p> <p>Address is 68 Dartmouth St #3 in Belmont. If you need to reach me call[masked]<\/p>",

        "description": "<p><b>We had a pretty good game of Successors last weekend, and I feel like I want to take it on the road again while the rules are fresh in my head. Both veterans and total newbies are welcome to try this out -- it's a fun, lively multi-player game with a lot of nastiness and treachery to go around.<\/b><\/p> <p>Babylon. 323 BC.<\/p> <p>The mighty emperor Alexander the Great, fresh off of conquering Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, Syria, Persia and Egypt, and spreading Hellenistic civilization to the four quarters of his realm, sits down, gets his drink on, and dies around two weeks later.<\/p> <p>Bummer.<\/p> <p>Double bummer is that our man Alex, still being quite the young fellow, did not leave an heir who was of age. The theory is that his generals will loyally keep the peace and protect his heirs and other family members until they are old enough to take the reins of his vast empire, and CERTAINLY NOT try to carve off a mighty kingdom of their very own from some choice bits that just happen to be exactly where their loyal troops just happen to be standing.<\/p> <p>That's the theory. History teaches how well this theory usually works in practice.<\/p> <p>In Successors, you control two of those generals, and you have a choice: you can be a loyal champion of the late emperor's family and gain Legitimacy Points by protecting the young heirs and carrying Alexander's funeral cart from Babylon back to the Macedonian capital city, Pella, or you can stake out a position as a successor to Alexander's throne (by right of We Can Beat You Up) by gaining control of provinces and claiming Victory Points. You can win instantly by passing a VP or LP threshold, you can win by controlling one of the heirs at the start of the appropriate turn AND having the most VP and LP combined, or you can win at the end of five turns by having the most VP.<\/p> <p>To me, this sounds like Game of Thrones with fewer nude scenes but better hummous. Does it sound good to you? Let's play.<\/p> <p>We'll be meeting at Pandemonium for this one. It's two blocks from the Central Square Red Line stop. The Open Gaming begins at Pandemonium at 6 but I'd like to get there a little early (this hasn't historically been an issue, most of the time) to aid in teaching the game with enough time left over to play the thing, so please shoot for 5:30 if at all possible.<\/p>",

Frequently, 20-25 walkers turn out for this walk, and you can too. There are a whole bunch of regulars, along with some new people.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nWe'll go out to dinner at a local pub or chinese restaurant - you can get a decent dinner for under $10.<\/p> <p>Frequently, if we eat too much food, we'll go for another walk.<\/p> <p>Come see why this walk is so popular. It's at a great time, the people are friendly, the parking is free -- no permit parking in Cambridge on Sunday, so you can park on Huron or Aberdeen Ave.<\/p> <p>You can get there by T easily from Harvard Square, take the 71 OR 73 bus to Aberdeen Ave, then walk to the other end of Aberdeen Ave, and you'll see us there. We'll be next to the bridge, on the pond side of Huron Ave,at the intersection of Aberdeen Ave.<\/p> <p>If you're late, and we've already started, start walking counter-clockwise. We'll be walking clockwise, so we'll surely bump into each other. We're the large group of vigorously chatting walkers.<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nShangri La is located at 149 Belmont Street, Belmont - please let the host know if you're coming, so we can get the right sized table.\u00a0<\/p>",

The weight is the result of the problem, it isn't the problem in and of itself--although weight certainly is <i>a<\/i> problem!<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This movie addresses this directly and indirectly, and we will have a discussion following the movie.<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Here is a trailer:\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt1567233\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt1567233\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt1567233\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 People who RSVP yes will receive my address and phone number the day before the event. If you say \"yes\", and your plans change, kindly update so someone else may attend.<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If you wind up on the wait list, remember, there are always last-minute changes, and you may well be able to attend.<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also, if Sundays don't work for you, let me know what day would be better, for future scheduling.\u00a0 I'm available Mondays and Wednesdays during the week.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 See you then!<\/p> <p>Al<\/p>",

She was a poor\u00a0black tobacco farmer whose cells\u2014taken without her knowledge in 1951\u2014became one of the most important tools in medicine, vital for developing the polio vaccine, cloning, gene mapping, and more.\u00a0Henrietta's cells\u00a0have been bought and sold by the billions, yet\u00a0she remains virtually unknown, and her family can't afford health insurance. This phenomenal New York Times bestseller tells a riveting story of the collision between ethics, race, and medicine; of scientific discovery and faith healing; and of a daughter consumed with questions about the mother she never knew.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>While it's fairly short notice, only a couple weeks to get this one read, it is a pretty fast moving, easy read so hopefully we'll all be able to get at least mostly through it.\u00a0 And no matter what, there will be plenty of good food, good wine and even better company.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

Walk from the parking lot along the main dike (between the two impoundments). We'll meet at the platform halfway down the dike on the right. If the refuge lowers the water in one of the impoundments, we'll scan the lower pool for shorebirds. We also will watch for herons, egrets, wood ducks, etc. as they settle in for their evening roost. Last year, several of us stayed past dark to hear both Great Horned Owl and Eastern Screech Owls calling from the woods across the lower impoundment. Insect repellent helpful, particularly once the sun sets. 5:30-7:00 PM. Janet Kovner<\/p>",

Growing up in the North End, then a teeming multicultural neighborhood, Addie\u2019s intelligence and curiosity take her to a world her parents can\u2019t imagine\u2014a world of short skirts, movies, celebrity culture, and new opportunities for women. Addie wants to finish high school and dreams of going to college. She wants a career and to find true love.<\/p> <p>Eighty-five-year-old Addie tells the story of her life to her twenty-two-year-old granddaughter, who has asked her \u201cHow did you get to be the woman you are today.\u201d She begins in 1915, the year she found her voice and made friends who would help shape the course of her life. From the one-room tenement apartment she shared with her parents and two sisters, to the library group for girls she joins at a neighborhood settlement house, to her first, disastrous love affair, Addie recalls her adventures with compassion for the na\u00efve girl she was and a wicked sense of humor.<\/p> <p>Written with the same attention to historical detail and emotional resonance that made Anita Diamant\u2019s previous novels bestsellers, <i>The<\/i> <i>Boston Girl<\/i> is a moving portrait of one woman\u2019s complicated life in twentieth century America, and a fascinating look at a generation of women finding their places in a changing world.<\/p>",

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>NUTSHELL - every week\u00a0day, 12:15ish until 1:45ish,\u00a0Cumnock Turf Fields\u00a0at Harvard Stadium, games of 4v4 up to 10v10 or larger depending on who shows, bring a white shirt and a dark\/colored shirt (but not a gray one), almost never canceled, read\u00a0below for more details before asking questions that are answered here, and read the comments for today's meetup to see if there is\u00a0anything important\u00a0about today.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\"><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT - Harvard Square is the closest T stop (red line). \u00a0Check Google Maps or other to find fastest way there from wherever you are.<\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY RIDE SHARE - a lot of players in this meetup come by car and are nice enough to offer rides to others. Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>",

Today, in response to huge community interest and to draw diverse Boston residents into the park, the Franklin Park Coalition has revived the Playhouse. For the last seven years, the City of Boston's portable ParkARTS stage has been brought to the park for concerts, theatre, and dance performances. This ambitious summer arts series has been possible with the involvement of experienced partners: the National Center of Afro-American Artists, First Night Boston's Summer Beat, and ParkARTS. You can look forward to summer concerts every Tuesday morning and evening throughout July and August. Morning shows target summer camps and youth programs but also bring elder groups to the park. All are invited to bring a picnic lunch and stay for the day. FPC's Summer Youth Crew members help direct groups to the site, show them a picnic spot, and can be available to play games or lead a walk in the woods after the show. Evening concerts are for everyone. Families bring a picnic basket and lawn chairs. Neighbors and friends make it a social evening. Performers are local favorites like Ray Greene, Fulani Haynes, Andre Ward, and Valerie Stephens. Playhouse Revival Elma Lewis was adamant that if the performance area is revitalized in her name, it must follow the artistic vision and standards of the original Playhouse in the Park. Ms. Lewis worked tirelessly to ensure that African-American children and community members receive disciplined, skilled artistic training and exposure to the most talented musicians and performers of the day. To carry on in her footsteps, Playhouse in the Park has been re-established as an exciting summer venue for multi-cultural performances. The first summers included gospel concerts, Commonwealth Shakespeare\u2019s A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, children\u2019s performances for summer camp groups, and theatre workshops for youth directed by Our Place Theatre in Roxbury. The Playhouse in the Park is a cultural partnership between the Franklin Park Coalition, the National Center of Afro-American Artists, and the Boston Parks &amp; Recreation Department. First Night Boston's Summer Beat produces the summer season, which includes five or more Tuesdays with a morning children's event and an evening show for everyone. The 2009 Playhouse summer season was made possible with generous support from ParkARTS, the Boston Foundation, and an anonymous donor and many individual contributors to the Franklin Park Coalition. An exciting 2010 season with daytime and evening Tuesday performances is planned. Today, a playhouse stage is brought in for performances and set up near the Overlook ruins. The Coalition would like to return the Playhouse stage to the scenic ruins Miss Lewis used. Summer arts programming, combined with masonry and landscape restoration, will revive this long-neglected area of the park. Elma Lewis was a cultural icon in Boston's black community until her death in January 2004. She was the founder and director of The Elma Lewis School for Fine and Performing Arts in the 1950s, where thousands of African American children and adults studied until it closed in the 1980s. Miss Lewis, who helped start the Franklin Park Coalition, sought to make the park a community gathering place after years of neglect. Miss Lewis and a group of students cleaned up the rat-infested, garbage-strewn area where Olmsted's Overlook Shelter had burned. They built the Playhouse stage amidst the stone ruins and set up chairs. Thus began a summer concert series that took place every night from July 4th to Labor Day for twelve years. Local performers and national stars graced the Playhouse stage, offering drama, dance, music and poetry, all of the high caliber that Miss Lewis demanded. From Duke Ellington's 4th of July concerts to Olatunji and his African drums closing the season on Labor Day, from Billy Taylor and Odetta to the Boston Ballet, people in Boston were exposed to premier arts.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>They were America's longest lasting dynasty, the closest thing to a royal family our nation has ever known. The Adamses played a leading role in America's affairs for nearly two centuries -- from John, the self-taught lawyer who rose to the highest office in the government he helped to create; to John Quincy, the child prodigy who followed his father to the White House and fought slavery in Congress; to Charles Francis, the Civil War diplomat; to Henry, the brilliant scholar and journalist. Indeed, the history of the Adams family can be read as the history of America itself. For when the Adamses \"looked at their past, they saw the nation's,\" writes author Richard Brookhiser. \"When they looked at the nation's past, they saw themselves.\"<\/p> <p><i>America's First Dynasty<\/i> charts the family's travels through American history along with an impressive cast of characters, among them George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Ulysses S. Grant, and Theodore Roosevelt. Brookhiser also details the darker side of the Adams experience, from the specters of alcoholism and suicide to the crushing burden of performance passed on from father to son. Yet by putting a human face on this legendary family, Brookhiser succeeds in creating an impassioned, heroic family portrait that the American public is not likely to forget.<\/p>",

These are full-portion sized appetizers for real cheap! If not, you'll still be able to take advantage of the monthly specials.<\/p> <p>HOW TO GET THERE<\/p> <p>This location is easily accessible from Rt. 16, Rt. 28 and Rt. 93, and is walking distance from the T, near the new Station Landing apartment complex. Here is a map of the area.<\/p> <p>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p> <p>See you there!!<\/p>",

Well now you can have all of those things at the best <i>Track workout<\/i> ever.<\/p> <p>Interest peaked?

Skip it if you would rather just wing it and meet us at the track. We'll fill you in there.<\/p> <p>If you have never run on a track before, don't worry if none of this makes sense right now. As much as I will try to prep you, it usually just takes a few laps around the track for all of this to sink in.<\/p> <p><b>The Workout<\/b><\/p> <p>The workouts vary on a weekly basis and are usually interval based. We sometimes do workouts that are fun and different. Come see what this weeks workout is!<\/p> <p><b>What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>1. The distances (200, 400, 800, etc.) are the distances we run on the track. Each lap around the track is 400 meters.<\/p> <p>2. Each lap is supposed to be run at a certain speed, based on your 5k pace. Don't know what your 5k pace is? Read my instructions below to calculate your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>*3. The recovery interval (RI), which is indicated in parentheses, may be a specified timed interval or a distance that you walk\/jog.<\/p> <p><b>Things to remember<\/b><\/p> <p>Track workouts are supposed to be FUN! Don't be intimidated or dread a track workout. This is supposed to be a fun supplement to your other \"normal\" runs. With all of us out there encouraging each other it should be a blast.<\/p> <p>Bring a running stopwatch\/wristwatch if you have one! Using the start\/lap\/stop function will help you pace yourself on each lap.<\/p> <p>Don't push it! If something hurts or starts to feel tight, don't risk an injury because you ran too hard on your first track workout of the summer. We have plenty of time to ease in...<\/p> <p>Bring water for the end!!!<\/p> <p><b>5k pace instructions<\/b><\/p> <p>Decide how fast you would like to run a 5k. Choose a time that is reasonable yet challenging. Convert that time to seconds, and divide the seconds by 12.5 (the number of 400 meter laps it takes to run 5k). That is your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>As an example, I might decide a reasonable yet challenging goal time for a 5k is 24 minutes.<\/p> <p>24 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 1440 seconds<\/p> <p>1440 seconds divided by 12.5 laps in a 5k ~= 115 seconds \/ lap<\/p> <p>This means that I will run the workout according to a pace of 115 seconds \/ lap.<\/p> <p>I will also have pacing charts available at the track, so don't fret.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.informalrunning.com\/category\/blog\/\">Blog<\/a><\/b><\/p>",

We regularly run three to five tables of board games - this provides enough variety. \u00a0It is normal for people to get two or three games a session. \u00a0The game night format was inspired by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.unitygames.org\/\">Unity Games<\/a>\u00a0and the event is very casual and structureless. \u00a0If you have gone to one of the meetup's quarterly events you will know.<\/p> <p><b>Q &amp; A:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Q. \u00a0What types of games are played?<\/b><br\/>A. \u00a0Any type of board game. \u00a0Browse through the most popular games at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/<\/a><\/a> and that should give you an idea.<\/p> <p><b>Q. \u00a0Until when do you play games? \u00a0Can I arrive later than 7pm?<\/b><br\/>A. \u00a0Until the last game of the evening ends, usually past midnight. \u00a0Yes, you can arrive later than 7pm, but you may have to wait for a new game to start if you do.<\/p> <p><b>Q. \u00a0Should I bring something?\u00a0\u00a0<\/b><br\/>A. \u00a0If you want, bring a game you feel comfortable teaching. There will be pizza and sodas served. Feel free to bring snacks or beverages to share or chip in $5 to $10 for the pizza\/sodas in the pizza cup.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Q. \u00a0I really want to play XYZ game, can we schedule it?<\/b><br\/>A. \u00a0Some people ask for interest in a particular game on the event comments below. \u00a0This may be the way to make sure you get to play the game you want.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Q. \u00a0Where do I park?<\/b><br\/>A. \u00a0The driveway is the obvious spot, but eventually it will fill up on most of these game nights. \u00a0Some people do park on the street. \u00a0The soccer field parking across the street is a safe option and is the suggestion the town police gave me when I asked about overflow parking.<\/p>",
        "how_to_find_us": "The house is just across from a soccer field.  If the driveway starts to fill up, the soccer field parking lot is a good option.",
