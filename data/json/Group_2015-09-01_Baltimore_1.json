Whether you're new to DC, have primarily guy friends or are looking to branch out, this is a group for women in their 20-somethings who are interested in exploring DC, grabbing drinks or meals or just hanging out. I started this group for all of the reasons above, but I also miss having great girlfriends during college and I'm hoping to make those kind of meaningful connections out here. Plus, I love meeting new people and think this is a great way to do so. Looking forward to meeting some awesome ladies and finding new favorite places!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Fees: We put fees in place to cover the meet up costs (They now charge us $90 twice a year to keep this group running...) and the times - although rarer and rarer - that we get stuck with the bill after a night out. Meet up also takes a cut of the annual dues you pay, so we only get a portion of THAT. I know, crazy. So thanks for understanding and joining the group! It's been wonderful and successful since day 1!<\/span><\/p>",

Theta Healing is about clearing the blocks, programs, fears, and limiting beliefs from our electromagnetic energy fields. As a result, we are able to align with the heart and stand in our truth. This facilitates deep healing on all levels. and gives us instant ability to manifest what we want in our lives on all levels. Theta Healing activates dormant DNA in the body. This is huge because it allows us to ascend into the 4th dimension and create our own realities everyday!!!<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>A social community centered around cooking and conversations, where friends and soon-to-be friends cook and talk together while enjoying tasty dishes. How it works. Bring the ingredients necessary for everyone to try a little bit of your dish, grill, extra knives &amp; cutting boards (if you have them) and a bottle of wine per person. When you arrive 1) Check in 3) Pour yourself some wine 4) Start making your dish 5) Drink some more wine 6) Help your new friends 7) Bang on a pot when your dish is finished 8) Don't forgot....try some dishes, share your dish, and try not to start yourself on fire 9) Wrap up some food to take home 10) Everyone helps clean up This has been an incredible success, cultivating some of the best vibes we've felt in a while. We started at 18 people and pushed the chaos to 60, which somehow still works. Some dish ideas of what was made in the past; Vietnamese Summer Rolls, Gazpacho, Watermelon Basil Mint Feta Salad, Week-long marinated Pork, Portobello Mushroom Burgers, Curried Squash Soup, etc.<\/p>",

I don't want to scare away non Whedon fans (if there is such a thing...), but my favorite fandoms are all from him so that's where I went with the tags. But I wouldn't limit events to that one area, we can diversify! There are a ton of amazing nerdy Meetup groups, but I was hoping to make some events closer to home in Columbia, rather than Baltimore or DC. Really, all of Howard County is accessible and nice. Some events I would hope to plan (and host) would be marathon nights of favorite TV shows, happy hours, casual gaming parties, etc. I am part of another group that has amazing events (like a weekly trivia night) that would be fun to combine with as well.<\/p>",

This group is for First-Time mothers - whether you have already had your little one or if you are counting down the days till your baby's arrival. This is a special time in our lives when relationships with other women are so helpful and important. Our boyfriends and hubbies, try as they may, can provide lots of desperately needed love and support, but when it comes down to it, women need women. If you are looking for friends to share this season (whether trying or being pregnant)...you should join! If you are looking for community and encouragement in your first-time mommy-hood...you should join! If you are looking for friends to be the Village that it takes to raise wonderful healthy well-adjusted kids....YOU SHOULD JOIN!!&nbsp; Please include a brief bio about yourself, children names and ages, or expectant due date please. There is a $2 membership fee that must be paid within 30 days of joining. <br><\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>PLEASE NO SOLICITING!!<\/p>",

Well...this group can't promise to reach those heights of intellectualism. But we can at least enjoy great conversation, share what we're reading, what we're learning and expand our minds by association, ALL while enjoying a good beer or coffee at one of Baltimore's many great hangouts. I hope we can read each others' work, share our latest epiphanies and recommend our favorite books. If you are a Christian writer, thinker, philosopher, talker or listener, consider joining the group.\u00a0<span>Maybe a blurb about myself will convince you one way or the other, if we can be friends!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I'm a Christian. The mysteries of how God's redemption, our faith and the human experience intertwine is a constant source of conversation for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I like to think that I'm a film\/tv \"connoisseur\": The greatest tv shows of the last decade were Pushing Daisies and Firefly (though my brother will argue for Breaking Bad). The film I'm most looking forward to at the moment is Star Trek Into Darkness (I am an unabashed sci-fi fan).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I'm currently reading (among other things) \"'Til We Have Faces\", \"Confessions of St. Augustine\" and \"1776\". I am most inspired by allegorical storytelling. It's that experience you have when someone tells you a story, and their delivery was so good, that not until the very end did you realize they have changed your mind or altered your perception of something (like Inception!). My most recent experience of this was watching Zero Dark 30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I like coffee and beer, so coffee houses or pubs just seemed like a good meeting place :)<\/span><\/p>",

This group is inspired by the historical Loving's relationship that overcame the racial injustices of their time. Their marriage is an example of true loyalty, love, and perseverance.<\/p>\n<p>The group will explore the local Howard County area, mostly, meeting-up at museums, Jazz venues, rock concerts, bars, clubs, restaurants, happy hours, volunteer opportunities, live sporting events, wine tours, and the like.\u00a0 Socializing is a major aspect of the group, and the hope is that new friendships and social connections are forged.<\/p>\n<p>We welcome all religions: Jewish, Catholic, Christians, Protestants, etc.<\/p>\n<p>There are many other avenues to meet people of the same ethnicity; for that, we say\u2014great, join that group. We love everyone! But, this group is for professional, sincere, and single white men and single black women open to meeting one another in a social environment.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n In order to join, please show a recent picture of yourself (members want to\u00a0 see\u00a0 who you are!); honestly complete your profile and RSVP or cancel RSVP's in a timely manner. (You do not have to cancel a RSVP if you were never going to attend anyway). An annual membership to this group\u00a0costs a nominal fee of $20 upon joining. Once your membership is paid, you are a member in good standing for a year, and you are welcome to attend the many events that we have lined up!<\/p>\n<p>Looking forward to meeting you!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>",

Excel is called Excel for a reason...\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p>-Steven Bugge<\/p>\n<p>The benefit of being a member of this meetup group is improving one\u2019s knowledge of MS Excel and learning how it can be leveraged at both work and home.<\/p>\n<p>The Excel Refresher Meetup is here for beginning, intermediate and advanced users of Excel who would like to learn and share tips and tricks with fellow users. Maybe you are upgrading to Excel 2007 2010 2013, switching from PC to Mac or maybe your new to Excel all together. This is a great place to help get acquainted. Excel is an extremely dynamic and useful program and there are TONS of resources out there on the web for MS Excel, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to see the forest through the trees. Simply having someone to talk to can make all the difference and that is the purpose of this meet up.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I was told once told by a manager that \"MS Excel is a soft skill\". \u00a0Those words did not sit well with me as I tried to digest that statement while thinking back to how it was my MS Excel skills that got me hired in the first place; at every company I had\u00a0ever\u00a0worked for...<\/p>\n<p>This dichotomy eventually lead me to make the\u00a0decision\u00a0of working for myself as a data consultant,\u00a0because\u00a0what I came to realize was; it\u2019s not that MS Excel is a soft skill, it's that people's MS Excel skills are soft.<\/p>\n<p>Excel is misunderstood and therefore underutilized by many professionals. CEO\u2019s, entrepreneurs, \u00a0med students, manufacturing analysts and venture capitalists (to name a few) have all reached out to me with Excel questions and are simply blown away by what they didn\u2019t know they didn\u2019t know. I believe that an informed community is a productive one.\u00a0 When the US produces 60,000 engineers a year, and India and China produce 400,000 and 1.6 million respectively, we as a nation have a lot of catching up to do (no pressure!).<\/p>\n<p>We have to begin somewhere, of course, and I think a communal collaboration of MS Excel knowledge amongst CEO\u2019s, secretaries, professors, students, working and stay at home parents, along with everyone in between, is a damn good place to start! \u00a0(# S.T.E.M.)<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>This meetup is for people in the Silver Spring area who enjoy being outdoors and want to participate in a variety of activities. We plan outdoor activities of short duration (2-5 hours) and within an hour of Silver Spring. Examples would be biking on the C&amp;O Canal Trail, a walk along one of Montgomery County's many greenway trails\u00a0or a potluck picnic in a park. We often walk on the stream valley trails that form a network in and around Silver Spring. Members are encouraged to suggest and organize events. It is not required but helpful if you can post a photo of yourself on your profile (even better if it is outdoors).<\/p>\n<p>Some rules\/guidelines:\u00a0 Anyone over 18 can join. Children are welcome as a guest of a member as long as they are supervised and can keep up with the described activity. Dogs are welcome as long as they are friendly, leashed, you pick up after them and they are allowed in the area where we will be. If you have any questions about an event after reading the description, please e-mail the event organizer or post a comment.<\/p>\n<p>You are a no show if you have signed up to attend an event (RSVP'd yes) and do not attend. If you change your RSVP at the last minute or e-mail me or the event organizer to say you're not coming that does not count as a no show. Even an explanation after the fact may mean your absence does not count as a no show. After three no shows I will remove you from the group and you will not be able to rejoin.<\/p>\n<p>Dues for this meet-up in 2015 will be $5. Any member who hosts a meet-up event will automatically be exempt from dues for a year. If you join in the middle of the year I will prorate the dues. In 2014 I collected dues through the meet-up site. However, getting dues out of the we pay system proved to be a problem.\u00a0In 2015 I will only be collecting dues in cash at events. This money is used to pay the cost of hosting the meet-up (approximately $140 per year) and if there are any remaining funds to purchase items like glow bracelets for night walks or paper goods for potluck events.<\/p>",

Yeah, there is old man baseball, but you have to be over 30 or in some cases 40 to play. There are plenty of people out there who miss the feel of a real baseball, the challenge of hitting a curve. The recreational youth leagues end at 18 years old. After that there are few opportunities to find 18 or so guys, or girls, and equipment to have a real game. This meetup is an effort to find enough bodies to have a game or two of fun, non competitive bliss on the diamond. So sign up and maybe we can make this a reality.<\/p>",

Typical events will include a 5 to 6 mile hike, 2 to 3 hours, followed by a sumptuous meal and when possible a visit to a winery and or local attraction. Focus is the enjoyment of DC area's abundant trails, parks\u00a0and nature resources. All events will be undoubtedly sprinkled with interesting and engaging conversation. In the spirit of great American traditions all view points, opinions and critiques either positive or spicy on any topic will be respected. We all live successful lives and can offer insightful views which will be respected, honored and cherished. Events are all weather outings with members free to come and go as they please. No fees are involved. Join for some or part of the day as your schedule permits. Are you single looking for a partner? Are you partnered and looking for a fun day of exercise in nature? Are you new to the area and need friends? Has the couch, office or routines of life become a place of boredom? We are your answer. Join us and explore the opportunities and new horizons the Washington DC metro area offers. My textable cell number is 202-578-8390. We are a kid- free zone with all members, 18 and above, responsible for themselves. Neither the organizer nor group bares any legal liability risks for members' losses or injuries. Obviously the Good Samaritan rule applies in any and all cases which means look after one another on the trails, play smart and stay safe.<\/p>",

Well, if it wasn't part of common knowledge, it is now.<\/p>\n<p>So to keep us writers from falling off the edge into total insanity, we need pals, and good ones.<\/p>\n<p>This is a group for people who are currently working on a book project. It can be any kind of book, fiction, non-fiction, memoir, self-help, history, politics, collection of essays. We get together once a month to read and critique each other's work, pick each other up when we're in doubt of ourselves, give honest feedback and wholehearted encouragement.<\/p>\n<p>Because of the nature of the activities involved, we will break out into small groups (3-4 people) when necessary. The goal is to give every one sufficient opportunity to be heard and critiqued.<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to the chaotic and beautiful lives of authors!<\/p>",

This group is for software developers in the Baltimore,MD area that care about the quality of their work and want to practice and improve their programming skills, share what they know and learn new things from others. This is a hands-on coding user group with no presentations. Each meeting will be a dojo where we will go through a challenging software craftsmanship exercise that focuses on clean code, test-driven development, design patterns, and refactoring. We will pair up and practice on a kata in order to learn and apply the values, principles, and disciplines of software craftsmanship. Come with your laptop equipped with your favorite programming and automated unit testing environment. Be prepared to pair up, learn, share and have fun!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We thank <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/DC-Software-Craftsmanship\/\">Washington,DC Software Craftsmanship<\/a> group for their help with starting up this group in Baltimore.<\/p>",

Let's get together, talk about the realities of day to day living, and support one another through these debilitating illnesses.  Too many do not know about these illnesses.  Through Group Meets, we can discuss what we are going through, build support through one another, as well as add to data I have been putting together with a few other people to find common factors to help find cures.  We all hold a piece of this puzzle.  We know our bodies and what is going on inside more than the doctors do at this point.  Let's work together to educate others as well so people don't have to suffer for years before understanding why.",

        "description": "<p><b>About the Silver Spring Film Club - Movie Nightcap<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Watching movies is fun. Exhaustive research we\u2019ve conducted shows that watching movies with friends is 4.87% ABV times more fun. The best part about movies, however, is talking about them. Movies can be exciting, infuriating, thought provoking, or even solve global crises.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our group is for movie fans interested in checking out independent, classic, foreign, and vintage blockbuster movies, and at times discussing the movie afterword. Come join us!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><b>Why Silver Spring?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>First of all, why not? Second, the AFI Silver Theater, located in downtown Silver Spring, is the best theater in the universe, ever, ever. They offer a great selection of the types of films mentioned above (and beer!). We check out a lot of movies at the AFI Silver Theater.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Although we\u2019re based in Silver Spring and are head-over-heels for the AFI, we are open to seeing films at the Regal Majestic 20 in Silver Spring, one of the independent theaters in DC, and even outdoor screenings during the warmer months.&nbsp;<span>Just let us know what screenings you are interested in. We don\u2019t discriminate. (Except against snakes. Snakes are not invited, and their opinions are unwelcome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Come see a movie with us, and join us afterwards to chat about it. We may have some food or drinks and a heated yet friendly discussion after the movie.<\/p>\n<p><br><b>How It Works<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We have meetups at least twice a month, so check back often. Chances are, we will be seeing one of your favorite movies, or one you\u2019ve always been meaning to see. Occasionally, we\u2019ll see a movie that none of your friends would be willing to see.&nbsp;After you RSVP for the event, you can buy your tickets either online on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.afi.com\/silver\/\">AFI&nbsp; Silver's website<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.afi.com\/silver\/\"><\/a>, or at the AFI box office. Before the movie we gather as a group, at the AFI Cafe inside the lobby, so newcomers can meet everyone and old friends can chat. <br> <br><b>RSVPing\/No-Shows<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span>A brief word about RSVPing for an event- If you RSVPed, and discover that you can't make it to the meetup\u2026. No problem!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>But PLEASE change your RSVP to \"no\" so we as organizers are not waiting for you to show up to the theater. (The AFI staff is tired of seeing us crying and playing the Charlie Brown Theme in the lobby.)<\/p>\n<p>If this becomes an issue repeat offenders may be removed from the group. (Also, it will go on your permanent record.)<\/p>\n<p>And please don't show up to the meetup without RSVPing. We want to be able to find each other at the theater!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><b>About the Organizers<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Pete, Nate, and Airrion are three regular gentlemen (we use this term loosely) who share a love of movies, beer, and good-natured trash talking. They have combined forces (undecided as of yet whether for good or evil) on a podcast called Movie Nightcap during which they talk about a movie they have just watched. &nbsp;Their involvement in this group comes from their passion for the unique experience movies offer when people watch them together, have a beverage, and chat. These are the same reasons the podcast, Movie Nightcap, was created. &nbsp;If you are interested in checking out the podcast you can find it on <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/movie-nightcap\/id907240490?mt=2]iTunes[\/url\">iTunes<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stitcher.com\/podcast\/movie-nightcap\">Stitcher<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/poddirectory.com\/podcast\/13361\/movie-nightcap\">Poddirectory<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p> <br><b>Ideas, Questions, Feedback<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Please feel free to message any of the three organizers with your ideas, suggestions, and feedback. We are always happy to hear from you. As new group organizers, we are learning on the job. Thank you for your interest and your patience as this group develops. (But be gentle.)<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>If you're looking for a friendly roleplaying group that's welcoming to anyone from complete novices to experienced roleplayers this is the group you're looking for.<\/p>\n<p>Nearly every Friday night (sometimes Saturday or Sunday afternoon) this group will meet to play indie RPGs, which we're defining as anything that's not Dungeons &amp; Dragons or Pathfinder. Most sessions will be open on a first RSVP first play basis. There will be a mix of continuing campaigns and one-shot adventures with the goal to keep mixing up genres and systems as we go forward. New players are welcome to join any session that is open to RSVP.&nbsp;<span>Our approach gives you the freedom to pop into a session when real life allows and to focus on having a fun time. You need to bring nothing except enthusiasm. This group is wonderfully nice and supportive; this is tabletop roleplaying as it should be.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Since September 2013 we've played <em>Always\/Never\/Now<\/em>, <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer<\/em> (Cinematic Unisystem),&nbsp;<em>Call of Catthulu<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>Call of Cthulu<\/em>, <em>Cosmic Patrol<\/em>, <em>Doctor Who: Adventures in Time and Space<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>Dread<\/em>, <i>Dungeon World<\/i>,&nbsp;<em>Eclipse Phase<\/em>, <i>Fate<\/i>,&nbsp;<em>Fiasco<\/em>, <i>Ganakagok<\/i>, <i>Hillfolk<\/i>,&nbsp;<em>Icons<\/em>, <em>In Nomine<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>King Arthur Pendragon, Laundry Files<\/em>, <i>The Mountain Witch<\/i>,&nbsp;<em>Mouse Guard, Newsies &amp; Bootblacks<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>Primeval, Rocket Age, Shab-al-HIri Roach, Star Trek<\/em> (Last Unicorn Games),&nbsp;<em>Star Wars<\/em> (West End Games),&nbsp;<i>Wicked Lies and Alibis<\/i>, <i>Witchcraft<\/i>, and <em>Yggdrasil<\/em>.&nbsp;<span>Our goal is to play at least 10 new RPGs every year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>My wife (Michelle) and I (Kirk) host these sessions at our house and will provide vegetarian meals and snacks. We have three types of meetups:&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><span><b>Private Session<\/b>: This is where a member of the group has wrangled 4+ other players for me (Kirk) to run a RPG, typically one I've already run for the group, at my house. I'm aiming to do 1-2 of these every month.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>RPG Gala<\/b><span>: This involves up to 4 GMs running different RPGs for a maximum of 24 people. These will alternate between Friday, Saturday, and Sunday sessions. We always need volunteers to GM and these events are only possible when we have enough GMs to make it work.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>LARP<\/b>: We're going to try once every four months to run a LARP with politics, intrigue, and mystery. This will be a sci-fi fantasy setting that specific enough to frame the scenario but vague enough for you to make your character your own.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p><span><b>Good Enough Gaming<\/b>: These are tutorials and help sessions for people wanting to learn how to GM or merely pick up some tricks on how to improve their game.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns don't hesitate to message me!<\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Frequently Asked Questions<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Q) What will be provided at the session?<\/strong> <br>A) Some sessions will have snacks provided and some dinner, they will be labelled. Food will be vegetarian and usually there will be sodas and some snack food; hot water and an assortment of tea bags will always be provided. We also have plenty of pens, pencils, paper, notecards, and dice.&nbsp; <br> <br><strong>Q) What should I bring?<\/strong> <br>A) A sense of fun and teamwork! No rules knowledge or prior experience is presumed. Contributions of snacks or sodas are always appreciated. Try to keep things PG-13 in tone when possible.&nbsp; <br> <br><strong>Q) What should I not bring?<\/strong> <br>A) No alcohol or pets please. <br> <br><strong>Q) What's the parking situation?<\/strong> <br>A) Parking is available in the driveway and along the street. The best location if not in the driveway is alongside the curb of the nearby park between our house and Tamarack Road.&nbsp;<\/p>",

Our rituals are always free and open to the public. We have been celebrating magic in public spaces since 1999. Our motto, \u201cStop, drop, and do ritual\u201d, sums up our philosophy in seeking public and accessible areas to do magic. Connect DC creates ritual at boundary stones, in the parks, on city streets, behind the White House, next to the Anacostia River and within national demonstrations. Our goals are to heal our city with magic, mystery and celebration, and to create an expectation for public pagan ritual in the city proper. Announcements of upcoming rituals and other activities are distributed via the Connect DC announcement list. One can join the list by sending a message to ConnectDC-subscribe@yahoogroups.com Join us.

The primary purpose of this group is to schedule open training sessions to work on basic skills and co-ed pickup games. House Rules: Sportsmanship is in effect. Fair, ethical, respectful play with a sense of fellowship with all players is required. No fouling, slide tackling or any gamesmanship tactics that could lead to injury. Infractions of this rule could lead to ejection from the game. Keep the game moving. Off-sides, out of bounds, hands, and unintentional fouls will only be called if clear and obvious or under rules of sportsmanship called by yourself. In these cases pass the ball quickly to the other team and keep playing. Corner kick will only be granted only if the defense intentionally kicks the ball over the goal line otherwise goal kick. The person who runs for the ball unchallenged gets to bring it in. There is no 11 meter. Keep in mind there are inexperienced, mature, and\/or injured coed players on the field. No trophies or cash prizes will be handed out at the end of the night and next week the teams will be different. Have fun, be safe and respectful at all times. Otherwise FIFA rules are in effect.<\/p>",

And on the quirkier side, we try things like milking cows at county fairs, learning how to tap maple syrup, or hosting a finger painting party!<\/p>\n<p>We're about trying new things and exploring the DC metro area and beyond like somewhat of a tourist. You'll be a great fit for the group if you're light-hearted, up for trying new things, and find fun in whatever you do. Would you rather skip and sing in public rather than sit on the sidelines?

We also love His extraordinary natural creation. One of the greatest forms of worship is spending time enjoying all He has done. It can be difficult to meet Christians outside of our respective churches; this is a way to expand your group of Christian friends that enjoy doing the things we outdoors enthusiasts love, all while glorifying God!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>All are welcome to join regardless of their background and religious affiliation. We respect each other and our differences, but maintain that the core belief of this group is based on the acceptance of Jesus Christ alone. If you are not a Christian, that is OK, just keep in mind you will be surrounded by them, and we love one another and will love you! :) This will be an environment where we can freely share the love and knowledge of Christ without judgment. It is also a place where others can learn of Christ and accept Him as their Lord and Savior, if they wish. In addition to our outdoors activities we can discuss the bible (a favorite topic), our faith, ask questions, share testimonies, understand and get to know our different backgrounds and strengthen each other in our walk with Christ and in our lives. The primary purpose of this group is to bring to believers in Christ together through doing things we enjoy, so talking about Jesus will be very likely and even encouraged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We would love to have an active group, so if you are interested in leading an event in a particular area, <strong><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">please contact us<\/span><\/strong>, and we might reach out to some of you for help.

        "description": "<p>BALTIMORE SUPPORT GROUP for SOCIAL ANXIETIES. Shy, Introverts and Anxious people Welcome! Hi. I'm Rachel, started attending a support group in DC over 3yrs ago. I have social anxieties and I was becoming agoraphobia. I was self-isolating and avoiding human interactions. I've been facilitating the Support Group Meetings in DC for Social Anxieties for over 2yrs. I'm the organizer of \" DC Social Anxiety Support Group Events\" Meet Up. I live in Baltimore and I want to expand into this area. Typically we have 5-6people attending our weekly\/biweekly. Wednesday meeting. We share our experiences living with and overcoming our anxieties. Baltimore meetings will be on Wednesdays at 7:30-8:30pm. We'll start with a Casual Conversation about Social Skills. (For example making eye contact, making phone calls, giving and receiving compliments, office parties.) We'll go around and say our Names and a Personal Triumph. (For example, I went on an interview, I attended a meet up.) Then we will have an Open Discussion. We can discuss different social situations, difficulties, and challenges. We will finish the meeting with Personal Goals. (For example Connect more with friends and family). Hopefully together we will find good Solutions, Ideas, and Advice. The purpose of this meeting, so you can go through the day in a calm and smoother way, with less anxieties. This group might not be the exact answer for you, But please consider attending at least of our meet ups. This is a great place to start! Once you get the momentum rolling you will surprise yourself! We also do different fun activities around the city. Please note this is peer support only NOT Professional help. This is for people with social anxieties only, if you want to bring a friend or family member as encouraging support that's fine. STUDENTS! If you are \"required to attend a support group\" for a College Course Credit, you're can call me to discuss you LEADING one of our meeting.(I mean guiding our the conversation with me shadowing you.) I we post a notice for that Wednesday, stating, we will be having a guest facilitator. You are NOT Allowed to just come to Observe Us. (Go to AA instead, because these people are too SHY! I have a hard enough time getting them to open up and talk about their issues, without you watching them!) Thank you for Respecting Our Shyness.<\/p>",

There is no membership fee; however, if you want to make a small donation, we'll use it towards maintaining this website. \u00a0Meetup attendance varies based on the weather and folks' schedules. \u00a0Generally, the nicer the weather, more bullies come out and play!!<\/p>\n<p>When we send a Meetup announcement, we will provide the date, time, and location, in addition to a map to the dog park. Also, at the park, we will have a welcome sign.<\/p>\n<p>It's so exciting to see all the beautiful bulldogs together (see pictures from recent meet ups).<\/p>\n<p>Please join us!<\/p>",

If you ever need a hand, I'll work to learn.\" Well, I never like throwing people into the mix until we had a chance to discuss your level and goals. If I'm going to show you some things I want it to be for both our benefit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>So this group will cover things from equipment, to understanding the subject, to workflows, to prints while shooting what we love to shoot after learning all the rules. You have to learn them so we can break them to make it your own art.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The DMV Photography Workshops has a 1275-3200 sq. ft. studio home base in Baltimore City at SkyloftFRentalStudio.com. &nbsp;Some of the workshops are also conducted by other groups and organizations, because we want to keep our members informed of some of the best workshops know matter where or who is conducting them. The goal is to learn more about what we love, any place. With that we also offer a <b><i>10% discount <\/i><\/b>on Skyloft F Studio Rental time!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>So if you are a professional photographer, and would like to conduct a workshop showcasing how you do something please let us know. And members, if you would like to see a particular workshop offered please let us no at anytime so we can grow as a resource.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>All workshops are instructional and hands on training to help give you the complete \"How &amp; Why?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you have any questions, just drop us an email.

        "description": "<p><em>The group is for active Washingtonians in their late 30s, 40s, and early 50s who like to travel. Since we, as Gen X Washingtonians in our older\/wiser age, tend to be more selective about where and how we travel, this group\u2019s focus is on non-touristy, responsible travel (to local, domestic and international destinations).<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Non-touristy just means high-quality trips to cool, distinctive destinations (e.g., Iceland) with lots of character, as opposed to the cheapest vacations to the same old touristy spots. Responsible simply means patronizing locally-owned hotels and restaurants so that we give back - the money you spend stays in the local community, which is not the case with most mass tourism that only works with the huge international chains.<\/p>\n<p>Besides that as a guiding principle, we go wherever we want to go! Near and far, domestic and international, beach and city, mountains and lakes, adventure and relaxation, long weekends and weekend to weekends, and anywhere in between or longer! This is our travel club and it\u2019s all about us! So if you like to travel to cool, fun places and are looking for like-minded, new friends to travel with, then this is the group for you!<\/p>\n<p>How do we decide where to go? Easy\u2026 while I\u2019ll offer some trips for consideration, we\u2019ll chat about locales of interest here online, and at local meet-ups at different bars &amp; restaurants in the city. Fantastic way to get to know each other and the oh so many neighborhood spots in DC. Always new places to check out &amp; many neighborhoods to keep up with\u2026 so might as well check them out with new friends and do some travel planning at the same time! We also can do other types of quality, local DC outings (e.g., walks\/hikes, volunteering) to keep in touch, continue our travel ideas, and build lasting friendships with our fellow city and metro neighbors.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

The book is written by a contemporary Christian author, but the group is open to all, regardless of religious beliefs.\u00a0We will also enjoy social outings that are conducive to meeting potential dates \u2013 after all, you\u2019ll never meet anyone if you don\u2019t put yourself out there.

Do you need new friends to get out and hike, camp, kayak, or snowboard? How about I add in craft beer and homebrewing? We're an eclectic group but we love to get out and enjoy what nature has to offer (from mountains to gardens to hops). Seriously, who doesn't love a nice brew on the top of a beautiful mountain? We also keep our events small to foster an intimate atmosphere where you can form real friendships. So come join in the adventure!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Please Note:<\/strong> We are about outdoors adventures first and beer second. Please do not join if you only want to come to pint nights or if you just want to get drunk.

Please do not RSVP \"No\" in advance to every event listed on the entire calendar you already know you can't attend.)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>2) If you do not show up to an event without giving 24 hours notice, you will be counted as a \"No Show.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>3) People who \"No Show\" 3 times, will be put on restriction and will not be able to RSVP or attend events for 3 months. The Event Organizers definitely understand that situations can come up at the last minute that you can't always control, which is why we give you 3.<\/em> <br> <br> <em>4) \"No shows\" will eventually be removed from members account, based on your attendance at other events.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>5) To cover the cost the organizers pay Meetup.com to run the group, we ask for members to contribute $2.75 in yearly dues. Please pay your dues within 3 weeks&nbsp;of joining (and then by Oct 1 each year after), or you will be removed from group events (especially those where paid members are on the wait list) until you pay. The link to pay is on the left side of the page.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>You might also be able to arrange to buy me a beer at one of our events in exchange for dues. Just arrange this in advanced so you aren't removed from an event and so I don't have 5 people offering me a beer at one event. ;)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>6) A clear picture of your face is required to join the group, so we can recognize you at events. No snow goggles, sunglasses, Halloween costumes - and no wilderness shots where you are too far away to recognize. <br> <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>These policies have been put into place to encourage respectfulness and active participation in the group.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you for your attention to these policies! :)<\/em><\/p>",

I will be traveling around the United States and possibly some parts of Europe photo documenting some of the most gorgeous naturalistas with queenly tresses to be envied. Eventually I will produce a photo book depicting iconic images of natural hair, along with bios and hair care regimens of the natural queens featured. Join me in this journey of celebrating the beauty of natural hair right here at home by creating a network where naturalistas in any stage of their natural hair journey can feel safe, accepted, and learn from one another. We'll have events such as photo shoots, poetry reading sessions, hair care product reviews, natural hair advice seminars, and much more.",

        "description": "<p>In the second half of 2013, the crafty nonprofit\/thrift store&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/scrapdc.org\/\">SCRAP DC<\/a>&nbsp;moved to its current Brookland location, and a few months later, began hosting this Meetup. They wanted to provide a place where you, our members, could assemble, chat, and maybe trade some tips while working on artistic works-in-progress. It sure didn't hurt to have an eclectic assortment of art supplies right outside the workroom, where you could make some quick purchases before a session if needed. However, as \"scrap\" took over several tenants' studios and then the storage closet, that back room became THE place for volunteers to do their work of sorting and pricing new donations.<\/p>\n<p>Enter our hostess -- now Meetup co-organizer -- Marcelle! After pipes burst and flooded our usual venue, she rescued our March session with just one day's notice, and... wow -- kept finding room for the many who showed up last Tuesday night! We look forward to more of the same, with some potential alternate nights offered, perhaps with a little more frequency during these warmer months. We absolutely hope that you'll still visit SCRAP for art and office supplies when they're open (Wed.-Sun. noon-6). Now that we know our move won't be so temporary, tho', we'll change the default venue to Marcelle's studio, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/701+Monroe+St+NE,+Washington,+DC+20017\/@38.932128,-76.995941,17z\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89b7c7f1d3255725:0xd3fcb0648a2cdeec?hl=en\">#15 on the Arts Walk<\/a> (between 7th and 8th along Monroe Street NE). We hereby rename the group, too. You're all now members of \"Get Craftin' in DC.\"<\/p>\n<p>If you like making things by hand, please join us!&nbsp;<span>All skills and skill levels welcome: whether you knit, sew, crochet, origami, scrapbook, embroider, quilt, mend clothes, make jewelry or anything else, I hope you will find a new home in this group.<\/span><\/p>",

I know I can go to Park Heights for yummy Jamaican and\/or Trinidadian foods or travel to Randallstown for a little \u201cinternational\u201d grocery shoppin; but where can I go to buy a bottle of Kremas, piece of pain patate, or bottle of l\u2019huile maskriti? Where can I go to sit down and eat lambi, legume avec sous poi, or diri a djon djon? Clueless!&nbsp; <br> <\/p>\n<p>When I came across the Meet Up site, it hit me-&nbsp;<b><i>WHY NOT CREATE A GROUP JUST SO YOU CAN MEET AND SOCIALIZE W\/FELLOW HAITIANS LIVING IN BALTIMORE?&nbsp;<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>My vision for this group is to create opportunities to bring Haitians and\/or Haitian-Americans together.&nbsp;<i><b>By no means is this a dating site!&nbsp;<\/b><\/i>If you are seeking to establish a connection with people of Haitian descent while exploring all of the cultural experiences Baltimore and the surrounding cities have to offer, then by all means, welcome!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br> <\/p>",

Develop it.<\/p>\n<p>It can be intimidating for women to learn and ask questions when they are in an extreme minority. While open and welcoming, today's budding developer community is up to 91% male. There isn't a comfortable place where women can learn at their own pace and not be afraid to ask \"stupid questions.\"<\/p>\n<p>We decided it was time to provide a place where all questions are OK and everyone can learn in a supportive environment. Our courses focus on coding, leveraging existing technology, and having something to show for it (aka building sweet websites).<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for supporting Girl Develop It on our mission to make software development easy, affordable and accessible to all women.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.girldevelopit.com\/donate\">Your contribution<\/a>\u00a0helps us expand our mission to create great programs and opportunities for women learning to code.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Interested in helping as a teacher, teacher assistant, sponsor or in another way?

        "description": "<p>My name is Steve Smith.\u00a0 I live in Columbia, MD, work as an accountant, and am fifty-one years old.\u00a0 I've been a vegetarian\u00a0since 1980. \u00a0I consider myself a life-long student of spirituality and meditation,\u00a0and study with H.H. Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj, an internationally renowned author, meditation teacher, and spiritual leader.\u00a0 For more information about Sant Rajinder Singh and the tradition of Sant Mat, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sos.org\/\">www.sos.org<\/a>.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>About Our Group:<\/p>\n<p>The theme of the group will be meditation in the Sant Mat tradition (customarily translated as <i>The Path of the Masters<\/i>).\u00a0 I hope to create a space where everyone feels welcome and we enjoy our time together.\u00a0 Thank you to other meetup group coordinators\u00a0of Baltimore Vegetarian Group, Columbia Insight Meditation Group, and ZenAdventures for letting their members know about us.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I\u00a0plan to start and end the group with short, 10-15 minutes meditation sittings.\u00a0\u00a0 Most of the time at Oakland Manor will be a chance to learn more about the teachings with opportunities to ask questions or share with one another as well.<\/p>\n<p>After our meetings, we will have\u00a0opportunites to get together for dinner or other activities which may be suggested.\u00a0 Love and fellowship are our cornerstones, yet we seek to first nurture ourselves by going within via meditation.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Meetings will generally be held 2nd and 4th Sundays at Hebron House in Ellicott City, Maryland.<\/p>\n<p>PLEASE READ OUR MEETUP PAGE REGULARLY FOR OUR LATEST ANNOUNCEMENTS<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>A Personal Testimony:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In early 1980, I first found out about yoga when an English Professor handed me a book.\u00a0 I had already been exposed to meditation techniques at home, because my mother and two brothers had practiced alternative methods.\u00a0 I yearned for more in my life, and I wasn't sure where to find it.\u00a0 The theory of yoga and how everything is within us struck a chord.\u00a0 I started to \"OM\" on my bed in\u00a0my dormitory room.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Naturally, when my folks found out about my search, though they were open-minded, they were also concerned.\u00a0 In truth, so was I.\u00a0\u00a0This was\u00a0years before the internet, and\u00a0I struggled to gather information about what\u00a0my spiritual options were.\u00a0 I attended Bible studies on campus, and I also enjoyed reading about Buddhist meditation practices.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>After the spring semester, I returned to my folks' home, and my mother handed me a California publication called \"Common Ground\".\u00a0\u00a0 I leafed through about 30 pages and came across an interesting ad:\u00a0 \"Are you really seeking God?\u00a0 Do you expect to find Him in massages and whirlpools?\"\u00a0 Then there was a quote by Darshan Singh about the cry of the soul.\u00a0 I was amused and intrigued. I wrote to California (snail mail - no email in those days) and in return, I received a few handouts and the phone number of someone in Columbia, Maryland who coordinated the local satsang (spiritual meeting).\u00a0 I attended my first satsang, and my life's never been the same since.<\/p>\n<p>I respect\u00a0other meditation\u00a0paths, and I enjoy sitting in with other groups.\u00a0\u00a0Many\u00a0people nowadays\u00a0benefit from various meditation practices.\u00a0\u00a0To say that all\u00a0meditation paths are the same is a different story.\u00a0\u00a0Not all fitness programs are the same, not all diets offer the same results, and not all academic institutions offer the same quality of\u00a0education --\u00a0Why should we\u00a0imagine that all spiritual paths or meditation practices aim towards the same goal or are equal in their ability to conduce towards spiritual\u00a0awakening and empowerment?\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Sant Mat still appeals to me as offering the most comprehensive and hopeful message and the highest possible goal.\u00a0 I've discovered what many others before me have learned:\u00a0 Spiritual development involves many paradoxes.\u00a0 In order to make \"quick\" progress, we need to learn how to become \"still\".\u00a0 If we are in a \"hurry\" to experience inner peace and fulfillment, we need to development \"patience\".\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I'd never trade my good fortune in being led to this path for anything else.\u00a0 It's always felt like a great blessing to be led to a caring, competent spiritual Guide, and the price I've had to pay is commitment and opening my heart.\u00a0\u00a0Spirituality is a gift like any other gift of nature.\u00a0 In the Sant Mat tradition, programs are offered for free.\u00a0 In a country like the States, we need to put our suspicions on hold for a few moments and allow this simple thought to sink in.\u00a0 It's not easy to discover ourselves.\u00a0 Many of us arrive at the doorstep of direct spirituality and mysticism after a long and painful journey.\u00a0When we connect with the love that's already within us, healing naturally occurs.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I've shared a little of my story, because I wanted to highlight how this is a personal experience for each one of us, and there's hope.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Best Wishes to everyone on your own spiritual journeys.<\/p>\n<p>Steve<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>",

        "description": "As a pain sufferer, I know (firsthand) that pain can significantly impact our personal lives as well as the lives of the people around us; so much so that  I often think of it as another dramatization of the \"Butterfly Effect\".  There has to be something better than daily doses of NSAIDs, addictive drugs (opioids) being dispensed through massive prescription writing by physicians.  America is about 5% of the world population yet we consume over 80% of the world's pain pills!  I feel that it is time we embrace the amazing possibility that the body can restore itself to its natural pain threshold to help increase our quality of motion.  Quality of Motion = Quality of LIFE!",

        "description": "<p>Forget business as \"usual\". This club is for real estate investors who want more out of a club than just passing out business cards with the hope that they connect with the right person or service.<\/p>\n<p>This is NOT a lead generation club or one of those business development-type networking meet-ups where you give a 1-2 minute sales pitch of your business followed by a lecture with training material for sale or back of the room products to promote. So if you are a Multi-level marketer, biz dev type, account rep or sales person, this club will not be a great fit for you.<\/p>\n<p>This club is about meeting people who can help you build a real estate business. Some members will have money to invest and some will have projects looking for investors. In this club, you will be able to create or join an investment group with other members. The purpose of investments groups is for like-minded members to freely share their investment ideals and offer advice on how to evaluate real estate deals for the best possible cash flow, profit margin and\/or return on investment (ROI).<\/p>\n<p>Our club aims to develop new ideas and solutions to the ever changing marketplace and then put them into practice for buying and selling real estate. We focus a lot on all types of deal structuring on land, single family, multi-family, rehabs and other property types. We promote the ideal of partnerships to acquire assets when buying alone is not an available option.<\/p>\n<p>Our club meets weekly for regular meetings and once a month for our Open Forum. Members are encouraged to present topics and solutions to the group during our Open Forums and discuss current real estate issues and offer suggestions and advice to other real estate investors seeking assistance. We invite industry professionals to speak at our open forums and we promote a simple motto \u201cone must create a mutually beneficial relationship with others in the industry to grow and expand\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>This club is not always about business. We occasionally meet socially for fun networking activities to foster deeper connections with one another. We support the ideal of the payment of dues to enhance our standing in the community by contributing our time and money and industry insight to charitable organizations.<\/p>\n<p>We invite you to watch our video at <a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/I86DdhRdtYU\">http:\/\/youtu.be\/I86DdhRdtYU<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"embedded\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=I86DdhRdtYU\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=I86DdhRdtYU<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Feel free to visit us at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jointventureptnr.com\/\">http:\/\/www.jointventureptnr.com\/<\/a><\/p>",

Support is available for anyone who has had an NDE and is trying to integrate the experience.<\/p>\n<p>Meeting format varies from month to month and can include presentations by those who have experienced NDEs; movies, documentaries, TV shows, or videos of presentations from the IANDS conferences; or general open discussion and sharing among the group. Recent meetings have included a presentation and workshop by Mary Grace, author of \"The Communion of Saints; Talking to God and Grandma.\"<\/p>\n<p>All are welcome, whether you have had an NDE or STE, if you have suffered the loss of a loved one, or are merely interested in learning more,\u00a0discussing these topics, and meeting like-minded kindred spirits!<\/p>",

The Rotary Club is a local club of Rotary International, a worldwide organization of business people who have been dedicated to service projects for over a century, fostering goodwill and world peace through helping communities in need. The Rotary motto is \"Service Above Self.\" Our club's signature project is Disaster Aid USA. The mission of Disaster Aid USA is to provide immediate disaster relief and humanitarian aid both domestic (in the USA) and international (worldwide) to victims suffering the effects of a disaster. Disaster Aid USA utilizes the 4 Way Test and guiding principles of Rotary, and adheres to the United Nations and Sphere Standards while providing disaster relief and humanitarian aid. The club performs a number of community service projects including: Margaret Brent Fun Day, where we provide games, pony rides, clowns, pizza, etc to students with special needs and their staff; and food baskets for families in need; we sponsor six high school students to attend the Rotary Youth Leadership Awards (RYLA) conference; dictionaries for 3rd grade students; Christmas Stockings for children of incarcerated inmates at the Prince George's County Detention Center; weekend snack program for elementary school students; and backpacks for elementary school students. In addition, we support international programs, such as Rotary's End Polio Now project, and a water project in Kyotera, Raiki District, Uganda.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In addition to these service projects, we also enjoy fellowship with club members, family, and friends.&nbsp;<span>The Rotary Club of Historic Prince George's County meets every Wednesday, at 6:15PM, at the Comfort Inn and Conference Center, 4500 Crain Hwy., Bowie, MD 20716 .&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>",

A Mastermind Group is a small number of high-performing professionals and business owners, not necessarily in the same industry, who get together on a regular basis to discuss and brainstorm around challenges and opportunities. At each meeting, a different member brings up the challenges and opportunities he or she is facing. The individual and collective expertise and experience of the other members are then brought to the table. We hammer out creative solutions, and the brainstorming gives rise to insights not only for the current meeting's member, but for all present. DC Mastermind is a newly-formed such group and is seeking a small pool of suitable members based in Washington D.C.",

        "description": "<p>Embodied Awakening\/Embracing Vulnerability exists for people who want to embody their essential nature by exploring the power of vulnerability and honesty. &nbsp;It is for those who are tired of taking refuge in their beliefs and are serious about discovering the deepest intimacy with life that only comes from slowing way down and becoming deeply honest with oneself. &nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>Similarly, this group is designed for people who see relationship as a vehicle for awakening. &nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>This group focuses on the profound impact vulnerability has in our lives. &nbsp;We consider the defining moments of any relationship: when we shield our hearts away from or open fully in the midst of the difficult moments that arise in everyday life.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>When relationship is used as a spiritual practice, it will act as a furnace that stokes the fire that burns within. It will support your awakening, flushing everything out that's not true - all of the conditioned beliefs and defense strategies - and inviting the deepest part of you to come forth in this world.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>Chris and Jennifer Rubacky are the teachers of this group. &nbsp;They have been in a conscious partnership for over a decade and married since 2005. &nbsp;They have devoted themselves to using their relationship as a crucible for embodying their essential nature in all aspects of their lives. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>We begin with a silent meditation each week. &nbsp;All questions are welcome and everyone will have time to share. &nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>Suggested Donation: $20 dollars ($5-$20 dollars suggested sliding scale; no one turned away for lack of funds).&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>If you would like to learn more please see Jennifer's website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iammet.com\">www.iammet.com<\/a><\/p> \n<p>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.iammet.com\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p>",

What better way to do that than to have a group with other like-minded young women who are building their spiritual journey as well? Enjoy events such as bible studies, nights out, fellowship festivals, prayer groups, dancing, movies, and other fun and uplifting events. These should help us not only grow in our fellowship but also build positive relationships with other Christian women who are interested in similar things. I look forward to meeting with you all soon. Enjoy and many blessings!",

        "description": "<p>This group is for active Baltimore Gen X'ers in their late 30s, 40s, and early 50s who like to travel. Since we, as Gen X'ers, in our older\/wiser age, tend to be more selective about where and how we travel, this group\u2019s focus is on non-touristy, responsible travel (to local, domestic and international destinations).<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Non-touristy just means high-quality trips to cool, distinctive destinations (e.g., Iceland) with lots of character, as opposed to the cheapest vacations to the same old touristy spots. Responsible simply means patronizing locally-owned hotels and restaurants so that we give back - the money you spend stays in the local community, which is not the case with most mass tourism that only works with the huge international chains.<\/p>\n<p>Besides that as a guiding principle, we go wherever we want to go! Near and far, domestic and international, beach and city, mountains and lakes, adventure and relaxation, long weekends and weekend to weekends, and anywhere in between or longer! This is our travel club and it\u2019s all about us! So if you like to travel to cool, fun places and are looking for like-minded, new friends to travel with, then this is the group for you!<\/p>\n<p>How do we decide where to go? Easy\u2026 while I\u2019ll offer some trips for consideration, we\u2019ll chat about locales of interest that you have... here online, and at local meet-ups at different bars &amp; restaurants in the city. Fantastic way to get to know each other and the oh so many neighborhood spots in Baltimore. Always new places to check out &amp; many neighborhoods to keep up with\u2026 so might as well check them out with new friends and do some travel planning at the same time! We also can do other types of quality, local Baltimore outings (e.g., walks\/hikes, volunteering) to keep in touch, continue our travel ideas, and build lasting friendships with our fellow city and metro neighbors.<\/p>\n<p>[Note: This group is the Baltimore-based, sister meetup group of the Washington DC Gen X Travel Club.]<br>\n\n<\/p>",

If you are curious or interested in djing\u2026this is the place for you; if you want to dust off and remove the cobwebs from your equipment and ignite the passion inside you or simply promote your next event\u2026this is the place for you; Lastly, should you lack self confidence and always doubting your abilities than this is the place for you. Seriously ladies let us truly get together and support one another, network, enjoy music, and more importantly just have fun in the process.\u00a0One of my goals is for us to continue meeting\u00a0with other members who are\u00a0interested in wanting to practice together, teach, learn, share ideas\/skills , and offer great criticism. My other goal (along with so much more) is to throw random listening parties which will allow member djs to\u00a0participate in 30-45 minute sets\u00a0rotation style.\u00a0Ladies, please keep in mind this meet up group is intended to promote unity, mentorship, peace, and love; However, if you are someone with a big ego who enjoys humiliating or tearing down an individual or individuals based on their skills or lack of then this is not the place for you. I am into the uplifting business so ladies if you are with me, please join me into this sisterhood.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Please Note: To all interested in the practice sessions, if you have equipment (laptop w\/ dj software or vinyl, turntables, cdjs, midi controllers, mixer, studio monitors, etc) you would like to practice with please feel free to bring whatever you are comfortable with.\u00a0\u00a0If you do not have equipment, show up anyway, I am willing to share mine with anyone interested.\u00a0 Eventually, my ultimate goal is to have in- house equipment available to members for their convenience for personal use or for gigs.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Dues (Not sure yet) Dues will be used for purchasing in-house equipment, space rental fee, field trips, planning events, etc.<\/p>",

I started this group because I find that it's challenging making friends living in the DMV(DC, Maryland, and Virginia) area. I am looking to establish a small group of women who are interested in bonding with one another like Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte-from the tv series Sex and the City. We will connect and bond in this group through sharing girl talk, networking, dinning out, attending movies, monthly book club, traveling, and anything creative that we can come up with.<\/p>\n<p>Beginning January 1, 2015, members with lack of activity for at least three months, excessive no shows, or numerous last minute cancellations will be removed from the group. Please join to participate, have fun, and bring a positive and creative attitude.<\/p>",

I know some clubs have liability forms and such.<\/b><br>\n\n Please re-read meetup.com\u2019s terms of service, especially section 6. You agreed to it in order to use this site. You may not have read it, but you had to check the box that said you did. In general, section 6 says if an organizer or any member places a event on the calendar and you get injured or something at it, it\u2019s your own fault. If you can\u2019t live with that, this group isn't for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><b>Who runs this group?<\/b><br>\n\n This meetup group is not an organization. \u00a0It is a group of people who like to get together and socialize. There is no one in charge. If someone starts telling you what to do and you don\u2019t agree with it, don\u2019t do it. Use your own common sense and leave the event if you think it is too risky or you feel uncomfortable.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>So who is this Chris, who is the organizer? Isn't he in charge?<\/b><br>\n\n Chris runs the web site. He can post calendar entries and moderate the message board, as can \u00a0any other organizers. (Moderate means if someone puts something up that is inappropriate, he can delete it.)<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>What are the rules?<\/b><br>\n\n If you want a group that has rules, you don\u2019t want this group. Ok, well just a few basic ones. \u00a01. Be safe, and 2. Be courteous towards others.\u00a0 3. Use a recent photo of yourself so people can recognize you when you attend any events.\u00a0 That means if someone does something you think is unsafe, don\u2019t do it with them. If that doesn't work for you, tell them about your concerns directly or whoever organized the event that you are uncomfortable, or email the organizers. Nothing may get done about it, so be prepared for that. No one forced you to go to an event, and no one will force you to stay on one. You can leave at any time.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>Overall, just have fun<\/b><br>\n\n I assume that everyone who joined this group wants to have fun. \u00a0If that is what you're looking for, this group is for you! \u00a0I am aware that not all groups are for everyone, so please don't take any offense to the above statements. \u00a0They are not intended to discourage anyone from joining. \u00a0We are all adults, so let's enjoy ourselves!<br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>From the annual chaos of National Novel Writing Month [NaNoWriMo]: \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/nanowrimo.org\/\">http:\/\/nanowrimo.org\/<\/a>, a small number of novelists banded together to discuss their craft and share their insights. Shortly after, it was decided that having such a resource was, not just helpful, but integral for motivation, creativity, and the editorial process of crafting a novel.<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Thusly, the Silver Spring Novelist group was born. Our goal is to form a community of local novelists to support and encourage one another. Our purpose is to present a sponsored venue for that to occur. Our mission is to act as a resource for our fellow writers, offering: places for writers to write amongst their own kind, helpful discussions about the elements of noveling, and critique partners to help move your novel to the next level. All of these will be available through the monthly meetups for members to attend.<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p>We are seeking novelist from all tiers of expertise and accepting applications, whether just starting out or authored several published novels. We only expect your writing and your novel is important to you.\u00a0The MeetUp is set to 'private' as a precautionary measure to prevent not-yet-copyrighted material from being viewed publicly. \u00a0<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a writer but not a novelist, or you\u2019re a novelist that is looking for something a more informal, we suggest you look at our parent Meetup: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SilverSpringWritersGroup\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SilverSpringWritersGroup\/<\/a>.\u00a0<span>It\u2019s a wonderful group of writers of all types: fiction, non-fiction, blogs, script, comics, etc; one that many of the people in this Novelist Group share membership.<\/span><\/p>",

(While we read the poems in Persian, they are immediately translated, and the discussions around them are in English - in other words, the group is open to all!)&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Hafez is an unrivaled &nbsp;spiritual master-poet whose mysticism has continued to win over hearts since the 14th century. The material's beauty and transcendence lends itself to \"never getting old\" with people regularly turning to Hafez's words for guidance.&nbsp; <br> <\/p>\n<p><b>HAFEZ's devotees<\/b> span the globe: from India to the US, from Germany to Australia. Goethe and Nietzche&nbsp; worshiped Hafez - Goethe went so far as &nbsp;calling Hafez his \"celestial friend.\" Meher Baba was devoted to Hafez. Inayat Khan, who introduced Sufism to the West, revered the man. And Ralph Waldo Emerson waxed lyrical about Hafez, calling him \"a poet for poets.\" I taught a private weekend class on HAFEZ for 5 years, and have drawn from that experience in designing these monthly gatherings. They should &nbsp;help us to slowly enter the world of a profound and wise mystic and poet.&nbsp; <br> <\/p>\n<p><b>Monthly Gatherings:<\/b> Some months will be focussed on certain themes (\"Love\", \"Benevolence\", \"the Magi\" etc.) and other months' will focused on a single poem. The meetings are limited to 8 members, and will take place at one of our area's many locations offering delicious Persian cuisine. &nbsp;In the company of friends and delectable food, this should be a good way to nourish our souls and our bellies at the same time! <br> <\/p>\n<p>Come with an open heart - an accessible \"heart\" is a key ingredient to experiencing Hafez. And of course, come with a healthy appetite. Hafez was a fan of experiencing the divine here on earth - and nourishing our sense, in this case, our tastebuds, are part of the experience of these gatherings!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Link to a feature on the Hafez class I used to teach:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.paaia.org\/CMS\/teaching-the-divan-of-hafez-one-ghazal-a-week.aspx\">http:\/\/www.paaia.org\/CMS\/teaching-the-divan-of-hafez-one-ghazal-a-week.aspx<\/a> <br> <\/p>\n<p><b>Afsaneh<\/b><\/p>\n<br>",

New to Meetup or Hosting please feel free to post game here.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Want to Host a game? - I am MORE THAN HAPPY to add ANYONE as an event organizer and you can host your own game, at anytime! The more hosts available, the better this group will be. Just message me if you would like to host a game. HOST RULES: No rake, No entry-fee collection of any kind, and No minors. Hosts are not to make any money off the job of hosting a game.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Code of Conduct - This poker group is a friendly game group (i.e. respect others and win &amp; lose with grace. If you are a guest in someone's home, act like it. If you RSVP yes, please actually attend. If you attend, leave your non-playing friends and family at home.) Any host has the right to ask you to leave if your negative behavior warrants that, and could result in a ban from that and all game locations. Pretty much just don't be a jerk.<\/p>",

        "description": "Rob LaPin is a true Progressive Democrat, a former Baltimore City Teacher, and US Veteran running for the Maryland House of Delegates in Baltimore, MD. Rob is the most progressive candidate in the 40th District fighting for education reform, a living wage, women's rights, marriage equality, greater gun control, and correction systems reform. To name a few. Rob believes that the term \"tough on crime\" should mean building a fully funded education program within Baltimore City, investing in after-school and work programs for youth, keeping recreation centers open, and protecting our open spaces. As the underdog in the race fighting against incumbent opponents who have done little in the past eight years to protect our progressive interests, supporting Rob's causes and helping him to gain votes in the district is a great way for all us to build a better, stronger, fair, and equitable Baltimore.",

Come experience positive interactions with mature, like-minded individuals raising their children independently in a positive environment. This playgroup is designed for parents to meet and enjoy play-dates and activities mainly with their children with occasional Parent Night Out events. Our goal is to encourage activities that promote and enhance social skills in order to foster long lasting friendships, for both children and parents. Please note: ALL parents are welcome to join the group and activities, however our focus is mainly to serve as a meet up to support single parenting... Although the dynamics are slightly different between those raising children solo and those doing it with a partner, or a mate, at the end of the day we all want healthy, strong and independent kids.",

        "description": "During a March 22, 2014 Discipleship class, my assignment was to talk about Queen Esther and how I related to her life in the bible. As You recall, Haman had a hatred for the Jews, and deceptively convinced the Persian king Ahasuerus   that the Jews needed to be exterminated. A decree was passed that this extermination would occur. However, Queen Esther being a Jew herself, with the guidance from Mordecai - asked all the Jews to Fast and Pray, before any she would take any action. During the  Discussion in my class - my question was to the group and they take this scenario and apply it to any issues that are happening today. One sister stated, yes,  the Stand Your Ground Law in Florida, where it is devised to imprision and or murder African Americans here in America.  We all agreed, it is the same situation, the Susan another one of the class participants said, \"We Need To Fast and Pray\" My heart just leaped! And So here is the beginnings of the Stand Your Ground WITH JESUS site. To pray and fast and then act. BUT Pray and fast first to the Lord, then ACT under the power of the Holy Spirit. Please join us if you feel lead by the power of the Lord Jesus Christ.",

They are all upbeat, pleasant and interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : 16px\">Since we are a fairly new group we are trying out different days, times and places to meet to make sure everyone finds a time and event that fits their schedule.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The atmosphere is very casual and super friendly. If you can't make a few meetups, that's fine. \u00a0We'll never drop a member for inactivity. \u00a0If you may be late, just let us know and we'll save you a seat. If I were to ask anything from you it would be your help by suggesting something you'd like to do.<\/p>\n<p>Join us, or come to a meeting for a visit to see how this group fits you.

These walks will be a fun time for all age groups of people and dogs--without taking too much time out of your day. We will hike at a pace that is good for all, stop to take photos, enjoy wildlife, and maybe let dogs swim a bit...depending on where we are. But I can't plan this group alone. I want to organize walks...but I want some fellow group leaders as well to organize\/share their favorite dog past-times that they feel others may enjoy. Truly seeking to make this a group effort with group input. What a great way for dogs and their owners to make new friends...while sharing similar interests. (All size dogs are welcome! And folks without dogs...who just like to be around dogs and fun people, and hike...are welcome too!) <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/8\/4\/600_348383172.jpeg\"><\/p>",

Rotaract clubs are either community or university based, and they\u2019re sponsored by a local Rotary club. This makes them true \"partners in service\" and key members of the Rotary family. As one of Rotary\u2019s most significant and fastest-growing service programs, with more than 7,000 clubs in about 163 countries and geographical areas, Rotaract has become a worldwide phenomenon. Locally, the Annapolis Rotaract Club serves the Greater Annapolis Area (including Crownsville) and all of Anne Arundel County. Serving the Internation community, Rotaract will plan volunteer service trips and hold event fundraisers for international projects. If you live or work in A.A. County, are a young professional or college student and are looking for a way to network while bettering our community and the world, join us for a meeting or check our calendar to see when and where you can find us around town. Meetings are the second Tuesday of every month at Federal House, 2nd Floor, at 7 pm and are open to anyone interested in Rotaract or in our speakers.",

Are you wishing you had some connections to inspire you to get better, play more, write a song, and just have some fun? I think there are a lot of us out there; playing in the living room but not connecting. Let's get together and swap licks, improvise over one another playing rhythm, learn songs, learn a new style, and laugh.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>This is not an open mic platform. This group is all about getting ourselves to building chops and getting from So So Good to Good to Great. Build confidence to take it wherever your aspirations take you.

Each meeting, held at 7PM on the first Tuesday of every month, is a great opportunity for anyone interested in learning more about real estate investing to get their questions answered by experts. In addition, the Quick Pitch - a regular part of every meeting - is a chance for any member to present deals, investment opportunities, and services.

Walked on the treadmill one too many times? Your body is probably so used to what you are doing that it hasn't changed in months. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result - STOP THE INSANITY! Ask yourself, \"Am I getting the results I want from my exercise routine?\" If the answer is \"no,\" or if you're just plain bored, our boot camp class is the solution for you! Many people strength train with weights while others do cardio or aerobics; our boot camp classes fall somewhere in between. Get the benefits of both. You'll get stronger, your cardiovascular fitness will improve, and you'll burn more calories! Watch your body change! Our boot camp classes are held indoors in our 2700 sq ft facility in Hanover, MD. This is a group class setting with a certified instructor using tools such as kettlebells, sand bags, ropes, medicine balls, suspension trainers, and other fun and different equipment! No matter if you are just starting out or if you've been working out for a while, this boot camp is for you. We accommodate all fitness levels - we guarantee you'll feel different, move different, look different and play different! This type of training is a great way to shake things up and give you a full-body workout, burn a ton of calories, and get your metabolism going. We can't give this workout enough justice in writing, you have to come and experience the fun for yourself!

I also have an 11 yr old daughter. I do workouts at home mostly and love to do walks and runs. I am really eager to meet with other moms in the area who want to get fit and are looking for an awesome support system to help them get there. I value the team I had for support when I decided to become healthy and fit but most of them live in NY and I need women who I am able to meet up with in the area. If this is something you are interested in then this is the group for you :) I am part of The Columbia Association as well and if you also have a membership maybe we can plan a time for the gym. I am open to ideas and would love group interactions and any idea you guys have please let me know :) with the same goals in mind I think we can really make a steady and lifelong change in our health and fitness together! Please msg me with any ideas for meetup days etc.<\/p>",

I am an avid traveler and owner of Ladybug Cruises, an independent \u00a0franchise of Cruise Planners, an American Express company. I will NOT try to sell at the meetups. It is against Meetup policy and in fairness to the other members, any personal business will have to be done before or after group time. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We'll plan land or cruise trips, for singles wanting to take advantage of singles specials fares or those who prefer to travel in a group for extra savings and perks, not to mention good company. \u00a0Sometimes we'll just talk about our memories or future plans. \u00a0We're just getting started, it's up to you the direction we go. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : 16px\">One thing I do know for sure, after 35 years of this, everyone has a different experience on every trip. \u00a0You can be laughing at the entertainer and the folks around you just stare straight ahead. Perhaps you think the food is killer and your tablemates turn up their noses. \u00a0One of my favorite destinations is not necessarily yours. \u00a0The best way to decide on your vacation is to gather as many bits of information about what matters to you, make a short list then get the lowdown about secret specials from a travel professional and choose which comes closest to your budget. \u00a0There are great tours and all-inclusives all over the world and we have members who have had extensive travel experiences to share tips.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : 16px\">An advantage of my affiliation is I have materials and brochures for you which are not handed out as liberally as in the past. \u00a0Where did all the travel agencies go?!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : 16px\">My goal is to to create a casual friendly atmosphere where the well traveled will swap stories and provide tips for those new to the cruise world. \u00a0If you love cruising, or want to dive in, please join us!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Again, request for brochures are welcome, simply email or message me destinations, lines or tours and I'll bring them to a meeting or mail them to you. \u00a0I have thousands, but on the off chance I don't have what you want, Ill get it for you.<\/p>\n<p>Please join us, the more the merrier!<\/p>",

Bishop Abrams is a Ph.D in ministry and theology and she desires to pour into all of you. This group will explore the Bible and its intersection with our sexuality and expressions of authenticity as LGBTQ Christians. Join us on this spiritual journey and create loving relationships anchored in God, filled with the Holy Spirit, and guided by the Love of Jesus Christ. We have worship services each Sunday at 1pm (that celebrates LGBTQ Christians), we have Word Wednesday Study by conference call each Wednesday at 7:30pm, and quarterly conversation sessions on Saturdays on different topics around LGBTQ and spirituality. <br> <\/p>",

Some of us are single moms, some of us are just single. Plain and simple...there is not enough time in the day, or places to go to meet the \"right one\" so we decided to create a place in hopes of connecting people together. Chemistry, attraction and common interest is where the magic starts. Looking pass the physical to the mental is where the real CONNECTION begins. Let's meet, date, and have fun. Only serious, mature, men and women welcome. If you are here to play games, or you aren't seriously looking for love then this may not be the meet up group for you. Thick Chicks Rock! <br> <\/p>",

Baltimore\/D.C. has so many unique opportunities for single people, but it can be quiet difficult to get a group of girls together for military or career-oriented women. I am in no way excluding non-military women. Any woman who is new to the area and just wants to go out for a fun night or just do girlie things, suggest away!!",

Our lives have been profoundly impacted by this work, and we host free events to generate interest in PAX workshops in Washington DC, Baltimore and Northern Virginia. PAX Programs is in the business of educating women about men. PAX, the Latin word for \u201cpeace\u201d - and also an acronym for Partnership, Adoration and Xtasy - creates peace between the sexes by providing unique and immediately useful information to women and men. Women will rediscover MEN with compassion, understanding and the ability to get what you need from them with less effort and more satisfaction for both of you.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>PAX\u2019s flagship program -- Celebrating Men, Satisfying Women\u00ae -- is a weekend educational workshop for women, which transforms the way women relate to men. It facilitates the reconciliation many women are seeking with men and outlines the skills necessary for women to realize powerful, satisfying relationships with all of the men in their lives. The Understand Men DC\/Baltimore PAX community also hosts co-ed events so men can join us and learn more about women and learn tools to experience more rewarding relationships with women. We hope to see you at an event!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/understandmendc\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/understandmendc<\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.understandmen.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.understandmen.com<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.queenscode.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.queenscode.com<\/a><br>\n\n<\/p>",

This group has 3 objectives: FRIENDSHIP, FUN, and all things FABULOUS! Members are called \"Bujhetto\" because we are not \"boojie\" (stuck-up &amp; stuffy) and we DISapprove of &nbsp;all things \"ghetto\" (LoLLL)...... We fall somewhere in the middle of those extremes, creating a happy, healthy medium ;) This group is about drawing QUALITY people..... <b>Quality over quantity.<\/b>&nbsp;We CONSISTENTLY have a BUNCH of downright AWESOME events, including:<\/p> \n<p><b>-FINANCE<\/b>: Homebuying, wealth-building\/ savings &amp; investment &nbsp;seminars<\/p> \n<p><b>-CULTURE<\/b>: Winetasting, film festivals, museums, sip &amp; paint events, restaurants featuring various ethnic cuisines..... I'm &nbsp;really great at finding great eats on the cheap! =)<\/p> \n<p><b>-TRAVEL<\/b>: From local weekend getaways...... to road trips &amp; international expeditions. &nbsp;A film festival in Martha's Vineyard &amp; Vegas are our first two slated trips!<\/p> \n<p><b>-ENTERTAINMENT<\/b>: &nbsp;We are BIG on posting Old School parties &amp; music ('60s- '80s), &amp; will be hosting events regarding golfing, jazz concerts, live music, comedy shows, amusement parks, paintball, Game Nights, BBQs, picnics in the park, etc.<\/p> \n<p><b>-HEALTH &amp; WELLNESS<\/b>: Hiking, gardening, \"How to Cook Healthy &nbsp;&amp; Yummy\" workshops, deals on yoga &amp; exercise classes, etc.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p><b>4 Simple Membership Guidelines&nbsp;<\/b><\/p> \n<p>1) Members <b>MUST<\/b> complete <b>ALL FOUR<\/b> of the intro questions &nbsp;<b>FIRST<\/b> in order to join &amp; have a REAL photo of themselves. &nbsp;All events are set to private so in case you have an online stalker, they won't be able to find you.... not &nbsp;through us at least! =)<\/p> \n<p>2)&nbsp;Members are to attend at least 1 meetup every 3 months. &nbsp;If you go missing that long, the Organizer or whomever you're close w\/ in the group will have called, text, emailed, or sent out a search party for you anyway. &nbsp; We're about building REAL &amp; sustaining friendships, remember? :)<\/p> \n<p>3) \"No Show\" Policy: 3 no shows in any 6 month period = removal from group. &nbsp;PLEASE take a brief moment to update your RSVP when you realize you won't be coming.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>4) Trial membership is free. &nbsp; You can pay when you join, but &nbsp;we won't even start the clock until you've gotten your FREE 60-day trial period in, after which unpaid trial members will be removed. &nbsp;<b>$10 is an extremely nominal fee to be a part of a group that has these caliber of events.<\/b> &nbsp;Besides, we are hecka fun. I do believe coming out to 1 or 2 &nbsp;events in that period will ensure you'll want to officially join :)&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>We are the DMV's Creme of the Crop..... In all things we do, we RISE TO THE TOP! ;)&lt;br&gt;<\/p>",

Este MeetUp es para Hispan@s que est\u00e1n casados o tienen como pareja a un americano, gringo, estadounidense o c\u00f3mo ustedes le llamen! ... El punto es convivir y mezclar nuestras culturas! hablar espa\u00f1ol para que ella o el aprenda y praticar nuestro ingles con ella o el! .. Formar amistades de parejas que puedan perdurar en esta ciudad tan atareada. Salir a comer o cenar, ir a visitar los vi\u00f1edos, organizar \"barbecues\", viajes, campamentos, ir festivales juntos, conciertos, actividades al aire libre, juntarnos a celebrar alguna importante fecha de nuestros pa\u00edses, organizar picnics, etc etc !! (cualquier idea es bienvenida). ****************************************************************************************************************************** I have decided to create this MeetUp because my husband and I love to go out but unfortunatley we don't have as much as friends as we would like to, he is from California, I am from Mexico, so both our families and friends are far away. This is a group for Hispanics that are married to Americans. The point of this gathering is to mix our culture and language, so he or she can learn spanish or practice their english. Create a couples friendship that can last in this busy city. We can go out for lunch and dinner, visit the vineyards, concerts, outdoor activities, barbecues, get together to celebrate an importante holiday of our countries, picnic, kayaking and biking, etc, etc! (any idea is welcome)<\/p>",

Are you looking to meet other young professionals in their 20's, 30's and some that are a little older, but are still young in spirit? This is the group for you!<\/p>\n<p>We are singles and couples looking to make some new friends, have good conversation and a fun time close to home. The type of events we do are: happy hours, picnics, hikes, viewing community theatre, comedy clubs and anything else members would like to organize. If you would like to host an event, please introduce yourself to the organizer at one of our meetups.<\/p>\n<p>You must be 21 or older to join and any guests you bring must also be 21 or older. This is not a singles\/dating group. It is a group to make friends. If your friendship turns into something more, that's great, but the primary purpose of this group is to have a good time with other like-minded people in a casual setting.<\/p>\n<p>To join, please answer all of the profile questions. Tell us a little about yourself, so that others can get to know you. YOU MUST POST A PHOTO OF ONLY YOU, THAT WE CAN SEE YOUR FACE. This is to help organizers identify members at events and so that other people in the group can get to know you.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks! Looking forward to meeting you soon!!!!<\/p>",

After deliberating for the past six months what direction we would like to lead this Meet-up Group in, the concept and strategy was born out of my role with N&amp;C, Inc and the project we launched using IBM\/Watson\u2019s cognitive computing systems to develop disruptive solutions in the regulatory space. As part of my firms launching of the Digital Baltimore campaign to create a cognitive computing hub for the nation by attracting new Tech Firms to Baltimore. These firms &nbsp;will boost the economy, create a new environment for developing human capital which means training people for the jobs that the tech industry will need for these firms to thrive.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>Our Meet-ups for the remainder of the year will be held at the Emerging Technology Center\u2019s Haven Campus in Baltimore. I will notify everyone this month on upcoming calendar of events, updates and Meetups. If you would like more information on our program please contact us through the messaging system.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>We have partnered with Amazon Web Services to develop a series of applications through our S.T.E.M. Program. This partnership gives us access to 21 different platforms offered by AWS including cloud services and storage. Their services will allow us to build a Big Data content hub as well as create and deploy cognitive computing systems and solutions.<\/p>\n<br>As initially announced at the formation of this meetup we will continue bringing together groups of practitioners, experts, researchers, students, and educators to get their input on how best to design this series of convenings such that they are impactful. We hope to convene a diverse group of stakeholders to these MBK events and would greatly appreciate your sharing this event with anyone you think might be able to provide a unique perspective or add value (be it through expertise, past experiences, or a current skillset).",

        "description": "<p><strong>**IMPORTANT: Please make sure you read through ALL of the description to see if this group is a fit for you, before requesting to join**<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><i>So I've been browsing through countless Meetup groups, and while they're all amazing, they weren't exactly what I was looking for (group events were too big-which can be intimidating if you don't know anyone, or not the right kind of events,\u00a0not the right age group, not the right location, etc). So I decided why not make my own and see if I get any interest! If you are:<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0<b>young<\/b> (in college, a recent grad, young professional, in your early 20s--most groups that are for \"20s or 20s &amp; 30s usually lean towards the older end of the spectrum-- or a kid at heart.)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0looking to meet new people &amp;; make friends (I know almost ALL groups say this, but what <strong>I<\/strong> mean is your looking for real, lasting friendships)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0new to the area looking for friends (I'm from this area originally but I lived in NJ for 5 years, so I haven't really been able to get around so sometimes I consider myself new too haha.)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0looking to explore (there's TONS of things to do in the area, and I always want to do them but don't have people to go with)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0looking to travel (how many times have you looked at those Groupon or LivingSocial or Travelzoo deals and thought I WISHH but no one would go with me!? Well now maybe you can meet your travel buddy!)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0into fandoms (whether it be tv shows- Any Game of Thrones fans?- or books-Harry Potter anyone?-or anything else and want to meet others with similar interests)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0looking to check off things from your bucket list<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0open minded, willing to try new things, and friendly, then this group is for you :)<\/p>\n<p>What makes this group different is that I will try to host a VARIETY of events. A lot of groups I see usually do the same kind of event. In this group, I want to do a little bit of everything! Some examples:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Happy hours<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Going out nights (to bars, lounges, clubs, etc)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Girls night every once in a while for the ladies (sorry gentlemen, I don't have a co-host who is a guy to have a guys night haha)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Music festivals or concerts<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Game nights<\/p>\n<p><span>\u2022\u00a0Themed get together (based on what we're all fans of!)<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Domestic travel: how about a trip to NYC for the weekend?! Or even the beach?<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Potentially international travel? (One day, we'll get there!)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Potlucks or picnics or bbqs OR f<span>un in the sun (games outside since its currently summer)<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Dinner and then out on the town<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Lasertag, bowling, paintball, firing range, etc<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Whatever is on Groupon haha<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0And general bonding sessions :)<\/p>\n<p>If any of this interests you, this group is for you.<\/p>\n<p>I'm just looking for others with similar interests of making real connections with people, wanting to make new friends to hang out with, and genuine friendships where we support and lift one another up (fostered through smaller group events when needed.)<\/p>\n<p>How this will work for now--since this is a new group--is the event will happen if it meets a certain minimum of people (it would suck to plan something and no one shows up :\/)<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0I'm also completely open to suggestions, since this is new and I'm new at it, I'd love to hear them!<\/p>\n<p>Thanks and hope you join and we meet soon<\/p>",

The event site is the Fair Hill Shopping Center...  Visitors are encouraged to walk around and take a look at the police, fire and business displays and visit with the community.  National Night Out not only brings the community together for fun and safety lessons, it is also a successful fund raiser.  Businesses donate items for popular \"paper bag raffle\".

        "description": "<p>Hey, I'm just a student and VERY new to sign language, but I joined other meetups and LOVE signing with others, it's just, we have to drive around 30 to 45 to get everywhere. So a couple of classmates asked if I would start one in Columbia. I am just mimicking other ASL groups and am still pretty new to the language. I only stay in MD during the summer so I will eventually ask one of my classmates to take over. Anyways, if you're interested in signing with me and a few friends we'd love the experience. Also, If anyone knows of events and wants us to create a meetup event for it we would be more than glad to, just email us the details.<\/p>",

        "description": "Comic Sutra The Game is an awesome new party game perfect for college students and young adults. Set the timer and couples\/teams take turns racing through as many funny and daring positions as possible before time runs out. There are enough cards for 5 couples to play three rounds. Whichever couple\/team successfully completes the most positions wins. Contents: 84 position cards, instruction card, timer instruction card, timer. High quality cards are printed on both sides so people in the room can also see the position you are trying to complete.   You only really need a couch, a floor, and a wall to play.  Game play is not creepy or perverted.  Fully clothed and tons of fun.  \n\nYou can check out a video of game play on YouTube at\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DI_k5XWSRTc\n\nWe would like to have a few parties to demonstrate the game and spread the word.  We would like to see if we can get enough of a following to have a few meetups and we will announce them shortly.",

Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud.\n\nLearn more about Docker at http:\/\/www.docker.com",

We welcome every type of person of every ability level to contribute and assist with the cleanup. Though it is true we will need people to dig out shopping carts and haul trash to the dumpsters, we need people to run water, food, tools, and trash bags (both empty and full) to individuals in the creek. People to sort recyclables from the debris removed. People will be needed to help at registration, setup food and snacks as well as many other less strenuous activities. We are also authorized to sign-off on Community Service and Service Learning Hours for students. The more people we have, the easier the work will be for everyone. We will provide lunch and snacks as well as gloves. A limited number of tools are available for sign-out, but suggest bringing your own if you have them. These cleanups are run in conjunction with the Ocean Conservancy, National Public Lands Day, American Rivers and Trash Free Maryland.",

        "description": "<p>In business, our relationships can make and cost us in three major areas:<\/p>\n<p>Time<br>\n\nMoney and<br>\n\nEnergy<\/p>\n<p>As entrepreneurs, artists and leaders, more time, money and energy can be the difference between success and failure, so maximizing our relationships can really benefit us, but we spend little time improving them and learning how we can make the most out of them. So, let's spend time together sharing our relationship issues and possibilities, working on them and benefiting from each others' as well. We'll make real progress on our relationships and ourselves that will make a difference in our businesses and our lives.<\/p>\n<p>We lose time and energy in heaps when our relationships aren't working as well as they can, whether they are professional or personal. When our relationships aren't working, we may be cranky, stressed, intimidated, disillusioned, vengeful, preoccupied and any of those things will affect our focus, resolve and our well-being. We won't be at our best and we'll wind up putting too much on ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>If you look closely, you'll see just how much money your relationships are costing you because you may not be taking necessary risks, you may be shut down in a particular area, you may be lacking the support you need and unwilling to reach out to resources or potential income that could be game-changing.<\/p>\n<p>For everyone in the world of startups, and that includes all creative people, like artists and musicians as well as people with private practices, like accountants and doctors, your relationships will also be vital when you start transitioning from the person with a dream to the person with a business, because things like delegation, workplace communication and collaboration become more vital than ever when you can't intimately oversee everything going on.<\/p>\n<p>If your personal relationships are not energy-providing, you may take your home issues to the office in the form of not having restful sleep, arriving already frustrated, spending time on \"work\" that could be spent on the relationship which can lead to diminishing returns, etc. All of our relationships contribute to the person we are being for our business, whether we are putting our best foot forward and being the leaders we need to be for the success of our endeavor. If those relationships are working, it feels like all of our energies are going in the same direction, which can bring huge time and energy gains from feeling understood, supported and appreciated for who we are and for our choices.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, there's our relationships with ourselves, which couldn't be more vital. How much we trust ourselves, believe that what we're up to is valuable, feel connected to our work and feel appreciated for our work can make such a difference. This can determine whether we show up as an exciting and magnetic maverick, a tiresome techie, or just self-involved. An empowered relationship with ourselves can be a great asset at the moment(s) of truth for your business.<\/p>\n<p>We'll work on all of these vital elements of our business relationships via meeting topics like: What are you Worth?, Disabling your Distractions, The Distortion of Fear, (Re)Defining Success, Building Relationships that Pay and Treating Yourself Right, to name a few.<\/p>\n<p>I look forward to leading us through this process together in a way that will hopefully profit you greatly.<\/p>",

S.W.O. was co-founded by Carlos Christian. .<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>At the age of 13, Carlos got involved into the drug trade which led to a 10-year prison sentence. He was incarcerated at The Marion Correctional Institution in Marion, Ohio from ages 19 to 29. During his sentence, Carlos dedicated himself to rehabilitation and being a positive role model for his community. Carlos graduated from Marion Technical College majoring in Business Management with a 3.83 GPA. In addition he successfully completed an Administrative Office Technology vocational program. Upon release Carlos had support from his friends, family, and a case manager from the halfway house he was released to. His friends and family helped him out with clothing and transportation assistance and the case manager referred him to employment after his many unsuccessful attempts. After he obtained employment, housing, and his own transportation; Carlos relocated to Columbus, Ohio where he went on to homeownership, custody of his son, and mentoring currently incarcerated individuals in penitentiaries and county jails. .<\/p>\n<p>During Carlos\u2019 prison sentence he realized that he had more examples of individuals being released from prison and returning than he had examples of individuals being released from prison and going on to lead positive lives in the community. It is because of his determination to help currently incarcerated men build the same solid foundation pre and post release as he did that S.W.O. was formed. The organization is founded on the principal that individuals must Start Within themselves and Start Within their current situations. The organization takes a holistic approach to reentry providing programming for incarcerated men, their significant other, and their children. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>\n<br>",

As a result, many members of our community do not receive the help they need to cope with their illness. Because of the stigma associated with mental illness in minority communities, many suffer quietly and alone. This group provides support for those minorities who suffer from a mental illness-namely bipolar and depression. Our group is also open to families and friends of minorities with bipolar or depression. Our purpose is two-fold: 1. We aim to provide support through fellowship in a variety of ways-whether through talk sessions, a Sunday afternoon BBQ, or a volunteering event. 2. Help to raise awareness of mental illness in minority communities in an effort to erase the stigma associated with it. As an African American woman diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I have dealt with many challenges associated with the disease-from strained and broken relationships to problems on the job. After a life changing event that left me lonely and in a financial bind, I decided that I would no longer allow my illness to control my life. I was determined to fight back. And no better way is there to fight back than to join others with bipolar or depression for fun and fellowship. Please note, we are not licensed professional therapists and we do not offer or provide professional mental health services. However, we will share with you various resources that can help you on your road to recovery. So, join us, and always remember, no one should fight harder for your life than you!<\/p>",

Mindfulness meditation is not just practiced on the cushion, through sitting meditation, but it is incorporated in all that we do in our daily lives, moment by moment. In mindfulness we learn to clear our minds, open our hearts, and live life fully through our bodies. Through this process we open up to a greater sense of wholeness and wellbeing within ourselves and a vast connectedness with others and the world. As we build the muscles of mindfulness meditation, we live more fully in the present moment and experience life from a greater stillness, which aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety, and stress. Thirty years of research has indicated that mindfulness meditation is associated with significant decreases in stress, pain, physical and emotional distress (including depression, anxiety, grief and loss), and improvements in sleep, energy, health outcomes, and quality of life.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>TEACHERS:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n <b>NANCY BRUTSCH\u00c9, MSN, RN, PMHCNS-BC<\/b><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/a\/c\/event_177556812.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px\" height=\"160\" width=\"149\"><\/p>\n<p>I am a board certified Clinical Nurse Specialist and psychotherapist with 30 years experience in health and wellness and a specialty in mood and anxiety disorders.

        "description": "<p>My Fellow Marylanders,<\/p> \n<p>It\u2019s time to face some unpleasant facts. &nbsp;Both the State of Maryland and the United States Federal Government have become unrecognizable. &nbsp;Unaccountable government, at all levels, continues to grow by leaps and bounds. &nbsp;We now live in a high-tech surveillance police state. &nbsp;Without the founding principles of individual freedom, our government engages in endless activities that rob us of those freedoms one regulation and law at a time. &nbsp;In addition, this lack of principle promulgates foreign policy decisions that are making the world less safe, both for American's at home and abroad. &nbsp;Drones and surveillance systems have become the norm and only minimal or token efforts are made to protect American's rights of privacy.<\/p> \n<p>Additionally, there are targeted assassinations, kill lists, the abandonment of due process and habeas corpus, the inculcation of paranoia and fear in the population, massive snitching and entrapment industries, uncontrolled borders and uncontrolled immigration (endorsed and promoted by D.C and Annapolis), a crumbling infrastructure, a gutted industrial base, and financial bankruptcy with the \u2018banksters and gangsters\u2019 in power plundering the working and middle class. &nbsp;Immorality and evil have replaced traditional values and the Bill of Rights, while extreme violence is considered 'Politics' and promoted ceaselessly as long as it supports an 'Approved' agenda. &nbsp;Even our Constitutional First and Second Amendment rights are under open and sustained attack.<\/p> \n<p>Sadly, most in leadership positions, of BOTH parties, are fully supportive of using their power to enrich themselves and their crony friends. &nbsp;They take turns sharing the spoils of power while shutting out all those who are not a direct part of their political machine. &nbsp;Marylanders have been sold out over and over again by politicians who only care about lining their own pockets. &nbsp;It\u2019s time to break up the Elitist monopoly and return America to Americans and Maryland to Marylanders. &nbsp;It's time to fight for our state and our country, restoring its promise and potential to all citizens.<\/p> \n<p>&nbsp;Our Principles:<\/p> \n<p>1. Spending money you don't have is a recipe for disaster. Thus, we believe in FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY.<\/p> \n<p>2. More government is rarely the solution to a problem. Thus, we believe in LIMITED GOVERNMENT.<\/p> \n<p>3. Each individual must acknowledge primary responsibility for his own well-being and that of his family. Thus, we believe in PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY<\/p> \n<p>4. Every judge and prosecutor has a duty to apply the law as it is written, not as he or she wishes it could be. Thus, we believe in THE RULE OF LAW.<\/p> \n<p>&nbsp;5. The people, as individuals, and as members of each state and nation should determine for themselves the laws which will govern their lives. Thus, we believe in SOVEREIGNTY.<\/p> \n<p>&nbsp;If you believe that Maryland is worth fighting for, and that America is worth fighting for, join us.<\/p>",

Well, let's just say, I'd be better off explaining that over a bottle of Moscato.<\/p>\n<p>After my marriage of 15 years came to an end, I found myself single but not so ready to mingle. I did not want my next relationship to end in failure but the men I gravitated to only met my requirements for the moment; not a lifetime.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span>Was something wrong with me? Are all the good men gone? It took me awhile but I realized the problem wasn't them; it was me. How could I recognize a king when I had a hard time understanding that I Am Queen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This group is for those 30+ single women who dream, hustle &amp; love hard while waiting for their king to arrive. I truly believe a woman's picture of herself is reflected in the type of man she dates. So, who's loving you? \u00a0<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Let's prepare ourselves to become better rulers of our throne. So, we can bring more than a plate to the table.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We'll start on the journey of self-discovery while building genuine friendships in a drama free environment. You'll enjoy great conversations, fun-filled gatherings, and unique experiences all designed to make us stronger women; mind, body &amp; soul.<\/p>\n<p>Kings are highly encouraged to join us. While this is not a dating meet up group, we do recognize the importance of building healthy relationships with men without the pressure of finding \"the one\". Sometimes, Queens just want to have fun in the company of Kings.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<br>",

We take a deep dive into your specific message, then break it down to its core and re-engineer it in a way that makes it easy to understand and more meaningful. Ultimately you leave the workshop with a blueprint for sticky messaging.<\/p>\n<br>",

I am also a certified P-ESL (Pronouncing English as a Second Language) Instructor having completed my training with The Institute of Language &amp; Phonology. I am also the owner of Speech Therapy Enterprises LLC wherein I work with a multitude of communication cases. There are many reasons why people want to learn the \u201cEnglish Pronunciation\u201d of language. Foreign born speakers of the English language have to navigate socially and professional while living in America. For some, it is critical to speak the English language with clarity in order to obtain or keep a professional job. Enhance your telephone speaking skills or professional presentation skills. Some ESL (English as a Second Language) speakers need to reduce their accent in order to increase their income. Reduce the accent, not the pay. Learn to \u201cCode Switch\u201d between meeting with friends to meeting with co-workers to increase understanding. For whatever reason you\u2019ve come to review the Bowie Accent Modification Classes\/English Pronunciation announcement, it will be well worth your time. Enjoy the journey and have fun with one on one and sometimes group classes. Screenings are free! I will assess your speech &amp;\u00a0 language skills via a link at my website and you can have a consultation with me to discuss aspects of your current communication skills. <b>Subsequent classes require a fee for services<\/b> that will be well worth your investment. Payment plans are also available when needed. <a href=\"http:\/\/speechtherapyenterprisesllc.com\/accent-reduction\/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/speechtherapyenterprisesllc.com\/accent-reduction\/<\/a><\/p>",

They are not required to bring food to meetings, but may do so if they wish, and may be able to receive a payment toward the cost of ingredients. \u00a0 This is also for\u00a0eating together, socializing, and mutual support where people can talk honestly about their challenges, barriers, and successes.\u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>COACHES<\/b> are those who would like to offer support to participants, and should have some experience in preparing healthy, plant-based food with minimal if any salt, sugar or oil. \u00a0Prospective coaches would attend support meetings and eventually determine if they would like to join the team by serving as a coach over a period of time. \u00a0Coaches are not necessarily experts in plant-based cooking or nutrition, but have some amount of passion for helping others to move in this direction, and are able to provide helpful tips and pointers for participants. \u00a0Some coaches will be motivated by the prospect of getting support and inspiration for themselves. \u00a0If needed, coaches may be able to receive a payment toward the cost of ingredients.\u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><span><b>HELPERS<\/b> are those who are part-way on their journey, \u00a0able to prepare some healthy plant-based food with minimal if any salt, sugar or oil, who can give some advice and encouragement to others, but are still on the path of learning. \u00a0 If needed, helpers may be able to receive a payment toward the cost of ingredients.\u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>SUPPORT MEETINGS:<\/b> \u00a0Twice a month. \u00a0We hope that most people will be regular Participants, learning more over time, with a smaller number of Coaches and Helpers. \u00a0 Coaches, helpers (and Participants if they want) bring potluck dishes to share. \u00a0There is usually a presentation about nutrition or food preparation, often a guest speaker or excerpt from a video, \u00a0plenty of discussion about barriers and successes, with sharing of ideas and recipes. \u00a0*Useful kitchen items and copies of DVDs will be available at every meeting for sale <i>at cost<\/i> (no profit will be made).<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>\"TICKETS\":<\/b>\u00a0 \u00a0Space is limited. \u00a0An invitation (\"ticket\") is required. \u00a0 We'll have a list of invitees so there is no need to bring a paper ticket. \u00a0 Send a request to attend by email WITH YOUR PHONE NUMBER and contact information and we will get back with you with the exact time and date. \u00a0Some invitations (\"tickets\") that are good for one or two months at a time. \u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>FREE CONSULTATION<\/b> from Joseph A. Adams M.D. can be provided individually at support meetings, free of charge, for participants. \u00a0This is not medical advice, just coaching and nutrition information. \u00a0\u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>INTRODUCTORY MEETINGS: \u00a0<\/b> To be scheduled periodically, date, location and frequency to be determined. These will be open to the public, scheduled in or around the Park Heights area. \u00a0All are welcome, free of charge. \u00a0These are outreach meetings to inform neighbors about the Nutrition As Medicine program. \u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><span><b>DRAMATIC HEALTH BENEFITS: \u00a0<br>\n\n<\/b> For people who want to lose weight, or treat and prevent heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, and many many other health challenges.\u00a0 It\u2019s also for anyone who wants to try fabulous new plant-based recipes that are more delicious, and easy to prepare, than they ever imagined. It\u2019s for people who like to taste a new recipe before they go to the trouble of preparing it themselves.\u00a0<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n Dr. Joe maintains a website of favorite recipes (www.NutritionAsMedicine.org), and can answer questions about nutrition, health, and medication.\u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Just as people need support from N.A. or A.A. to overcome dependence on drugs or alcohol, people also need support to get into \u201crecovery\u201d from chicken wings, pizza, and the S.A.D. (Standard American Diet). \u00a0 It is possible to experience a transformation, and your taste buds <i>will<\/i> change as you learn to appreciate the taste of real food.\u00a0 Once people discover that healthy food is fabulous, many can completely get off some or all of their pills for diabetes, high blood pressure, and other health conditions. \u00a0<\/p>",

Just wanted to let you all know that I will be planning out some dates for us to have some outdoor hoop jams, sorry there has been a delay in scheduling this, I promise some events will come soon!<\/p>\n<p><span>Meet up with other hula hoop dancers, doesn't matter if its your first time picking up a hoop or you've been hooping for years, come to learn, teach and have fun! Bring your own hoop or if you don't have one don't worry I'll bring extras.&nbsp;<\/span> <br> <\/p>\n<p><span>Hooping is a very special type of dance. Moving within a circle creates a sphere of light around you, allowing energy flow and healing. Its an incredible way to heal from anxiety and let go of pain and self doubt, its litterally impossible to hoop without smiling! When you let go and allow yourself to move you will feel a connection to your body and soul. It brings us back to a sense of play, a joy we have as chilren but loose as adults, its an incredible to just have fun again! It has been such a large part of my healing path I want to bring people together to experiance the joy of hooping.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Hoop dance is also an incredible workout, do you hate going to the gym? I do! You won't beleive how fun it is to workout with the hoop! Keep up the practice and watch your belly slim down and your arms get really toned! Did I mention cardio?!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>",

This group will be for people who value and view Ethiopian philosophy and politics combined.<\/p>\n<p>Events held in this group are all about life and happiness on Planet Earth and thereafter. This Meetup group is created by ABR Partners to bring community together on the basis of Zere Zera Yacob philosophy. Zera Yacob was an Ethiopian philosopher who lived in the 15th Century. He was a contemporary of Descartes, a French philosopher who lead England and France in new way of knowledge. However, Zera Yacob's Method of knowledge of God, of Human and the duties of Man was sharply different from Descartes.<\/p>\n<p>It is true that Descartes became the founder of modern philosophy of Science in which God is disclosed through intelligence whereas for Zera Yacob God is revealed through Natural Reason.There lies their difference. Yacob's Method of Natural Reason is a common sense which is equivalent to today's digital age.<\/p>\n<p>The Digital Age like the Age of the Renaissance \u00a0is blooming but the communication to the <i><b>Heart and the Mind is not.<\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><b>This group is about Methods of Natural Reasoning in a way of cultivating citizens mindset in global world based on local community.<\/b><\/i><\/p>",

Church On the Square is located at the East end of O'Donnell Square, and it's a new endeavor to provide opportunities for the community to get together. After the jam, we'll hit one of the bars on the square for drinks and conversation.",

Members attend with the intention and goal of learning how they can help other members in the group.

We believe that if everyone in the group brings this attitude to each and every meeting, everyone\u2019s businesses will benefit. Only one representative from an Industry may be represented in the group. Each of us is accountable to the group and if we miss more than two meetings without a good reason, our spot will be open to new members in respective industry.

The focus of our ongoing activity-based monthly Meetup will be to explore our feelings and motivations toward adapting a healthier lifestyle. We will learn to be more loving and accepting of ourselves so setting and implementing goals for health improvement are realistic and can be accomplished. We will learn how to make changes to suit our lifestyles, how our thought patterns sabotage our goals of being healthy, then make reasonable plans to accomplish our goals.&nbsp;<\/p>",

We are trans inclusive and LGBTQIA affirmative. We believe in remembering the past struggle, acknowledging our ancestors, and continuing the work that must be done to free our people.<\/p> \n<p>We believe in amplifying the voices of the marginalized within our community. Our primary focus is serving youth within the community, making sure they have the resources they need to do well and excel. <\/p> \n<p>\"\u2026For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house\u2026<\/p> \n<p>They may allow us to temporarily beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change. And this fact is only threatening to those women who still define the master's house as their only source of support.\" ~Audre Lorde<\/p> \n<p>In the spirit of our ancestors and elders Audre Lorde, Baynard Rustin, Maya Angelou, Miss Major Griffin Gracy, and so many more, we stand firm in working toward the change we wish to see. Any efforts made toward freedom cannot be successful if we do not acknowledge the multi faceted nature of the struggle. Audre Lorde has said, \"There is no such thing as a single issue struggle because we do not live single issue lives.\" <\/p> \n<p>The sole purpose of the group is to create a space for members to actively engage in culturally sensitive community service projects and programs to benefit Baltimore's youth and young adults. While we engage in community service projects, we also fight for social justice, and we work to provide educational opportunities for our people.<\/p> \n<p>If you are able to work with us in organizing projects for the community, please join us!<\/p>\n<br>\n<p><br><\/p>",

By bringing awareness and attention to how we take care of ourselves, we learn that it is possible to alleviate or eliminate many chronic illnesses. We are a caring, supportive group that shares stories, experiences, ideas and factual information about the latest findings and advances in the field of alternative medicine and nutrition.

We are interested in building community and encouraging supportive friendships among LGBT families with school-aged children. However, LGBT parents of all ages and stages are welcome to join. We are also members of the fantastic Maryland LGBT Parent Meetup, but the sheer number of members in that group (which is wonderful!), along with the vast geographic variety of members, has not allowed us to build close friendships within our immediate community. For this group, we are interested in building connections between LGBT parents in Annapolis, Arnold, Bowie, Crofton, Davidsonville, and the greater Annapolis area. Meetup events will include events for both children and parents, as well as gatherings for parents only.<\/p>",

Are you an introvert? &nbsp;Often times, joining a group can be daunting for those who are shy or introverted because you worry that someone may misinterpret who you really are. This is a group for women who are looking to make new connections but may be alittle on the shy side. This group will serve as a support group for anyone who is ready to make new friends and step out of their comfort zones! But all without the pressure of feeling misunderstood by our extroverted friends. We will meet once a week at a nearby location and share our thoughts, experiences and interests. We will incorporate indoor and outdoor activities (movies, dinner, shows, picnics) as a way of getting to know one another.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Since I bought my first iPad in April 2010, it opened the door to the idea called 'Life Hack', basically imporving productivity in both in your work and life. I tried a local mobile device user support group for over a year and a half. Eventually, I was very frustrated and gave up. I realized that I should create my own \u2018life hack for mature women\u2019 system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My intention is to share the result of what I learned and am still learning after reading 30+ books and over 1000 blog posts and tried over 300 apps. This is not about \u2018multi-tasking\u2019 or mobile device overload. This is about getting more things done while decreasing anxiety and stress Finally this is about being productive at any age while keeping the balance in life with our peers.<\/p>\n<p>Let's me explain what 'iTracking Party ' stands for.<\/p>\n<p>1. &nbsp;'i' &nbsp;stands for cloud and to the extent mobile devices. &nbsp; We will learn how to take advantage of cloud computing and mobile devices. &nbsp;The nut shell is to be able to access your important 'unique' information wherever you are.<\/p>\n<p>2. &nbsp;'Tracking', the most important habit we need to creat is to track as much activity as possible. &nbsp;This is where moble divices become very handy.<\/p>\n<p>3. &nbsp; 'Party'; &nbsp;do you know a single biggest reason why people procasitnate? Isolation !!, Yes, if you are normal human being, it is almost impossible to do it alone. &nbsp;Making new habits and stopping bad and old habits are so hard &nbsp;if you do it alone. &nbsp;However, if you have someone to do it together, &nbsp;it becomes doable.<\/p>\n<p>This is why I try to make 'local small groups'. &nbsp;Then within those groups , we can work together.<\/p>\n<p>Let me know if you want to start a new local group. &nbsp;I will facilitate any group which have more than 2 people.<\/p>",

        "description": "Interested in reading pro-women and feminist books but don't know much about feminism itself? Good, neither do I. If the most you know about feminism is that Taylor Swift and Lena Dunham seem to be all about it, or that Aziz Ansari now understands feminism because of his new girlfriend, then this may be the book club for you. If you Googled the definition of feminism and went, oh, yeah, that makes sense, this group may appeal to you. If you generally think feminism sounds like a good idea but you don't want to be hit over the head with college textbook-style reading choices, definitely join. I'm keeping this to women in their 20s and 30s to keep the group size manageable.",

Are you in your 20\u2019s\/30\u2019s and a newbie to the area or maybe just looking to meet some new people and expand your friendship base? We\u2019re a bit of both \u2013 I moved to Fed Hill last year and Tara has been in Fed for 2 years. I'm sure you would agree Baltimore has a lot to offer and we plan to take advantage of as many fun opportunities as possible - focusing mainly on Fed Hill &amp; Harbor East areas but also throwing in some other events out of the area here and there - festivals, vineyards, ziplining, tubing, etc!! We both enjoy happy hours (or drinks in general, regardless of the title lol), brunches, dinners out, festivals, fun runs, dancing, concerts, local events, themed parties\/events, pub crawls, weekend getaways aaaaaand so on and so on \u2013 basically anything fun and we\u2019re in! We\u2019d love to meet some other ladies who share the same interests and are looking to build new friendships while taking on the town. We both work full-time so most events will happen on weeknights or weekends. Can\u2019t wait to meet you ladies soon!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>",

A movement towards a new generation of \"whole black women who are EMPOWERED in every area of their lives. Whole women make SMART decisions and know their value. We refer to ourselves as Diamonds and we are priceless! We bring out the BEST in each other! We plan events that cater to EVERY aspect of your life. We workout together, travel together, save and invest together, pray together, solve problems together. We encourage and RESPECT our sisters at all times This group will strengthen your finances, your relationships, your health and emotional well-being and your spirit. We don't plan events, we create experiences. Designed to help you grow, explore the unique and live OUTSIDE \"the box\". Deep, introspective and amazing!...Not for EVERYONE...only women who want to be wiser, stronger, smarter...who are bold enough to SAY...I WANT MORE. More money, more respect, more love, more self-worth, more adventures, more of ME! My best self. When you bring your best self to every situation, you have the confidence to demand MORE. We limit our group numbers and focus on growth from the INSIDE out. We want active, committed members who ADD to the warm loving supportive atmosphere that we create at our events. We will be leaving meetup soon and expanding. Going National, as we will be featured in a book that we expect to be a National best seller. We have done a documentary and a talk show and our message is clear, BLACK WOMEN WANT MORE...and we will not settle for less than all of the best that life has to offer. If the group is closed, please email me to be added to the waiting list. As inactive and non committed members are removed, new members are added. We hope to MEET you soon... Black Women Who Want more are Spiritually grounded, emotionally stable, physically fit, financially poised, intellectually enlightened, politically conscious, socially gracious, black women who want more, demand more, deserve more of all of the best that life has to offer, on our journey to our best self.....<\/p>",

I am a Pa born, now Marylander ... Lived here a long time and find it's a tough area to meet people if you were not born here. I love football, animals, dinner, wine, pot lucks, reading,travel, hiking, just about anything... Most importantly, sincere women that care about each other and can support each other during times of need. Fun times are easy... But we know, life happens and sometimes you just need a friend... Other than your significant other or husband. This is my first club...and I was informed by some of the girls that I should add a no show policy...my rookie mistake;). I know plans change and lives are busy There is usually a waiting list for these functions so please be courteous to the other women and the restaurant\/venue by updating meet up or texting me. I don't want to be a meanie... But I will establish the three strikes you are out rule. It is for the respect of everyone and no one is too busy for an update message or text.

        "description": "<p>I am creating a men's Compline choir to chant the ancient monastic service of Compline. This will take place on Sunday nights with a rehearsal at 7 pm, and then chanting Compline at 8 pm. Taking place at Church on the Square (on ODonnell Square in Canton), we need male singers with an interest in Gregorian Chant and an interest or experience in reading traditional four-line chant notation. No particular spiritual background is necessary. Commitment is flexible, week-by-week participation is OK. There is no expectation of religious affiliation or any sort of involvement in any worship community. This is a uniquely Christian experience, but people from all kinds of spiritual journeys have found Compline to be rewarding and enriching because of its meditative, mystical, and centering qualities. Check it out sometime. \u00a0<\/p>",

The purpose of this group is to find Young at Heart, Single, Black, Working, Men without Kids 40 years and older&nbsp;in the DC, MD, and VA area to connect with each other and other groups of people. This non co-ed group is as private as Meetup.com will allow it to be.<\/p>\n<p><b> [PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE CLICKING JOIN-Best read from desktop site-plus videos]<\/b> Just because the&nbsp;men in the group currently do not&nbsp;have kids, it doesn\u2019t mean the men in the group will not&nbsp;have wives and kids in the future. Just as, some may not want them in the future. If you\u2019ve read this far and still have a smile on your face; hopefully, you fit all attributes and this group is for you.<\/p>\n<p><b>Type of Events: <\/b><\/p>\n<p>The group is designed so a person can find one person to roll with or grab the fellas. It\u2019s&nbsp;the perfect group for someone new in town looking to&nbsp;make new&nbsp;friends who have lived in the area for a while. The type of events this group does are completely up to the male&nbsp;members whether that be:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Sporting , golfing, and&nbsp;fishing&nbsp;events <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Networking, men\u2019s fellowship, and dating and relationship discussions <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Career specific, tech, empowerment, wellness, health,&nbsp;&nbsp;and fitness&nbsp;conferences <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Night life, themed night out, &nbsp;single events, and live music events <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Happy hour, wine,&nbsp;dining out and poetry events <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Road dog for annual events, workout partners,&nbsp; and mentors\/mentees collaborations&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Travel, volunteer work,&nbsp;and home improvement projects, <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Supporting an event, creating a team, or Whatever.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s your group so you decided if want to stay in and play spades or even put on a suit and crash a party with the fellas. The goal is for trustworthy people with different personalities to come together and have fun times.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Preference for the Men's Childfree Group: <\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>\u2022&nbsp;Never married biologically born males who have never had kids <\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>\u2022 Ages 40-50 years young but all ages&nbsp;38 and over are free to join. <\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>\u2022 Divorced folks won't be turned away- just make sure the&nbsp;IRS thinks you're single (and God knows you are single)<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u201cNo kids\u201d means no child has ever crawled around with your passed down DNA or you have never knowingly impregnated anyone in the last 10 months. It doesn\u2019t mean the kids don\u2019t live with you. If you click the join button, then go out and get married or impregnate somebody, you no longer fit the attributes of people in the group but the bonds you made in the group should continue in or out of the meetup. This group gives members a platform without judgment because your peers have similar stories.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t Feel You Fit in this Group: &lt;br&gt; If you do not fit all of the listed attributes above, there are many meetups to join that don\u2019t put you in a box so they may suit your needs better. Or, you might want to consider creating your own meetup group. However, this group will have some events inclusive to all as Society isn\u2019t made up of the same types of people.

The organizer is looking for Male&nbsp;Assistant Organizers to help run the group&nbsp;because the organizer does not plan to create events for the group without a male event host.

We continue to schedule films weekly in the Baltimore area followed by a meal and lively and informative conversation, encouraging attendees to offer their honest critiques. Your film, venue and schedule suggestions are welcome and encouraged. We have also already hosted several private potluck screenings in organizer and member homes in Camden, Little Italy, Reisterstown, and Columbia so be on the lookout for additional options.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As always, visiting our site will give you a snapshot of new Independent &amp;amp; Foreign films and classic or cult film revivals coming to town. We'll always provide linked excerpts to thought-provoking reviews, and trailers to pique your interest. Not to mention we'll continue to offer occasional FREE passes to pre-release screenings. With all that in mind, welcome and have a seat with us. In the words of Roger Ebert, \"[t]he movies are like a machine that generates empathy.&nbsp; It lets you understand a little bit more about different hopes, aspirations, dreams and fears. It helps us to identify with the people who are sharing this journey with us.\" This group's purpose is to bring together people to reflect on filmed artifacts of these journeys.<\/p>",

        "description": "The Baltimore-Washington C3D User Group strives to create a network that promotes the sharing of ideas and experiences among the membership in the Baltimore Washington metropolitan area.  We also promote a continued effort to educate ourselves about the ever-evolving universe of Autodesk\u2019s AutoCAD Civil 3D and its supporting programs.  The user group is at its founding stage and is looking for C3D users of all levels who would like to increase their knowledge of the program through activities, both fun and educational, with other users.  We are looking for people who are interested in participating at all levels, from wanting to sit in the corner and listen to being a member of the Board of Directors.  Right now, meetings will be held in Laurel, Maryland, but they can vary based on the planned activity and the membership.  We hope you can join us!",

Anyone can suggest activities; Even though this is geared towards night life, hiking, games, adventures, and group trips are strongly encouraged. I started this group in hopes that everyone would no longer stay at home and social network on the internet and instead meet people face to face. No group hating here, I want all groups of people to learn from each other and just go out and have fun. I will likely start by posting events I'm going to, or get invited to every week, so I hope you all will too.",

Also, be active in community and do some things like stream cleanups, etc (not mandatory), so this primarily an informal lacrosse toss around, but if you're interested in doing some good, you can. It will be the first of its kind. - TF<\/p>",

Cocktails will be served first. <br>-If you do not drink this is still a good time to socialize and meet new people who naturally love food and like things- After fraternizing, we will give you the ability to sample new food at low prices outside the traditional restaurant experience. The supper club is fantastic for networking, getting jobs, contacts and even romance. Whether you\u2019re bringing together friends or looking to make new ones The advantage lies in that you have time to get to know other people and a fun way to meet new people. <\/p>",

Futsal is a fast indoor soccer game played on a court with a smaller ball that promotes more creativity and technical ability. Though pick-up cost is $5, this meetup group will serve as a means for those who have an interest in learning and playing more futsal to meet and create a group in a local community. Flat are required as this is a brand new Taraflex hard court that is easy on the knees. Days will vary from later weekday nights to various weekend times. Anyone may attempt to coordinate a game and a court can even be reserved for free if there are enough players from the group. Hope to see you on the court!",

In this group we will have bible study, attend workshops and engage in social outings such as dining out at least once every 4- 6 weeks. Our focus will be understanding our \"Season of Singleness\" and its importance, and becoming the Proverbs 31 Woman. We are simply about empowering women with tools to help them maintain a life pleasing to God while in their singleness! \"Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, but a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised\".

This group was created for the same reason Meetup was created \u2013 to build a sense of community. With the DC area being such a transient community and as a transplant myself, I\u2019ve gone through the cycle of making good friends only to see them move to another city several times. The group is diverse and our ages range from 21 to 60. Our community is open to everyone, but most people reside along or near the Route 1 corridor (aka Baltimore Avenue or Washington Blvd) in Maryland (Ellicott City, Columbia*, Elkridge, Burtonsville, Beltsville, Catonsville, Laurel, Jessup, Maryland City, Hyattsville, Greenbelt, Bowie, College Park, Silver Spring). Our community includes single, married, and those with families. We do a variety of activities (HH, shopping, Guys or Girls\u2019 Night Out, pet sitting, play dates for kids, traveling, game nights, book club, ride to airport, etc.) As always, you should be cautious and meet in public first. Everyone will need to post a photo. If three members complain, you will be removed from the group. The bottom line is if you are young at heart, active, and looking for friends or to expand your circle of friends, you have found the right place.<\/p>",

This Meetup is unique because our goal is to be a community force guiding Owings Mills residents in promoting community development by building strong community bonds by:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0supporting local businesses and retailers,\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0educating and working with pubic officials, and\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0strengthening families by creating a safe, healthy and happy community of residents!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s brainstorm to host a multitude of events, community meetings, family activities, health groups, and special interests to premiere Owings Mills as the next Best Community on the East Coast.\u00a0<\/p>",
