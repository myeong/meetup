        "description": "<p>The Bushy Run Battlefield annual reenactment is August 1st and 2nd. There will be two battle reenactments each day. The one in the morning will take place around 11 a.m. and the one in the afternoon will begin at 2 p.m.<\/p> <p>Those will feature reenactors recreating the actions that occurred 252 years ago and changed the face of the relationship between the British and the Native Americans.<\/p> <p>During the day when the battle reenactment is not going on the reenactors will be in their camps and will be more than willing to answer questions about the role they play and the period they are demonstrating.<\/p> <p>In addition to that we will have a children's area where period games will be taught and the children can do crafts. The museum will also be open to all attendees. Guides will be available to talk to you about some of the artifacts in the museum and there will be some artists on site to discuss their art.<\/p> <p>On Saturday we will also be having wargaming demonstrations of the Battle of Bushy Run. There will also be a dedication of the Byerly Trail at 12:30.<\/p> <p>On Sunday at 12:30 there will be a presentation in the Stone Room on Rangers from the period.<\/p> <p>The event runs from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day. Cost is $5. There will be food and drinks available on site.<\/p>",

Please make sure to bring a dish to share (does not have to be a Latin dish, does not have to be home made). But please bring food to share with the rest of the community. They will be selling drinks (water and sodas I presume, no alcohol) but you are more than welcome to bring your own non-alcoholic drinks.<\/p> <p>I will be there at around 1:30pm and will probably stay for a couple of hours. So bring a small cooler with refreshments (and cash just in case they are selling food or drinks) and a blanket.

As I'd hoped, <b>Pittsburgh Filmmakers<\/b> has scheduled <b><i>Testament of Youth <\/i><\/b>for the first week in August.<\/p> <p>Timing isn't ideal, as it's only a week after our visit to Soldiers &amp; Sailors. But <i>c'est la guerre!<\/i><\/p> <p>Also, these schedules are always subject to change. I don't think Filmmakers will pull it, but they could possibly reschedule for later in August if an earlier film is held over.

We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6.

Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6.

By doing this, the people will move our courts back to \u201cCourts of Justice\u201d and take back 100% control of their government.<\/p> <p><b>THE DUTY OF THE <\/b><b>COMMON LAW GRAND JURY<\/b> <b>is to right any wrong.<\/b> If anyone\u2019s unalienable rights have been violated, or removed, without a legal sentence of their peers the grand jury can restore them. And if a dispute shall arise concerning this matter it shall be settled according to the judgment of the grand jurors, the sureties of the peace.<\/p> <p><b>IN A US SUPREME COURT STUNNING 6 TO 3 DECISION JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA<\/b>, writing for the majority, confirmed that the American grand jury is neither part of the judicial, executive nor legislative branches of government, but instead belongs to the people. It is in effect a fourth branch of government \"governed\" and administered to directly by and on behalf of the American people, and its authority emanates from the Bill of Rights and <b>has the power to enforce law and remove people from office<\/b>.<\/p> <p><b>GRAND JURY BACKGROUND<\/b><\/p> <p>When the American colonies separated from England, King\u00a0George retaliated by revoking the charters. Technically, the colonies were without any legal authority to operate. However, civics (the branch of political philosophy concerned with individual rights) was generally taught and known by the people who asserted their rights and maintained order by applying the common law. The people united in the form of common law grand juries and continued the functioning of government.<\/p> <p>As the legislatures matured they slowly increased governmental power while simultaneously reducing personal sovereign power. This was done through a combination of passing pro-government legislation and reducing or eliminating education about civics. Today, two and a quarter centuries later, hardly anyone even knows the meaning of the word, \"civics.\"<\/p> <p>Despite the fact that the state and federal constitutions still acknowledge the common law as the ultimate law system, people everywhere are conditioned to believe that the statutory law and codes are the only source of law. The only remaining common law term generally known among the public is \"common law marriage.\"<\/p> <p>The common law grand jury is now dormant only because of the public ignorance of its powers that supersede all other government entities, including the modern statutorily defined grand jury.<\/p> <p><b>WHAT TO DO NEXT:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Click<\/b> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationallibertyalliance.org\/\"><b>www.NationalLibertyAlliance.org<\/b><\/a><b>, read the\u00a0home page and\u00a0view the video \"The Power of the Grand Jury\" on that page.

We'll meet at Coffee Tree Roasters in Shadyside to chat, drink coffee, and listen to music. Bring your favorite music on your phone or thumb drive to share -- you can even bring an instrument to play if you'd like. And you can just come for the coffee and company \u2013 you absolutely aren't required to bring music (I will bring my laptop to look things up on YouTube as well).<\/p> <p>Bring any music -- if you have music of your own creation, if you're passionate about a particular musician or band, or if you just like something and feel like sharing. It could be a recent find or something that influenced your childhood and got you though your teenage years. It could be something you love or it could even be something you hate -- just tell us why. Music is as much a story as anything -- it could be a story of you, or the story of the artist who created the music, or the story could be embedded in the song itself waiting for us to listen. Feel free to bring a story to share along with the music -- or not, if you prefer.<\/p> <p>We're totally open to any kind of music so, please, bring anything you'd like to share be it classical, ethnic, heavy metal, or whatever -- even classical ethnic heavy metal (I bet it exists). We'll be meeting at Coffee Tree Roasters from 7pm (to probably 9pm though the room's booked until 10pm).<\/p> <p>This event is also posted on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetin.org\">meetin.org<\/a>.<\/p>",

By doing this, the people will move our courts back to \u201cCourts of Justice\u201d and take back 100% control of their government.<\/p> <p><b>THE DUTY OF THE COMMON LAW GRAND JURY is to right any wrong. <\/b>If anyone\u2019s unalienable rights have been violated, or removed, without a legal sentence of their peers the grand jury can restore them. And if a dispute shall arise concerning this matter it shall be settled according to the judgment of the grand jurors, the sureties of the peace.<\/p> <p><b>IN A US SUPREME COURT STUNNING 6 TO 3 DECISION JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA,<\/b> writing for the majority, confirmed that the American grand jury is neither part of the judicial, executive nor legislative branches of government, but instead belongs to the people. It is in effect a fourth branch of government \"governed\" and administered to directly by and on behalf of the American people, and its authority emanates from the Bill of Rights and <b>has the power to enforce law and remove people from office.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>GRAND JURY BACKGROUND<\/b><\/p> <p>When the American colonies separated from England, King George retaliated by revoking the charters. Technically, the colonies were without any legal authority to operate. However, civics (the branch of political philosophy concerned with individual rights) was generally taught and known by the people who asserted their rights and maintained order by applying the common law. The people united in the form of common law grand juries and continued the functioning of government.<\/p> <p>As the legislatures matured they slowly increased governmental power while simultaneously reducing personal sovereign power. This was done through a combination of passing pro-government legislation and reducing or eliminating education about civics. Today, two and a quarter centuries later, hardly anyone even knows the meaning of the word, \"civics.\"<\/p> <p>Despite the fact that the state and federal constitutions still acknowledge the common law as the ultimate law system, people everywhere are conditioned to believe that the statutory law and codes are the only source of law. The only remaining common law term generally known among the public is \"common law marriage.\"<\/p> <p>The common law grand jury is now dormant only because of the public ignorance of its powers that supersede all other government entities, including the modern statutorily defined grand jury.<\/p> <p><b>WHAT TO DO NEXT:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Click <\/b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationallibertyalliance.org\/\"><b>www.NationalLibertyAlliance.org<\/b><\/a><b>, read the home page and view the video \"The Power of the Grand Jury\" on that page.

We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6.

        "description": "<p>The \"Incito Veritas\" founding fathers (which included females, of course,\u00a0as no soul has a gender) originally called this group \"Fight Club\" and first intended to keep that\u00a0name\u00a0while maintaining secrecy. So much for that. But the spirit of Fight Club remains, the idea of trying to bring out the best in each other through the evolution of consciousness. As Brad Pitt said about the movie, \"Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it.\" And not fear the pain! In this meetup\u00a0we discuss ways that concepts introduced during the Incito Veritas series can be applied to our daily lives. We will learn and grow as we process our experiences. Bottom line: Knowing and Not Doing is Not Knowing, or as it says in James 2:26, \"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead.\"<\/p>",

Since receiving it I have heard it mentioned by at least 5 other people, with a few of them being avid players. Since the game is only a 2 vs 2 game and the sets being very expensive ($60 each) I'm going to make this a \"Lawn Game\" Meetup so we can have a bunch of different activities going on at once.<\/p> <p>We can do Kan Jam, cornhole and Spikeball...and if we have enough space we can try Blitzball, which I should be getting in the mail this week. We're going to run this Meetup at the Oval in Schenley Park because we're not going to need a ton of space, but we'll definitely need flat ground for all of our events. Look for us at the top of the stairs near the tennis courts. Each game we have needs 4 players to play them so don't hesitate to bring some friends!<\/p>",

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.<\/p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.<\/p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br\/>\u00a0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Jason,<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>The Aug. 6 Biophilia: Pittsburgh meeting will feature <b>Robert S. Mulvihill<\/b>, the National Aviary\u2019s ornithologist, who will introduce the discussion topic, \"<b>Getting Up Close and Scientific with Pittsburgh's Birds<\/b>.\" Perhaps more than any other natural history subjects, birds help connect people with nature, and ornithology has a long history of contribution by citizen scientists. In 2013, Mulvihill brought the Smithsonian Institution's Neighborhood Nestwatch project to Pittsburgh. He and his crew study the impacts of urbanization on a selection of common songbird species \u2014 northern cardinal, American robin, song sparrow, black-capped or Carolina chickadee, gray catbird, northern mockingbird, Carolina wren, and house wren \u2014 through annual summer visits to nearly 150 backyards in the Greater Pittsburgh area, including the backyard bird habitat of Phipps' executive director, Richard V. Piacentini. Mulvihill will talk about this and the National Aviary's other research and conservation projects.<\/p> <p>Robert S. Mulvihill is a native Pittsburgher who has been an active member of the birding and bird conservation community for more than thirty years. He received a B.S. in Education from the University of Pittsburgh and an M.S. in Biology from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Mulvihill began his ornithological career at Powdermill Nature Reserve, the biological field station of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, where he served as a field ornithologist at the world renowned Powdermill bird banding station. He served as a regional coordinator and species account author for the first Atlas of Breeding Birds in Pennsylvania (1983 \u2013 1989), and recently was the statewide coordinator and co-editor of the Second Atlas of Breeding Birds in Pennsylvania. Learn more about his work at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aviary.org\">aviary.org<\/a>.<\/p> <p><b>Meeting Schedule:<\/b><br\/>5:30 \u2013 6 p.m. Networking and refreshments<br\/>6 \u2013 6:30 p.m. Presentation<br\/>6:30 \u2013 7:30 p.m. Discussion<\/p> <p><b>Directions and Parking: <\/b><br\/>This meeting will take place in the Center for Sustainable Landscapes (CSL) Classroom which is located on the facility\u2019s first floor.

If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.<\/p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6.

There is a small fee per person ($5) to attend Games Day, to cover the cost of the rental hall. This fee is waived for all first-time attendees. The fee will be collected when you arrive, and will grant access to all the games contributed by our members, for use that day. We will be holding off taking any new yearly payments, but those that did pay will be honored.<\/p> <p>Speaking of games, there are always a multitude of board, card, role-playing, and miniature games being played on any given Game Day, but a few events are near constants.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Our Multi-Player Magic League runs each Game Day, starting around 11am. It\u2019s a league that runs Jan-Oct. There is a second league starting at 4:30PM with modified rules and decks, please read the forum post for more information.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Several RPG campaigns are also run each Game Day, including our \"One-Shot Saturdays\", stand-alone adventures run by various GMs each month.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0There are several miniature games that regularly appear at each Game Day. These vary each month, but some examples are X-Wing, Lord of the Rings, Firestorm Armada, Dystopian Wars, Axis and Allies: War at Sea &amp; Angels 20, BattleTech, AT-43, Infinity, and others.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Don\u2019t forget our extensive board game contingent. You can always find players for a board game, whether you bring your own or try out one of the many titles our BGers own and bring each month to our Games Library.<\/p> <p>We ask that everyone attending our Game Days brings something along as a snack and\/or drink, for the community to share in. The facility has a full kitchen, so items that need refrigerated are OK. Most people bring some soda, chips, cookies, veggie tray, etc. This helps everyone have a good time without worrying about snacks or drinks.<\/p> <p>See you at Games Day!<\/p> <p><br\/>Location Information::\u00a0<br\/>Springdale United Presbyterian Church\u00a0<br\/>859 Pittsburgh Street\u00a0<br\/>Springdale, PA 15144<\/p>",

RSVPing to only group is necessary.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.carnegielibrary.org\/locations\/brookline\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.carnegielibrary.org\/locations\/brookline\/<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nThis will be our third meetup at the library in Brookline. I was able to reserve the larger room this time, so there will not need to be a cap. This room fits about 40 people. The library closes at 5:00, so we will need to head out immediately once the meetup is over.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nParking is either diagonal on the side of the street the library is on or parallel on the opposite side. It is never difficult to find a spot to park, but paid parking is enforced on Saturdays, unless you find a side street to park on for free, so be sure to pay at a pay station, because they do ticket on Saturdays.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nTopics you would like to discuss are always welcome and please feel free to contact me with any suggestions. I'm learning this as I go, but hope that our meetings are productive and helpful to those who go. \u00a0As I said at our last meeting, getting that foot out the door can be the hardest part, but is often very rewarding once you do so. \u00a0<\/p>",

Green\u2019s best known novel \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars,\u201d deals with sixteen-year-old cancer survivors confronting their own mortality and attempting to love and support each other with the little time they have left.<\/p> <p>Geeksdanz\u2019s production jumps into the space between Green\u2019s four novels to explore both the similarities between characters and the diversity of relationships, with particular focus on the un-romanticized reality of so-called \u201cromantic\u201d relationships, and the idea that being there to support your partner in everyday problems is sometimes more important than physical attraction.<\/p> <p>More info at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geeksdanz.org\">www.geeksdanz.org<\/a><\/p> <p>$15 Suggested Donation at the door (will be split between Geeksdanz and the Monroeville Library).\u00a0\u00a0I'll be calling a few days ahead to reserve our seats.\u00a0<br\/>If you can't attend on Saturday, there will be an additional performance Sunday, August 9th at 2 pm.<br\/>Geeksdanz Artistic Director Ellen Deutsch is a member of N4B.<\/p>",

If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.<\/p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6.

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.<\/p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.<\/p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br\/>\u00a0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Jason,<\/p>",

For the Pennsylvania Land Snail Atlas Project, Dr. Timothy Pearce collected 17,472 records of Pennsylvania land snails from modern field work and museum specimens, documenting thousands of new county records. Many minute species are now known to be widespread, although they previously seemed to be rare. Dr. Pearce, assistant curator and head of the section of mollusks at Carnegie Museum of Natural History, will discuss his work in, \"<b>Wily Land Snails of Pennsylvania: Where Do They Live and Which Are Rare?<\/b>\" at Caf\u00e9 Scientifique.<\/p> <p><br\/>Dr. Pearce gained an important historical perspective on ecology while working toward a master's degree in snail paleontology at University of California at Berkeley, then he continued studying snail ecology for a PhD at University of Michigan. During a year-long post-doctoral study in Madagascar, he helped find more than 600 undescribed land snail species. During his first curator job at the Delaware Museum, he was awarded that institution's first National Science Foundation grant. His current research at Carnegie Museum of Natural History ecological snail studies in the northeastern and northwestern regions of the United States and in Colombia, South America.<\/p> <p><br\/>Date: Monday, Aug. 10, 2015<\/p> <p>Time: Doors open at 6 pm, and the program is 7-9 pm.<\/p> <p>Location: Carnegie Science Center<\/p> <p>Admission: FREE!<\/p> <p>Parking: $5<\/p> <p>Cash bar: Open from 6-7:30 pm<\/p> <p>RSVP AT\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.carnegiesciencecenter.org\/programs\/adult-programs-cafe-sci\/Caf%C3%A9\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.carnegiesciencecenter.org\/programs\/adult-programs-cafe-sci\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.carnegiesciencecenter.org\/programs\/adult-programs-cafe-sci\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>",

In some applications these changes manifest from changes in laws or government regulations, or maybe just from an aggressive new marketing strategy that requires the application to now support new sales strategies.<\/p> <p>In all instances the software applications we build must support these changes in business rules by setting new validation rules that must be evaluated through all layers. With increasing expectations of instantaneous response times, we should be providing front end validation, but we can\u2019t forget the importance of securing our APIs and of course the database.<\/p> <p>In this discussion we\u2019ll talk about the tools we use to support dynamic business rule validation through AngularJS, C# using Fluent Validators, and SQL server. We are also very interested to know how others have tackled this issue in their applications so that we can all learn some new techniques together.<\/p> <p>About Stefan Vantchev<\/p> <p>Stefan Vantchev has been designing and developing software for over 14 years. His architectural and development background ranges from embedded software to enterprise-level SaaS and desktop applications to data-visualization solutions for a plethora of industries. Stefan has extensive experience with most of the iterations of the .Net framework, with most recent interests including AngularJS, WebAPI, NoSql, Dependency Injection and code modularization. When not serving as software architect at Mosaix Software, Stefan volunteers at the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank and the Waldorf School of Pittsburgh.<\/p> <p>About Girl Develop It<\/p> <p>Girl Develop It is a nonprofit organization that provides affordable programs for adult women interested in learning web and software development in a judgment-free environment.<\/p>",

Lebanon Library the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of each month. This is for players who have had a few lessons or know some basic chords and want to learn more while playing with others. We will experiment with basic strums, alternate chords and how to move from one chord to the next. We will play songs slowly at first and then again, only faster.<\/p> <p><br\/>The group will decide what songs they want to play using \"The Daily Ukulele 365 Songs for Better Living,\" by Liz and Jim Beloff. This book is available from local music stores and on line.<\/p> <p><br\/>Bring your ukulele and a floor music stand along with the music book. If you want to play songs other than what is in this book please notify the group the week prior so copies can be made.<\/p> <p><br\/>As the group progresses, we will introduce the group to more advanced players and more challenging music selections.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you have any questions, please contact Patty Williams at [masked].<\/p>",

You\u2019ll have the opportunity to experience the oils firsthand and to ask questions related to your specific health concerns. There is no obligation to purchase anything after attending this class, but there will be a special promotion associated with attending this class for those who are interested in making their first purchase<\/p>",

So much for that. But the spirit of Fight Club remains, the idea of trying to bring out the best in each other through the evolution of consciousness. As Brad Pitt said about the movie, \"Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it.\" And not fear the pain! In this meetup\u00a0we discuss ways that concepts introduced during the Incito Veritas series can be applied to our daily lives. We will learn and grow as we process our experiences. Bottom line: Knowing and Not Doing is Not Knowing, or as it says in James 2:26, \"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead.\"<\/p>",

If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.<\/p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br\/>\u00a0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Jason,<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>We have had to change our meeting location Riverfront Park in Rochester. \u00a0We will be at the shelter at the end of the street by the parking circle.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Getting around Rochester in general and getting to Riverfront Park in particular can be very confusing.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nDIRECTIONS:\u00a0The simplest approach is beginning from the PA 18 exit (Exit 12) on PA 60, proceed north on PA 18 for 3.1 miles to the Rochester Bridge. Immediately after crossing the bridge, turn right at the traffic light onto Pleasant Street. At the bottom of the hill, in 0.2 miles, you come to a complicated six-way intersection. Turn onto first right \u2014 New York Avenue (which is at a 90-degree angle from the road you are on \u2014 there is a white sign here that says \"Rochester Riverfront Park\" as well as a few other things) and proceed over bridge that bends to the right. After 0.25 mile, turn left at the stop sign onto Harrison Street. The Ohio River and Riverfront Park are ahead at the next stop sign (0.1 mile). Turn right on Water Street; the road runs along the Ohio briefly, then turns north and parallels the Beaver River for about 0.7 mile before terminating in a parking circle.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0We don't plan on anything fancy. \u00a0Vicky Kennedy and I will provide hamburgers and hot dogs with buns. \u00a0Veggie burgers will also be available. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Volunteers to bring other picnic foods would be very appreciated. \u00a0Vicky will be coordinating the food and drink. \u00a0If you would be willing to contribute food or a monetary donation please contact Vicky Kennedy<\/p> <p>[masked] \u00a0or call[masked]<\/p> <p>For this meeting I need to limit it to members. \u00a0If our group continues to grow I'd like to include family members next time.<\/p> <p>As always, suggestions\/comments are welcome.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>This game of Big Ball has been specially requested by some people that have never played it before. \u00a0Join us at the Junction Hollow Soccer Field. \u00a0To get there, type 100 Boundary St, Pittsburgh PA into your GPS and once on Boundary St, go under the railroad track overpass and you'll soon see the parking lot for the field. \u00a0Big Ball is more fun than it looks. \u00a0Check out the details below. \u00a0No spikes or cleats are permitted for this game. \u00a0Come join us for this unique but fun game!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/f\/1\/a\/600_388288442.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This game got quite popular last year and was requested as our Meetup of the week for 7 straight weeks. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>The name of the game is Big Ball. I created this game during my junior year at IUP. The best way to describe the game is that it's a mix between Soccer and Ultimate Frisbee but we use a ball that's about 45\" in diameter. We played it every week for 2 years on the practice soccer field. There is no physical contact with other players permitted but you can use the ball however you want. Any part of your body can touch the ball and there's no height limit on the goals. Also, NO CLEATS OR SPIKES ALLOWED!<\/p> <p><br\/>To see a video of this game in action from 3 years ago, check it out here:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=deBQzfRsBg0\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=deBQzfRsBg0\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=deBQzfRsBg0<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>We will be playing this game at Junction Hollow Field, off of Second Avenue a bit past the Hot Metal Bridge.<\/p> <p>Here are some more details &amp; rules.<\/p> <p>Field size we need is about 60 - 70 yards based on how many players we get (best games are at least 7 vs 7)<\/p> <p>There are 3 lines that matter in the game...the goal line on each side and the line at the center of the field. There are no out of bounds lines on the sides of the field.<\/p> <p>Players can dribble, roll, kick, throw or carry the ball for 3 steps<\/p> <p>The goals are 12 feet wide and there is no height limit on the goal. The game relies heavily on defense. There are also no regulations for goalies or a goalie box. This means your goalie can play mid field if he wants or you can even have 3 goalies...they can even piggyback on each other to be \"taller\" if they want. You just lose those additional players in the field<\/p> <p>Both teams start the game and after each goal at mid-field. The team that wins the coin toss or just got scored on start with the ball. As soon as anything crosses mid-field (the ball OR one of your players that's getting a running start) the other team is allowed to cross the line and start playing defense.<\/p> <p>As mentioned above, there is no physical contact with other players but you can use the ball however you want. If you're in the process of taking your 3 steps you can plow people over with the ball. If someone is charging you, you can kick the ball at them, you can hit people with the ball...I just prefer you don't aim for the head.<\/p> <p>If you do actually blatantly contact someone you get a warning and a 2 minute penalty. Second offense in the same game gets you ejected from the game. This only happened once in 2 years of playing as the ball does a good enough job of not getting players TOO close to each other...<\/p> <p>The ball is built like an exercise ball but it's VERY heavy. I would strongly advise players not try to punch the ball while it's in the air, hit it with one arm or kick it with your feet as it could easily result in an injury or twisting of the body. On that note, it's easiest to \"kick\" the ball with your knees or thigh, hit it with two hands punching close together or hit with the forearms while hands are clenched at the fists.<\/p> <p>We sometimes have players get into a \"scrum\" around the ball and it doesn't move for a while. If that happens and the ball doesn't move for 3 - 5 seconds we'll have a jump ball from where the \"scrum\" took place.<\/p> <p>Games are normally played until 11 and we switch sides of the field when one team scores 6. We usually take a little half-time break at that point too.<\/p> <p>We have had many girls play the sport and they loved it. \u00a0A few of them even had trouble picking the ball up but they still loved the game. Some of them were actually our most die-hard players.<\/p> <p>We normally start every game kicking and throwing the ball in a circle to get everyone warmed up for how big and heavy the ball actually is<\/p> <p>The game is actually the most fun in the rain because of our most important rule...<\/p> <p>NO CLEATS OR SPIKES OF ANY KIND! All players must wear tennis shoes or some other kind of non-grip shoe so they don't have any advantage in the dirt or grass. That's the way we've always played and I feel that makes everyone very even when it comes to maneuverability on the field. You can only imagine what some rain, puddles and slick grass add to a game where no one has traction. Good times.<\/p> <p>Join us on Thursday, August 13th at Junction Hollow Field in Squirrel Hill for a game of Big Ball. \u00a0Just show up to the park to play and bring some friends. \u00a0Don't forget the number one rule...No SPIKES!<\/p>",

The class is donation-based. $5 donation is suggested.<\/p> <p>All classes are from 7:00 \u2013 8:00 pm.<\/p> <p><br\/>Beginners are welcome.<\/p> <p>$5 donation suggested.<\/p> <p>Loaner mats available.<\/p> <p>Visit: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dormontyoga\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dormontyoga\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dormontyoga<\/a><\/a> for more info.

This meetup, done with the flair of quantum physics as a guide, will dive deep into the text and process its soul-inspiring concepts, encouraging all participants to walk their pathway toward Truth. (Note: this is a heavily spiritual group with a strong emphasis on the presence of God in all of our lives ... we will use science as support for the concepts in the course, but the focus is primarily spiritual.)<\/p>",

It explores Garvey\u2019s dramatic successes and failures before his fall into obscurity. Among the film\u2019s most powerful sequences are interviews with people who were part of the Garvey movement decades ago. These interviews communicate the appeal of Garvey\u2019s revolutionary ideas to a generation of African Americans, and reveal how he invested hundreds and thousands of black men and women with a newfound sense of pride.<\/p>",

The only caveat is that everyone who attends must participate, no onlookers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>By the 15th, I hope to have already found a venue for our regular monthly gatherings. We'll pass the talking stick\u00a0to get to know a little about each other and what brings each of us to the circle.\u00a0\u00a0Depending upon our individual experience in circles, we may even speak about how rituals are conducted and what our expectations are\u00a0of our\u00a0circle and of each other. We can grab a bite and have some supper together while we talk. We can also chant a bit and work up some energy. This is an opportunity to join with other women in a spirit of community and spirituality. I'm so looking forward to meeting all of you who come.<\/p>",

If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.<\/p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6.

We will grab some pizza before at Molly's pizza at 6:30 pm. The movie time is at 7:30 pm.<\/p> <p>Here are the movie details: Kevin Bacon (The Following, HBO's Taking Chance, Mystic River) stars in director Jon Watts' delightful throwback thriller Cop Car. When two good-natured but rebellious young boys (James Freedson-Jackson and Hays Wellford) stumble across an abandoned cop car hidden in a secluded glade they decide to take it for a quick joyride. Their bad decision unleashes the ire of the county sheriff (Kevin Bacon) and leads to brutal consequences. (C) Focus World<\/p>",

All levels of play are welcome, and we are novice-friendly. Some people who come have never even held a ukulele, and if you contact Sandy ahead of time, she will bring an extra ukulele for you to try. Try it -- it's fun!<\/p> <p>Music is usually selected from \"The Daily Ukulele... 365 Songs for Better Living,\" by Liz and Jim Beloff. This book is readily available at music stores, book stores, and Amazon.com. Sometimes members bring other music to play (bring 15 copies to share). We play at a large conference table, so bring a table-top music stand if you have one.<\/p> <p>Snacks and libations to share are welcome.<\/p> <p>For more information, contact Sandy at [masked]<\/p> <p>Directions to the Church: Take I279 North to Wexford exit. Turn right at the end of the exit. Right at the light onto Brandt School Road. Right onto West Ingomar Road to 2359. Note - watch for the large sign for the Church and then you will follow a narrow roadway back through the trees to the Church.<\/p> <p>Depending on where you start, there may be a better route to the Church.

        "description": "<p>Joan Didion's incomparable and distinctive essays and journalism are admired for their acute, incisive observations and their spare, elegant style. Now the seven books of nonfiction that appeared between 1968 and 2003 have been brought together into one thrilling collection. Slouching Towards Bethlehem captures the counterculture of the sixties, its mood and lifestyle, as symbolized by California, Joan Baez, Haight-Ashbury. The White Album covers the revolutionary politics and the \"contemporary wasteland\" of the late sixties and early seventies, in pieces on the Manson family, the Black Panthers, and Hollywood. Salvador is a riveting look at the social and political landscape of civil war. Miami exposes the secret role this largely Latin city played in the Cold War, from the Bay of Pigs through Watergate. In After Henry Didion reports on the Reagans, Patty Hearst, and the Central Park jogger case. The eight essays in Political Fictions -on censorship in the media, Gingrich, Clinton, Starr, and \"compassionate conservatism,\" among others-show us how we got to the political scene of today. And in Where I Was From Didion shows that California was never the land of the golden dream.<\/p> <p><br\/>Join us at Silk Elephant in Squirrel Hill for a lively discussion about the changing times of the 20th century from the perspective of one of the greatest contemporary writers.\u00a0<\/p>",

The project has grown and is making an impact through collaboration with community members and groups that support the interests of people with disabilities. This talk discusses the project and the importance of making buildings, parks, maps and apps accessible to everyone. It also describes the efforts made to make online maps and visualizations more<br\/>accessible. Unlock Philly creator James Tyack is a software engineer, civic hacker and accessibility advocate. He\u2019s passionate about building technology that helps create positive, inclusive change in the community.<\/p> <p>Carnegie Library<br\/>www.carnegielibrary.org\/lbph<br\/>Mark Lee and Don Ciccone from the Carnegie Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped will be presenting recent program initiatives undertaken by the library, such as an Advocacy and Advisory Committee to study and recommend programming, the acquisition of tactile maps<br\/>for circulation, game days using tactile games, and training for accessibility features available on iPads. We plan to have an open discussion as to how we can address the needs of the community going forward, as well as an overview of current services offered such as the Braille and Audio Reading Download (BARD) for digital audiobooks.<\/p> <p>Conversant Labs<br\/>Conversant Labs creates voice-enabled applications for the blind and visually impaired. Their first app, Say Shopping is available now in the Apple App store, and allows you to shop from Target.com with your voice.

Movie details: In the summer of 1989, the Mt. Vista motel has been slowly deteriorating on an isolated roadside, and its proprietor, John Henley, is not faring much better. Since his wife left him and their nine year-old son, Ted, John has drifted into despondency, leaving Ted to fend for himself.<\/p> <p>With no parental or adult supervision to guide him, the young Ted\u2019s darker impulses begin to emerge, leading him to explore a growing fascination with death. This fascination blossoms into a bizarre and dangerous method for roping in the occasional passing motorists for an unplanned overnight stop at the motel. When a mysterious drifter is forced to take up residency at the Mt. Vista for several days, he and Ted forge a unique friendship that sends the boy down a dangerous path.<\/p> <p>The Boy comes from the SpectreVision producing team of Daniel Noah, Josh C. Waller and Elijah Wood. It was directed by Craig William MacNeill.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>If you're into music, and even if you're not, here's a great opportunity to share any music you're interested in, have a cup of coffee or tea, and engage in conversation. We'll meet at Coffee Tree Roasters in Shadyside to chat, drink coffee, and listen to music. Bring your favorite music on your phone or thumb drive to share -- you can even bring an instrument to play if you'd like. And you can just come for the coffee and company \u2013 you absolutely aren't required to bring music (I will bring my laptop to look things up on YouTube as well).<\/p> <p>Bring any music -- if you have music of your own creation, if you're passionate about a particular musician or band, or if you just like something and feel like sharing. It could be a recent find or something that influenced your childhood and got you though your teenage years. It could be something you love or it could even be something you hate -- just tell us why. Music is as much a story as anything -- it could be a story of you, or the story of the artist who created the music, or the story could be embedded in the song itself waiting for us to listen. Feel free to bring a story to share along with the music -- or not, if you prefer.<\/p> <p>We're totally open to any kind of music so, please, bring anything you'd like to share be it classical, ethnic, heavy metal, or whatever -- even classical ethnic heavy metal (I bet it exists). We'll be meeting at Coffee Tree Roasters from 7pm (to probably 9pm though the room's booked until 10pm).<\/p> <p>This event is also posted on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetin.org\">meetin.org<\/a>.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Summary:<br\/>Kanban has been used in software development for a number of years. It has a lot of great things to offer. However, when I talk with people about it there are a number of misconceptions. I'd like to dispel some based on what I've learned using kanban for the last 3 years. I'm hoping folks in the audience will share their experiences as well - kanban practitioners are encouraged to attend!<\/p> <p>Michael's Bio:<br\/>I started out in engineering back in the mid \u201890s programming aircraft engine models. I quickly learned I like to build cool stuff, but I also like to be lazy. With software, I can do both! So in \u201899 I made the switch and became a software developer.<\/p> <p>Along the way I realized it isn\u2019t all about heads-down coding - the overall process is important. My agile journey began in the early \u201800s when I picked up some engineering practices from XP. Then I had to lead teams so I learned Scrum. I\u2019ve since introduced Scrum to a number of clients. Scrum worked well, but it didn\u2019t always feel like the right fit. I learned about lean and kanban, and transitioned a team to ScrumBan and eventually full kanban.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve played multiple roles on my journey - developer, tester, project manager, program manager, and architect. And I truly enjoy all of them (well, maybe not testing so much) because they all get me to my desired end state - building cool stuff.<\/p>",

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.<\/p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.<\/p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6.

Good food, good beer, good backgammon - what's not to like?<\/p> <p>We have two large tables reserved for us which will accommodate 6 large boards. If we get more than 12 players we will have to move some games outside. Come at 6:30 for a beverage and one of their awesome wood-fired pizzas. Then we'll start a tournament at 7. They are open until 10 so we should have plenty of time. We'll run a tournament even if only 4 people show up. Which is only 3 other than me, so come on. Round robin or otherwise, we will do this!<\/p> <p><b>Everyone<\/b>: You don't have to enter the tournament at all, you can just come and play backgammon with whoever wants to.<\/p> <p><b>Beginners<\/b>: If we have enough beginners we will try to do a separate event for you, but if not, come anyway and play games with anyone you can find, or go ahead and try your luck in the tournament. I will have a prize for the beginner-level player who makes it the farthest in the tournament.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Tournament Details<\/b><\/p> <p>We will run a \"Single-Elimination Two-Match-Minimum Two Winners\" tournament as\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Backgammon-Meetup\/pages\/Tournament_Formats\/\">explained here<\/a>.\u00a0You are guaranteed two matches. From your second match on, when you lose you're out.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Registration begins at 6:30, tournament begins at 7. They<\/p> <p>close at 10.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The tournament will be capped at 16 players. 5-point matches. The entry fee will be $10, with a $10 optional side pool.\u00a0 The pace will be brisk, but not rushed. If we get 16 entries you will play a maximum of 4 matches in 3 hours. I think that's realistic.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Entry fees will pay 90% return with two winners - 54% goes to the winner of the zero-loss side, 36% to the winner of the one-loss size, 10% goes to the club. (to defray meetup costs) \u00a0<\/p> <p>Side pools will pay 100% return with 60% going to the farthest-advancing on the zero-loss side and 40% to the farthest-advancing on the one-loss side.<\/p> <p>I will have these details printed on paper for you to read on Weds, if you want to.<\/p>",

One effort Sparkle and I are making for our communities this year is something we're calling \"Open Discussion.\" This is a donation based event we're going to bring you once or twice a month. Basically, I will be available in the shop during an hour to an hour and a half one evening a month in order to take questions and have an open discussion on a pre-chosen topic for that time period.<\/p> <p>Sparkle and I have both noticed discussions on when it's better to use herbs or essential oils going on around us, so we decided that should be one of our topics this month. I will bring a bunch of dried herbs, supplements, essences and the like, and she and I will both bring oils to this event. I am a qualified herbalist and holistic practitioner, and Sparkle just so happens to have gone to school at Aroma Apothecary, a school for aromatherapy. So you've got two good and qualified people on your hands, and lots of fun stuff to play with this month.<\/p> <p>Which herbs do what? What's the difference between an infusion and a decoction, and how do I know when to make each? How do I make and use each? How much of an essential oil should I use for which purpose?

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.<\/p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.<\/p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br\/>\u00a0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Jason,<\/p>",

It is on Thursday, August 20th.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/irwinborough.org\/art-and-jazz-night.php\"><a href=\"http:\/\/irwinborough.org\/art-and-jazz-night.php\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/irwinborough.org\/art-and-jazz-night.php<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>The Norwin Art League has graciously and enthusiastically offered their building (right in the middle of all of the action) as our meeting point.<\/p> <p>For anyone who would like to come earlier (bands start at 5:00) and peruse a bit, there are a number of great restaurants in town and a few within a 5min. ride that I could recommend.<\/p> <p>Also, I am proposing grabbing an adult beverage or two after our sketching at 8:30.There is no shortage of watering holes.<\/p> <p><br\/>I tried to look at bus info... but all that I can tell anyone is that PAT and Westmoreland Transit have routes that come through Irwin, but I'm not sure of the times. Irwin, Main St. and Pennsylvania Ave would be the ideal stop. Any bus traveling from Pittsburgh to Latrobe, Mt. Pleasant, and\/or Greensburg should pass by that stop.<\/p> <p>Feel free to make suggestions or ask questions.<\/p>",

We flow from one position to the next and focus on alignment, posture, breath, increased flexibility, strength, and balance. Class is held in the Keith Seminar Center upstairs at Dormont Library. It's private, has dimmer lights, carpet and we play music. I do the practice as I teach it. I tend to break a sweat and others do too, but it depends how much you put into it. The classes are usually 50\/50 men and women. Lots of couples - couples, friends, sisters - attend. The class is donation-based. $5 donation is suggested.<\/p> <p>All classes are from 7:00 \u2013 8:00 pm.<\/p> <p><br\/>Beginners are welcome.<\/p> <p>$5 donation suggested.<\/p> <p>Loaner mats available.<\/p> <p>Visit: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dormontyoga\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dormontyoga\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dormontyoga<\/a><\/a> for more info.

But twenty years later, Heloise considers it a blessing to be a person who knows how to avoid attention. In the comfortable suburb where she lives, she's just a mom, the youngish widow with a forgettable job who somehow never misses a soccer game or a school play. In the state capitol, she's the redheaded lobbyist with a good cause and a mediocre track record.<\/p> <p>But in discreet hotel rooms throughout the area, she's the woman of your dreams\u2014if you can afford her hourly fee.<\/p> <p>For more than a decade, Heloise has believed she is safe. She has created a rigidly compartmentalized life, maintaining no real friendships, trusting few confidantes. Only now her secret life, a life she was forced to build after the legitimate world turned its back on her, is under siege. Her once oblivious accountant is asking loaded questions. Her longtime protector is hinting at new, mysterious dangers. Her employees can't be trusted. One county over, another so-called suburban madam has been found dead in her car, a suicide. Or is it?<\/p> <p>Nothing is as it seems as Heloise faces a midlife crisis with much higher stakes than most will ever know.<\/p> <p>And then she learns that her son's father might be released from prison, which is problematic because he doesn't know he has a son. The killer and former pimp also doesn't realize that he's serving a life sentence because Heloise betrayed him. But he's clearly beginning to suspect that Heloise has been holding something back all these years.<\/p> <p>With no formal education, no real family, and no friends, Heloise has to remake her life\u2014again. Disappearing will be the easy part. She's done it before and she can do it again. A new name and a new place aren't hard to come by if you know the right people. The trick will be living long enough to start a new life.\u00a0<\/p>",

All films are co-presented by Silk Screen. <b><\/p> <p>A live poetry reading by Persian Pittsburgh will be at 7:30. The movie starts at 8:00 pm.<br\/><\/b><br\/>Based on Satrapi\u2019s graphic novel about her life in pre and post-revolutionary Iran and then in Europe. The film traces Satrapi\u2019s growth from child to rebellious, punk-loving teenager in Iran. In the background are the growing tensions of the political climate in Iran in the 70s and 80s, with members of her liberal-leaning family detained and then executed, and the background of the disastrous Iran\/Iraq war.<\/p> <p>The film was co-winner of the Jury Prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. However, it has drawn complaints from the Iranian government and was initially banned in Lebanon after some clerics found it to be \u201coffensive to Iran and Islam.\u201d On 7 October 2011, the film was shown on the Tunisian private television station Nessma. A day later a demonstration formed and marched on the station. Nabil Karoui, the owner of Nessma TV, faced trial in Tunis on charges of \u201cviolating sacred values\u201d and \u201cdisturbing the public order\u201d. He was found guilty and ordered to pay a fine of 2,400 dinars ($1,700; \u00a31,000), a much more lenient punishment than predicted.<\/p> <p>A live poetry reading by Persian Pittsburgh will precede the screening.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Each month I (Rebekah, <a href=\"http:\/\/rebekahgambleholisticpractitioner.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/rebekahgambleholisticpractitioner.com<\/a>) host a meditation event in my office space in Pittsburgh with a new local practitioner as a guest. The format is mostly the same: one of us does a guided meditation, we have a brief break if needed, and then the other does a complementary meditation. The whole event takes about an hour. We have some folding chairs, a couch, and some cushions to sit on, but feel free to bring a mat or something to sit on if you have special needs to ensure they are accommodated. Tea, coffee and water are available at the event in the lobby.<\/p> <p>I am excited to welcome Bob Lardin to be my guest at this month\u2019s event. Robert W Lardin Jr. is a former Catholic Deacon and a retired systems analyst. He is currently active at Allegheny General Hospital in the Holistic Medicine program where he practices Reiki. Bob is a certified hypnotherapist, a Knight\u2019s Templar Reiki Master, and is certified in Quantum touch. He enjoys working with all sorts of conditions and situations in the hospital as well as teaching his methods when the opportunity arises. Bob teaches hypnosis, Reiki and meditation in his spare time, and spends lots of time practicing.<\/p> <p>I will open the event with a meditation on connecting to the sky and earth energies. We will work on feeling the upward and downward flow of energy in the body which is the foundation for energy work, shamanic journeying, and many other practices. You will start to notice different aspects of this energy flow during the meditation, which has the goal of helping your overall awareness of your field and it\u2019s energetic anatomy. After a break following this first meditation, you will draw on these flows and this ground work as Bob assists you with a meditation that has roots in the Templar form of Reiki. This second meditation will use oils. Bob will then demonstrate the different forms of energy he works with in Reiki and Quantum Touch, and show you how to use these different energies in your meditation practice to heal and create change.<\/p> <p>The event is $10 pre-registered or $15 at the door. You may send pre-registration or pre-payments to [masked] through paypal. We are very limited on space for these events and preference is given to those who register ahead of time.<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there!<\/p>",

Usually around 2 hours. We will split the debates up into approximately 4 sections, and it will take 4 meeting to get through each debate.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>This will all lead up to the talk by Ravi Zacharias in October at CMU and Pitt, which we will attend as a club.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>The topic<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we have been talking about free will and the problem of evil during the past few meetings, we will continue the topic by seeing how two famous philosophers William Lane Craig and Sam Harris handle the question of, <b>\"Is God Good?\"<\/b><\/p> <p>Below is a link to the video we will watch. Watch until approximately 30 minutes. This is what we will cover during the meeting.

I\u2019ve also studied Qabalah, the IChing, &amp; Numerology at<\/p> <p>great length and I facilitate an ongoing Tarot class as well as a<\/p> <p>meditation group. After working with the Tarot for over 23<\/p> <p>years and with 13 years of professional experience I\u2019m excited<\/p> <p>to share a brief history of the cards, how to determine your<\/p> <p>soul card, as well as some tips on how to work with the cards<\/p> <p>on a daily basis. During this brief, yet fun and interactive<\/p> <p>presentation it\u2019s my hope that you gather a few new ideas as to<\/p> <p>how to connect with your true inner self and your divinity<\/p> <p>using the cards as your tools. If you have a deck of your own<\/p> <p>you\u2019re more than welcome to bring it along and utilize it, I<\/p> <p>enjoy the hands on experience. I\u2019ll have some decks on hand if<\/p> <p>you would like to use and\/or explore those as well. A notebook<\/p> <p>or journal is always a good idea too! I hope you\u2019ll join me for an<\/p> <p>enjoyable and informative get-together and let\u2019s talk some<\/p> <p>Tarot!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nI\u2019m available for private readings in my home in Edgewood on<\/p> <p>the east end of Pittsburgh, Tarot Parties, and Events &amp;<\/p> <p>Fundraisers. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about the<\/p> <p>cards I have ongoing Tarot Circle at Journey\u2019s of Life in<\/p> <p>Shadyside on the 1st and 3rd Thursday of the month beginning at<\/p> <p>7:30. Also, I post a Card of the Week on Facebook every<\/p> <p>Monday at Intuitive Tarot Readings with Rebecca, go ahead<\/p> <p>and check it out.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nYou can learn more about me at Readingswithrebecca.com and<\/p> <p>you connect with me by email<\/p> <p><a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a> or by phone<\/p> <p>412.310.0400.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nThis program or event is neither sponsored nor endorsed by the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.<\/p>",

If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.<\/p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br\/>\u00a0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Nima<\/p>",

In spare, poetic prose, he portrays a soaring spirit of hope that triumphs over heartbreak, trauma, and insurmountable struggles. A timely must-read.\u201d<br\/>\u2013Library Journal, Starred Review<\/p> <p>\u201cbeautifully written and morally challenging\u201d<br\/>\u2013The Atlantic Monthly, Best Books of 2012<\/p> <p>\u201cA dreamy, postapocalyptic love letter to things of beauty, big and small: a twitching trout, a can of Sprite, empathy, sex, decency, and a good dog\u201d<br\/>\u2013Gillian Flynn, author of Gone Girl<\/p> <p>\u201cBeautifully narrated . . . a book that will surprise you. . . . Hig is a charmer, a man of his word with a wicked sense of humor and an acute sense of survival. His eyes are open to the world as only a poet\u2019s can be, observing and absorbing any beauty left in the aftermath of the world\u2019s tragedy. . . . The author shocks readers with unexpected bursts of action-packed scenes that keep the book moving at a suspenseful pace\u2026a book that rests easily on shelves with Dean Koontz, Jack London or Hemingway.\u201d<br\/>\u2013The Missourian<\/p> <p>\u201cThe prose bears an obvious debt to manly sentence-smiths like McCarthy, Hemingway, and Jack London, but it also has lyrical descriptions of landscape and nature reminiscent of James Dickey\u2019s poetry\u2026it\u2019s always exhilarating (and quite rare) to see a journalist forgo familiar ground for the uncharted territory of fiction, and make such a brilliant success of it.\u201d<br\/>\u2013John Seabrook, The New Yorker<\/p> <p>\u201cHeller\u2019s voice is extraordinary and his narrator\u2019s toughness seems to hide a beautiful and aching restlessness. One of those books that makes you happy for literature.\u201d<br\/>\u2013Junot D\u00edaz, The Wall Street Journal<\/p> <p>\u201cThe Dog Stars is simply superb, an emotive and powerful novel in a refreshingly original style, breath-taking.\u201d<br\/>\u2013SFBOOK.COM<\/p> <p>\u201cDecisively strikes at the ever-arching desire to know what makes us human\u2026. Gruff, tormented and inspirational, Heller has the astonishing ability to make you laugh, cringe and feel ridiculously vulnerable throughout the novel\u2026One of the most powerful reads in years.\u201d<br\/>\u2013Playboy<\/p> <p>\u201c\u2026this novel, perhaps the world\u2019s most poetic survival guide, reads as if Billy Collins had novelized one of George Romero\u2019s zombie flicks. From start to finish, Heller carries the reader aloft on graceful prose, intense action, and deeply felt emotion.\u201d<br\/>\u2014Publishers Weekly, Starred Review<\/p>",

The group could meet at 5 PM and check out the rest of the festival until 7 PM or so.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>But for those that are interested, we'll also have a chance to\u00a0dance off some calories as we continue the 'Dance Lesson, Wine Session' series at the Pittsburgh Dance Center located in the heart of Bloomfield near the Little Italy Days festival.\u00a0 And to make this edition that much more fun and special, we'll also be learning\u00a0some dances to Italian music with songs from Dean Martin,\u00a0Frank Sinatra, Louis Prima\u00a0and\u00a0Andrea Bocelli -- while enjoying Italian wines and pastries!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/8\/2\/0\/600_353890272.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/8\/5\/c\/600_353890332.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The fun ballroom dance lessons\u00a0will be suitable for beginners, with all levels welcome.\u00a0 The doors will open around 6:00 PM so we'll have a bit more time for socializing before the first lesson begins.<\/p> <p>The dance class is only $10 which also includes complimentary pastries and lite snacks -- although some of us may not be\u00a0as hungry after taking in Little Italy Days.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this event is BYOwine -- Italian wines suggested!<\/p> <p><b><i>With so many people in the Meetup, sometimes it can be challenge meeting\/mingling, especially for relatively new members when attending other events at busy art galleries, outdoor festivals, and\u00a0performances at large venues such as the Benedum. So perhaps a series of fun\u00a0activities that bring lots of people together would also help with\u00a0introductions and spotting other\u00a0members at future events.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>In terms of the Meetup for the Little Italy Days portion of the event, there are\u00a0several options although everyone is encouraged to arrive as\u00a0early as possible to enjoy all the festivities, including live music and great street food.<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0 -- Please gather at the Pittsburgh Dance Center (4765 Liberty Ave above Starbucks)\u00a0at 5 PM where you can drop off the wines and\u00a0then the\u00a0group can walk around\u00a0to check out Little Italy Days.<\/p> <p>We hope to\u00a0see everyone\u00a0back at the studio at 6-6:30 PM to enjoy some wine\/pastries and then we will get the party started with a Foxtrot\u00a0class at 7 PM!<\/p> <p>After the first 45-minute\u00a0lesson,\u00a0people will have the option\u00a0to continue dancing until 9:30 PM\u00a0or\u00a0simply enjoy some\u00a0Italian wines,\u00a0snacks, good conversation, and lots of\u00a0laughs. And there will even be a second 45-minute class for those that are interested!!<\/p> <p>This will be a fantastic event bringing people together --\u00a0Meetup groups, PDC clients, and others from the community that may also\u00a0stop by after Little Italy Days.<\/p> <p>In addition to the usual dance lessons people expect (salsa, rhumba, etc.)\u00a0just wait until we learn some dances to Italian music with familiar songs from Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Andrea Boccelli, Louis Prima,\u00a0etc. while enjoying Italian wines!<\/p> <p>While Pittsburgh has a vibrant cultural scene, including classical and contemporary dance, this is our chance to experience\u00a0being a bit more than spectators while learning more about the art of dance.<\/p> <p>Unlike a restaurant where people spend most of the time talking with those seated nearby, the 'Dance Lesson, Wine Lesson' will be less formal so people should be able to meet many others while enjoying the group dance lesson and sharing pizza\/wine.<\/p> <p>While\u00a0there are\u00a0other Meetup groups and organizations in the region that are specifically focused on dance,\u00a0this event is also\u00a0an opportunity for people to see if they might enjoy taking up dance\u00a0in a relaxed, informal atmosphere.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><b><i>Because\u00a0some might be more comfortable bringing a friend for the dance lesson, guests are certainly welcome. So when you RSVP, please indicate if you'll bringing one or more friends.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>This event costs only $10\/person -- please bring cash at the\u00a0door -- and is BYOB wine. The $10 includes complimentary pastries and\u00a0snacks. What a great deal!<\/p> <p>But\u00a0to make the wine appreciation session more interesting, please feel free to bring either your favorite bottle of wine -- or something you've never tried before -- which costs less than $15\/bottle. Italian wine is suggested for this event although there will also be local Pennsylvania wineries participating at Little Italy Days for wine tastings\/purchases and so you could also bring a bottle back to the dance studio.<\/p> <p>For those that live close to the larger state stores, this\u00a0might be a chance to check out one of the Chairmen's Selection wines.<\/p> <p>It would be fantastic if this event included a variety of white and red wines, representing different regions of Italy for the group to try. And if you don't drink, that is\u00a0certainly OK as this event is about having fun, bringing people together, and learning a little more about ballroom\u00a0dance.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b><i>To enhance this event, it would be great if those that were interested in arriving a bit earlier\u00a0on\u00a0Sunday afternoon August 23\u00a0to Little Italy Days could post some comments.

The event is a single night only as an evening soiree \/ performing arts event with small intermissions. It will take place on the 2nd floor in NK\u2019s sanctuary - close to the stars.<br\/>Fans of Cosmos with Neil deGrasse Tyson (American astrophysicist, cosmologist), will make sure to catch this event! It will feature a mix of installation art, performance, music, film, and spoken word that explores the realities and aspirations of life in space, including the materials of the Apollo program, a voyage to the Red Planet, and the question \"How do you make art for aliens?\".<br\/>The artist and initiator of this event Dan Wilcox says: \u201cWe feel there is a greater discussion going on in the national space agencies, private companies (such as SpaceX), and research laboratories that should involve *everyone*. Humanity heading into space in this century will directly impact our society, so we should all be on board.\u201d<br\/>Artists and presenters involved include local artist-musician-engineer performer Dan Wilcox, local new media sculptor Anika Hirt, local astronomer and author Diane Turnshek, documentary filmmaker Jonathan Minard, New York based media artist\/philosopher Sofy Yuditskaya, and Brooklyn based audio engineer and composer Christopher Botta.<br\/>The program with times and further details will be released on www.spaceart.xyz<br\/>Images and further information are available by contacting Anika Hirt [masked]<br\/>Contact: Oreen Cohen<br\/>Neu Kirche Contemporary Art Center,<br\/>1000 Madison Avenue, Pittsburgh PA, 15212<br\/>Phone:[masked], email: [masked]<\/p>",

If you ask a CEO, an open-source developer, and a computer science professor, you'll get very different answers. We'll take a guided tour of the history of ethical thought and apply it to software development in order to understand how others have defined it, and perhaps help to develop your own ethical framework. Along the way, we'll answer questions such as: What would Nietzsche say about malware developers? How are contracting companies like Moses?

Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6.

Menzel\u2019s voice can be heard as Elsa in Disney\u2019s global box office smash<i><b> \"Frozen\"<\/b><\/i>, in which she sings the film\u2019s Oscar-winning song \u201cLet It Go.\u201d After Menzel\u2019s performance of the multi-platinum song at the 86th annual Academy Awards, she made history as the first person with both a Billboard Top 10 hit and a Tony Award for acting. Menzel earned her first Tony nomination as Maureen in the Pulitzer Prize winner <i><b>\"Rent\"<\/b><\/i>, and won the award for her performance as Elphaba in <b><i>\"Wicked<\/i><\/b>\". Other notable roles include Rachel Berry\u2019s mother, Shelby Corcoran, on the hit television show<b> Glee<\/b> as well as starring opposite Susan Sarandon and Amy Adams in Disney\u2019s Enchanted. Menzel starred in her own PBS special, \"Barefoot at the Symphony\", with an accompanying live album of the same name, and her highly successful international concert tour recently included a sold-out performance at Radio City Music Hall. In addition to cast albums, Menzel\u2019s prolific recording career includes the solo albums \"I Stand\", \"Here\" and \"Still I Can\u2019t Be Still\". Her first-ever Christmas album \"Holiday Wishes\", released October 2014 on Warner Bros. Records, debuted at #1 on Billboard\u2019s Holiday Albums chart and is already receiving rave reviews. Menzel can currently be seen on Broadway as Elizabeth in the original production <i><b>\"If\/Then\"<\/b><\/i>, for which she earned critical acclaim and her third Tony nomination, and performed \u201cAlways Starting Over\u201d from the musical at this year\u2019s Tony Awards.\u00a0<\/p> <p>For more information about Idina Menzel, please visit her official website <a href=\"http:\/\/www.idinamenzel.com\">www.idinamenzel.com<\/a> or Wikipedia <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Idina_Menzel\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Idina_Menzel\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Idina_Menzel<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>For more information about this August 25th concert at the Benedum Center, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/trustarts.culturaldistrict.org\/production\/43708\/idina-menzel\"><a href=\"http:\/\/trustarts.culturaldistrict.org\/production\/43708\/idina-menzel\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/trustarts.culturaldistrict.org\/production\/43708\/idina-menzel<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Check out this video from the \"Wicked\" Original Broadway Cast as Idina Menzel &amp; Kristin Chenoweth Sing \"For Good\"<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2fR4JotwwWo\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2fR4JotwwWo<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Check out this video of \"Brave\"<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=luiRqbZ7t8U\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=luiRqbZ7t8U<\/a><\/p> <p>Check out these great articles from the Post Gazette and Trib about the concert <a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/music\/2015\/08\/22\/Concert-preview-Idina-Menzel-brings-big-voice-to-Benedum\/stories\/201508220134\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/music\/2015\/08\/22\/Concert-preview-Idina-Menzel-brings-big-voice-to-Benedum\/stories\/201508220134\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/music\/2015\/08\/22\/Concert-preview-Idina-Menzel-brings-big-voice-to-Benedum\/stories\/201508220134<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/triblive.com\/aande\/music\/8820177-74\/menzel-music-says#axzz3jbub0xge\"><a href=\"http:\/\/triblive.com\/aande\/music\/8820177-74\/menzel-music-says#axzz3jbub0xge\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/triblive.com\/aande\/music\/8820177-74\/menzel-music-says#axzz3jbub0xge<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Meetup Ticket Offer<\/b><\/p> <p>Please note that while this concert is very close to a sell out -- with people paying much higher prices at aftermarket websites (such as stubhub, vividseats, etc. where tickets can range from $80 (last few rows in upper balcony) to $550+ for the best seats) -- the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust has come up with another offer which will include great <b>Director's Circle <\/b>seats to the concert as well as a pre-show gathering with a free drink at the nearby Backstage Bar (655 Penn Avenue) where we'll also have the option of enjoying live jazz outside at Katz Plaza (corner of 7th and Penn) before walking over to the concert one block away at the Benedum.<\/p> <p><br\/>Also if you prefer, the free drink coupon could also be used after the concert or any other time at the Backstage Bar\/Cabaret Theater.\u00a0 We realize that not everyone can arrive downtown early on a Friday night, so this is why we're planning both pre-show and after concert options for the group.<\/p> <p><br\/>Please note that availability is limited.

One Dress.<\/p> <p><b>A tale of faith, redemption, and timeless love.<\/b><\/p> <p>Charlotte owns a chic Birmingham bridal boutique. Dressing brides for their big day is her gift . . . and her passion. But with her own wedding day approaching, why can\u2019t she find the perfect dress\u2026or feel certain she should marry Tim?<\/p> <p>Then Charlotte discovers a vintage dress in a battered trunk at an estate sale. It looks brand-new\u2014shimmering with pearls and satin, hand-stitched and \u00a0timeless in its design. But where did it come from? Who wore it? Who welded the lock shut and tucked the dog tags in that little sachet? Who left it in the basement for a ten-year-old girl? And what about the mysterious man in the purple vest who insists the dress had been \u201credeemed.\u201d<\/p> <p>Charlotte\u2019s search for the gown\u2019s history\u2014and its new bride\u2014begins as a distraction from her sputtering love life. But it takes on a life of its own as she comes to know the women who have worn the dress. Emily from 1912. Mary Grace from 1939. Hillary from 1968. Each with her own story of promise, pain, and destiny. And each with something unique to share. For woven within the threads of the beautiful hundred-year-old gown is the truth about Charlotte\u2019s heritage, the power of courage and faith, and the timeless beauty of finding true love.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe story of four loveable women, miraculously bound by one gown, whose lives span a century . . . will take your breath away.\u201d \u2014Beth Webb Hart, bestselling author of <i>Love, Charleston<\/i><\/p>",

Now \u00a0you can jam with other newer players at Mt. Lebanon Library the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of each month.<\/p> <p>These sessions are for players who have had a few lessons or know some basic chords and want to learn more while playing with others. We will experiment with basic strums, alternate chords and how to move from one chord to the next. We will play songs slowly at first and then again, only faster.<\/p> <p>The group will choose the songs they want to play using \"The Daily Ukulele 365 Songs for Better Living,\" by Liz and Jim Beloff. This book is available from local music stores and online.<\/p> <p>Bring your ukulele and a floor music stand along with the music book. If you want to play songs other than what is in this book, please notify the group the week prior so copies can be made.<\/p> <p>As we progress, we will open the group to more advanced players and more challenging music selections.<\/p> <p>If you have any questions, please contact Patty Williams at [masked].<\/p>",

By doing this, the people will move our courts back to \u201cCourts of Justice\u201d and take back 100% control of their government.<\/p> <p><b>THE DUTY OF THE <\/b><b>COMMON LAW GRAND JURY<\/b> <b>is to right any wrong.<\/b> If anyone\u2019s unalienable rights have been violated, or removed, without a legal sentence of their peers the grand jury can restore them. And if a dispute shall arise concerning this matter it shall be settled according to the judgment of the grand jurors, the sureties of the peace.<\/p> <p><b>IN A US SUPREME COURT STUNNING 6 TO 3 DECISION JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA<\/b>, writing for the majority, confirmed that the American grand jury is neither part of the judicial, executive nor legislative branches of government, but instead belongs to the people. It is in effect a fourth branch of government \"governed\" and administered to directly by and on behalf of the American people, and its authority emanates from the Bill of Rights and <b>has the power to enforce law and remove people from office<\/b>.<\/p> <p><b>GRAND JURY BACKGROUND<\/b><\/p> <p>When the American colonies separated from England, King\u00a0George retaliated by revoking the charters. Technically, the colonies were without any legal authority to operate. However, civics (the branch of political philosophy concerned with individual rights) was generally taught and known by the people who asserted their rights and maintained order by applying the common law. The people united in the form of common law grand juries and continued the functioning of government.<\/p> <p>As the legislatures matured they slowly increased governmental power while simultaneously reducing personal sovereign power. This was done through a combination of passing pro-government legislation and reducing or eliminating education about civics. Today, two and a quarter centuries later, hardly anyone even knows the meaning of the word, \"civics.\"<\/p> <p>Despite the fact that the state and federal constitutions still acknowledge the common law as the ultimate law system, people everywhere are conditioned to believe that the statutory law and codes are the only source of law. The only remaining common law term generally known among the public is \"common law marriage.\"<\/p> <p>The common law grand jury is now dormant only because of the public ignorance of its powers that supersede all other government entities, including the modern statutorily defined grand jury.<\/p> <p><b>WHAT TO DO NEXT:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Click<\/b> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationallibertyalliance.org\/\"><b>www.NationalLibertyAlliance.org<\/b><\/a><b>, read the\u00a0home page and\u00a0view the video \"The Power of the Grand Jury\" on that page.

So much for that. But the spirit of Fight Club remains, the idea of trying to bring out the best in each other through the evolution of consciousness. As Brad Pitt said about the movie, \"Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it.\" And not fear the pain! In this meetup\u00a0we discuss ways that concepts introduced during the Incito Veritas series can be applied to our daily lives. We will learn and grow as we process our experiences. Bottom line: Knowing and Not Doing is Not Knowing, or as it says in James 2:26, \"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead.\"<\/p>",

As always, this is just a social get together to meet other members of the group, introduce yourself and talk about photography. Nothing better than spending time sharing good food and good conversation. Last month we had a great turn out and I'm hoping for the same again this month. This is open to all members, no matter you skill level. Everyone is encouraged to bring prints to show (hence the name). Last month there were some exceptional images. There will also be some discussion on some possible group shoots. Please plan on attending.<\/p>",

Joyce has many varieties of some of these stones in shop for sale if you would like to take them home (and she's incredibly reasonable so I often buy stones here).<\/p> <p>This is going to be as interactive as you want it to be; you will have the ability to work with these stones if you choose to, but nothing will be forced on you in the least.<\/p> <p>If we can answer your questions, we will. If we don't know the answer, I'll point you in the direction you need to go, either towards a practitioner or towards a book.<\/p> <p>This event is being offered without charge in the interest of building a healthy community, but if you'd like to support my work and the shop, donations are happily accepted.<\/p> <p>Look for a new topic and a new conversation in September!<\/p>",

Education-less, motionless, purposeless, and unsure of what the strike will bring, they begin to look for strange ways to kill time. But their idiosyncratic routine is interrupted by the unexpected arrival of Tomas, Sombra's kid brother. Unable to fit in amongst these older slackers, Tomas discovers that unsung Mexican folk-rock hero Epigmenio Cruz has been hospitalized somewhere in the city. Tomas convinces Sombra and Santos they must track him down in order to pay their final respects on his deathbed. But what they thought would be a simple trip to find their childhood idol, soon becomes a voyage of self-discovery across Mexico City's invisible frontiers.<\/p>",

Always RSVP before you come to the event. This helps in organizing and for reserving the courts. Note, without RSVP you may not have a spot.<\/p> <p>2. If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.<\/p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6. If a member is on the waiting list they can still come, however they may have to wait for courts to become available.<br\/>\u00a0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Jason,<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>The women of the Waverley family -- whether they like it or not -- are heirs to an unusual legacy, one that grows in a fenced plot behind their Queen Anne home on Pendland Street in Bascom, North Carolina. There, an apple tree bearing fruit of magical properties looms over a garden filled with herbs and edible flowers that possess the power to affect in curious ways anyone who eats them. For nearly a decade, 34-year-old Claire Waverley, at peace with her family inheritance, has lived in the house alone, embracing the spirit of the grandmother who raised her, ruing her mother's unfortunate destiny and seemingly unconcerned about the fate of her rebellious sister, Sydney, who freed herself long ago from their small town's constraints. Using her grandmother's mystical culinary traditions, Claire has built a successful catering business -- and a carefully controlled, utterly predictable life -- upon the family's peculiar gift for making life-altering delicacies: lilac jelly to engender humility, for instance, or rose geranium wine to call up fond memories. Garden Spells reveals what happens when Sydney returns to Bascom with her young daughter, turning Claire's routine existence upside down. With Sydney's homecoming, the magic that the quiet caterer has measured into recipes to shape the thoughts and moods of others begins to influence Claire's own emotions in terrifying and delightful ways. As the sisters reconnect and learn to support one another, each finds romance where she least expects it, while Sydney's child, Bay, discovers both the safe home she has longed for and her own surprising gifts. With the help of their elderly cousin Evanelle, endowed with her own uncanny skills, the Waverley women redeem the past, embrace the present, and take a joyful leap into the future.<\/p>",

This meetup, done with the flair of quantum physics as a guide, will dive deep into the text and process its soul-inspiring concepts, encouraging all participants to walk their pathway toward Truth. (Note: this is a heavily spiritual group with a strong emphasis on the presence of God in all of our lives ... we will use science as support for the concepts in the course, but the focus is primarily spiritual.)<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Greetings Everyone!<\/p> <p>So as to avoid confusing folks, I am not you usual host, Russ! Nope, it's your friendly neighborhood Redbeard, stepping in to do the hosting in his stead for this one night. He is needed elsewhere. We hope to return your regularly scheduled Russ to you very soon.<\/p> <p>We had a great meetup of 9 or 10 guests the last Friday night that we played , where our feature game was that classic American, theme-heavy style game Cosmic Encounter (FFG) where folks invaded neighboring worlds of the other galactic empires and establish a greater number of colonies on opposing homeworlds than their opponents did. Victory went to Russ in one game, and another table had game that came right down to the wire between Coleman, Matt Wilson, and a newcomer, Jay. Entirely my fault for not knowing who to give the laurels to on that table.<\/p> <p>Folks eventually broke out into a game of Viticulture, which is a European style game with deep strategies. While that was happening, another table tackled games like Roll for the Galaxy, Coup, Colossal Arena, and Neuroshima Hex!<\/p> <p>So , it seems keeping plans light and loose is likely the way to go for this meetup. Feel very welcome to come out and bring games that interest you. Chances are, you will find some folks will be talked into playing it easily enough. Feel very welcome to make your first visit if you have been watching us from afar. The restaurant will be happy to sell you food -- there is no admission. There are plenty of folks who are happy to teach games to newcomers, no experience required. We want to make more gamers! We have games, We know where to find more games. People are tougher to come by, and we hope to be a welcoming and friendly face to any who show up.<\/p> <p>As for an Idea of what games will be handy, I can bring:<\/p> <p>Cabo, Pairs, Pinochle, Machi Koro, Legendary: Marvel Deckbuilding, Shadows over Camelot, Cloud 9, To Court The King, Hanabi, Pandemic with its On The Brink expansion, Condottiere, and Pickomino, to name a few.<\/p> <p>But bring your games! No harm to my ego if we play what you bring instead. I want to see you guys! Drop in. We go until the last person gets sick of hanging around. The end time is not set in stone.<\/p>",

production of the musical <b><i>\"The Light in the Piazza\"<\/i><\/b> which\u00a0features a beautifully crafted score by Adam Guettel (Richard Rodgers\u2019 grandson) and book by Craig Lucas. \u00a0The musical was nominated for eleven Tony awards, winning six, including for Best Orchestration and Best Original Score. \u00a0It ran for 504 performances on Broadway in 2005-2006.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><b><i>\"The Light in the Piazza\"<\/i><\/b> tells the poignant story of Margaret Johnson, a wealthy Southern woman, and her beautiful daughter, Clara, as they tour Italy and the Tuscan countryside during the summer of 1953. \u00a0While sightseeing, Clara loses her hat to a sudden gust of wind. \u00a0As if guided by an unseen hand, her hat lands at the feet of Fabrizio Naccarelli, a handsome young Florentine man, who returns it to Clara. \u00a0This brief episode, charged with coincidence and fate, sparks an immediate and intense romance between Clara and Fabrizio.\u00a0 Margaret, extremely protective of her daughter, attempts to keep Clara and Fabrizio apart as we learn of Clara\u2019s secret. \u00a0Unable to suppress the truth about her daughter, Margaret is forced to reconsider not only Clara's future, but her own deep seated hopes and regrets as well.\u00a0 As Tony Award winner for Best Original Score, Adam Guettel\u2019s score breaks from the 21st century tradition of pop music on Broadway\u00a0with unexpected harmonic shifts and extended melodic structures.<\/p> <p>Check out these great articles and reviews from the Post Gazette and

There is a small fee per person ($5) to attend Games Day, to cover the cost of the rental hall. This fee is waived for all first-time attendees. The fee will be collected when you arrive, and will grant access to all the games contributed by our members, for use that day. We will be holding off taking any new yearly payments, but those that did pay will be honored.<\/p> <p>Speaking of games, there are always a multitude of board, card, role-playing, and miniature games being played on any given Game Day, but a few events are near constants.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Our Multi-Player Magic League runs each Game Day, starting around 11am. It\u2019s a league that runs Jan-Oct. There is a second league starting at 4:30PM with modified rules and decks, please read the forum post for more information.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Several RPG campaigns are also run each Game Day, including our \"One-Shot Saturdays\", stand-alone adventures run by various GMs each month.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0There are several miniature games that regularly appear at each Game Day. These vary each month, but some examples are X-Wing, Lord of the Rings, Firestorm Armada, Dystopian Wars, Axis and Allies: War at Sea &amp; Angels 20, BattleTech, AT-43, Infinity, and others.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Don\u2019t forget our extensive board game contingent. You can always find players for a board game, whether you bring your own or try out one of the many titles our BGers own and bring each month to our Games Library.<\/p> <p>We ask that everyone attending our Game Days brings something along as a snack and\/or drink, for the community to share in. The facility has a full kitchen, so items that need refrigerated are OK. Most people bring some soda, chips, cookies, veggie tray, etc. This helps everyone have a good time without worrying about snacks or drinks.<\/p> <p>See you at Games Day!<\/p> <p><br\/>Location Information::\u00a0<br\/>Springdale United Presbyterian Church\u00a0<br\/>859 Pittsburgh Street\u00a0<br\/>Springdale, PA 15144<\/p>",

Enter to win raffle items from The Children\u2019s Museum, Happy Baby Company, Mother\u2019s Boutique, Crayon Creations by Jess and more!<\/p> <p>Live, Love, Latch! is a National Breastfeeding Month (August 1-31) celebration presented by La Leche League USA and hosted by LLL Groups throughout the country. Live Love Latch! is an event to celebrate breastfeeding and to highlight breastfeeding support. Everyone is invited to attend and sign the declaration of support. You do not need to be breastfeeding to be included. Family, friends, doctors, lactation consultants, midwives, businesses, legislators, and anyone else who supports breastfeeding in our community are welcome.<\/p> <p>The key goal of Live, Love, Latch! is to raise awareness of how a supportive community can help nursing dyads breastfeed successfully. The secondary goal is to break the previous year's record for breastfeeding supporters attending. Last year's national record was 9,028! In the spirit of the Surgeon General's Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding, this celebration provides an opportunity to educate everyone about how they can be supportive to breastfeeding families and how this natural way of parenting effects the community as a whole.<\/p> <p>Any businesses interested in sponsoring the event through a donation are welcome to contact us ([masked])<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Hey everyone I thought it would be fun to do a night on the water. The Gateway Clipper Fleet is a riverboat tour that will give us an hour tour of the city. There is a bar on board for anyone that's wants to indulge. You can buy the tickets on their website or if you go to Groupon.com they have tickets on sale for $12! We will not be making a group reservation because there is open seating so please call and make your reservation for the evening. If you buy the Groupon coupon just let them know and you present it at the ticket office for your actual ticket the day of. Depending on what everyone is up to we can go for dinner or dessert afterwards in Station square. They also have a beautiful fountain we can watch that dances and lights up to music. Hope to see you there! Please be respectful and reverse your RSVP if you can not make it!<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Tsai Ming-liang emerged on the world cinema scene in 1992 with his groundbreaking first feature, Rebels of the Neon God. His debut already includes a handful of elements familiar to fans of subsequent work: a deceptively spare style often branded \u201cminimalist\u201d; actor Lee Kang-sheng as the silent and sullen Hsiao-kang; copious amounts of water, whether pouring from the sky or bubbling up from a clogged drain; and enough urban anomie to ensure that even the subtle humor in evidence is tinged with pathos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The loosely structured plot involves Hsiao-kang, a despondent cram school student, who becomes obsessed with young petty thief Ah-tze, after Ah-tze smashes the rearview mirror of a taxi driven by Hsiao-kang\u2019s father. Hsiao-kang stalks Ah-tze and his buddy Ah-ping as they hang out in the film\u2019s iconic arcade (featuring a telling poster of James Dean on the wall) and other locales around Taipei, and ultimately takes his revenge.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Neon God is a remarkably impressive first film that hints at the promise of its director: a talent confirmed by Tsai\u2019s equally stunning second feature, Vive L\u2019Amour (Golden Lion, Venice), and continuing to his most recent film, Stray Dogs, which ranked high on many \u201cbest of\u201d lists last year. Though showing such diverse influences as the French New Wave, Wong Kar-wai\u2019s early films\u2014and, yes, Rebel Without a Cause\u2014Tsai\u2019s film is most remarkable for introducing his startlingly unique vision to world cinema.<\/p> <p>Tsai Ming-liang| Taiwan | 1992 | 106 min More info and trailer:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/cinema.pfpca.org\/films\/rebels-of-the-neon-god\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/cinema.pfpca.org\/films\/rebels-of-the-neon-god<\/a><\/p> <p>Film screens at 8PM, meet in lobby before<\/p>",
