Typically:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong style=\"font-size : 16px\">1:30 - Washington Screenwriters<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong style=\"font-size : 16px\">2:30 - Filmmakers, Digital Video,<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong style=\"font-size : 16px\">3:00 - DC Casting Actors\/Acting<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : 16px\">We offer networking and a chance to learn what others are doing with their projects and passions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This group allows a variety of technical and non-technical people to get together and learn from each other, discussing ideas and networking. No experience required.<\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span>More about the group<\/span><span>:<\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span>The members of the group come from a variety of backgrounds, ranging from traditional film making to online video podcasting, or animation, or wardrobe, makeup, ... lots of areas. \u00a0In 2014 we also added online course creation \/ eLearning authoring to our mix, as many of the skills apply.<\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span>Future events are often grown from seeds of ideas discussed at events - someone asks a question, and it becomes apparent that many people would attend an event to figure out an answer to the question.<\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Note<\/strong><span><strong>:<\/strong> Activities of this group include technical and non-technical discussion, and networking and some marketing, yet it is not a group for for network marketing (MLM). Marketing can be fine - marketing a business you<\/span> <em>own or are starting as the owner<\/em> <span>can occur during normal flow of event discussions and conversations, via comments about the capabilities offered by the business that are related to this group.<\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span>But activities around presenting a business or product so that you can sign up people under you where you earn a direct cut of their affiliate sign-up fee - not cool for this group (events, email, or online message posts). While some network marketing\/pyramid-structured business opportunities have products that may relate to this space (web\/video\/tech), be respectful of what this group is all about: learning and sharing from each other in an open and un-pressured manner. There are groups for making network marketing pitches - this group is for technical and non-technical exchanges of information, tips, and contacts.<\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n We also have a links section for members works. \u00a0Links to commercial or inappropriate pages &amp; sites will be removed.<\/p>\n<p>Join us if you are interested in or already doing film, video, and related media creation, production, distribution, and editing.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>",

Check in here to meet one another, talk about your favorite wine, restaurants, outings, travels, and\/or just get to know some amazing women. We already know we have one thing in common, we all love wine.<\/p>\n<p>Let's face it, most wine encounters are random. You grab a bottle while shopping for dinner, or you pick something off a restaurant list because your waiter recommends it. Maybe you are visiting friends and they pull something out off the shelf for you to try. Why not schedule some wine tasting (among other things) in?<\/p>\n<p>Whether your wine knowledge includes only two varieties (Red and White); you can name a few varieties that you like; or you have an extensive knowledge of wine (Barbera, Brunello, Cabernet Sauvignon, Dolcetto, Gew\u00fcrztraminer, Grenache, Merlot, etc.), this group is for you. We accept novices to experts. As long as you are looking to be social and share a love of food and wine, we would love to have you.<\/p>\n<p>Join today and check out our amazing group!<\/p>",

Following your own interests.\u00a0 Living peacefully, joyfully &amp; in the present.\u00a0 <strong>Unschooling<\/strong> is freedom, growth, and vast possibilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #0080c0 ; font-size : large\"><strong>Q:<\/strong><\/span><span><small><span style=\"color : #000000\">What is unschooling?<\/span><br>\n\n<\/small><\/span> <strong><span style=\"color : #ff0000 ; font-size : large\"><em>A:<\/em><\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"color : #000000\"><small>Unschooling is a term that the late John Holt coined in the late \u201870's to describe learning that is based on a child's interests and needs. Unschooling does not begin with a parent's notion of what is important to learn and then turn the choices of how to learn the content over to a child. Rather, it begins with the child's natural curiosity and expands from there. Unschooling is not \"instruction free\" learning. If a child wants to learn to read, an unschooling parent may offer instruction by providing help with decoding, reading to the child, and giving the child ample opportunity to encounter words. If the child is uninterested in these supports, the parent backs off until the child asks for help. The most important thing about the unschooling process is that the child is in charge of the learning, not the adult. Unschoolers often do no traditional school work, yet they do learn traditional subject matter. They learn it as a natural extension of exploring their own personal interests.<\/small><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : small\"><strong>Unschooling<\/strong> will look different in different families, and \"<strong>radical unschooling<\/strong>\" simply means extending the philosophy of unschooling (that children will learn what they need to know when they are ready and want to learn it) into every other aspect of life (i.e. children will go to sleep when they are tired, eat when they are hungry, and will learn to be a functioning, helpful member of a family\/household without being forced\/required to do things like chores, given punishments, limited on tv\/videogames, etc.) <strong>Radical unschooling<\/strong> could also be called Mindful Parenting, or respectful parenting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : small\"><strong>Unschooling<\/strong> requires active effort in connecting with your children as they are right now.\u00a0 It requires active effort in finding things in the world that you think would be of interest to them. It requires active effort in giving them as much of the world as you can and letting them choose from it what they love. It requires active effort in basing your life in Joy and Love.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : small\"><strong>Unschooling<\/strong> is a unique opportunity for each family to do whatever makes sense for the growth and development of their children. If we have a reason for using a curriculum and traditional school materials, we are free to use them. They are not a universally necessary or required component of unschooling, either educationally or legally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : small\">If you are new to unschooling, please check out <a href=\"http:\/\/sandradodd.com\/\">Sandra Dodd<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/joyfullyrejoycing.com\/\">Joyce Fetterol<\/a>.<br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : small\">Some quotes to help define <strong>Unschooling:<\/strong><br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : small\">\"Let me sum up what I have been saying about learning. I believe that we learn best when we, not others, are deciding what we are going to try to learn, and when, and how, and for what reasons or purposes; when we, not others, are in the end choosing the people, materials, and experiences from which and with which we will be learning; when we, not others, are judging how easily or quickly or well we are learning, and when we have learned enough; and above all when we feel the wholeness and opennesss of the world around us, and our own freedom and power and competence in it. When then can we do about it? How can we create or help create these conditions for learning?\" - <strong>John Holt<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : small\">\"What we want to see is the child in pursuit of knowledge, not knowledge in pursuit of the child.\" - <strong>George Bernard Shaw<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : small\">\"To parents I say, above all else, don't let your home become some terrible miniature copy of the school. No lesson plans! No quizzes! No tests! No report cards! Even leaving your kids alone would be better; at least they could figure out some things on their own. Live together, as well as you can; enjoy life together, as much as you can.\" - <strong>John Holt.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : small\">\u201cThe woods were my Ritalin.

Our main purpose is to enjoy nature, whether it is hiking, biking, camping, backpacking or bird-watching. We'll also try to do our part to protect the environment by joining clean-ups, trail maintenance, etc., Being with nature is also great for the spirit, but when we are not outdoors we'll do meditation, book-reading, etc., We'll do our own events or join the activities of Sierra Club, hiking and biking clubs, other outdoor and environmental groups and also meditation groups. I have found that enjoying nature brings me in touch with my roots as a human being and helps me to connect better with other living beings and people, without any barriers.<\/p>\n<p>Disclaimer: We provide a way for meeting people with similar interests on a voluntary basis. Participants in our events are responsible for their own safety.<\/p>",

There you'll meet other local fans of personal development thought leaders including coach and author, Anthony Robbins (Tony Robbins). Gather, swap stories, and learn even more motivational techniques while you are building an outstanding peer group. We strive to give PowerTeam members an outstanding return on their investment of time and effort. Every month, we have guests join us to offer information on a variety of topics of interest to high performers -- health and fitness, nutrition, finances, relationships, careers, overall mental well-being, etc. Other activities include goal-setting exercises, coaching support and social and professional networking opportunities. We also engage in annual charitable activities including the Anthony Robbins Foundation's Basket Brigade campaign to feed families in need. Last year, we fed more than 1,000 people in our own communities. Want to help make that even better this year? For more details, check out our website at: http:\/\/www.baltwashpowerteam.org\/<\/p>",

Courts have lights until 11 PM and are free.<\/p>\r\n<p>Please respond to indicate level of interest. Also, if members indicate how far they will travel to play, I can try to find local locations for all to play near your homes. I personally tend to play more in Maryland but also in Alexandria, Crystal City and on the Mall courts. Don't know of many courts in NE DC or PG County. Clue me in, please.<\/p>\r\n<p>I know of sand courts at University of Maryland, Olney Swim Center, Glen Ora Park & College Gardens in Rockville, the courts near Potomac and Kennedy Center.......oh,& the Crystal City courts that are sand on top of concrete. If any members know of additional courts WITH nets up, please email me and let me know. I will add to my database of listings.<\/p>",

Don't worry, whatever you've been doing thus far is not As Good as It Gets.\r\n\r\nAre you saddled with an active brain, a healthy dose of cynicism, a great sense of humor with a sharp wit (maybe even some acerbic sarcasm), bit of shyness, possibly a latent mental disorder or two, some good old fashioned baggage, and perchance stuck between arrogance and lacking self-confidence? Do others see you as aloof but in reality, you know deep down you're awesome but you just can't bear the thought of trying to convince others when they should really just 'get' you?\r\n\r\nAre you into music, wine, beer, great food, and conversation (when it's needed - otherwise silent pauses are allowed), but tired of doing it all alone or being let down by others (in a myriad of ways)?\r\n\r\nShall we rant and rave? Eat and drink till dawn? \r\n\r\nLet's rock.",

We know, we are all single parents too!<br>\n\n<br>\n\nThis group's mission is to create a platform to help empower each other as&nbsp;single parents. As parents, we need to ensure that both&nbsp;we and our children are happy, thriving, and are emotionally healthy, despite the challenges that we face. We like you to feel that you and your child\/children always have a friend to talk to, places to go, things to do, things to learn, talents to offer, or possibly help when you need it.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nThe way we approach this is by several activities that include 1) hosting various events at members homes or in public places, 2) visiting musea, theatres, and 3) suggesting events, organized by other entities, that members can attend. We include parent-and-child and parent-only events.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nIn return, we ask that our members be involved by suggesting, hosting and attending activities; supporting fundraisers; and by participating in discussions. If the activites that are posted are not appropriate for your childs age and\/or interests, you are invited to post and\/or host alternative ones.<\/p>\n<p>All members must have a complete profile: photo, brief introduction, and answer the introductory questions.<\/p>",

Though there are occasions in the clubs when they are taught on an infrequent level, we feel that there is a real desire for more ongoing and intense training in each one of them, and why we are starting this new Dance Class and Training Meetup to coincide with our weekly Sunday Salsa, Rueda, Latin &amp; Tango Social. Whenever each of these dance styles are played in the social events, NO ONE SITS! Which means that everyone loves the music and dance styles, though many struggle with effectively dancing them. The classes will take place every Sunday at 2pm in Cha Cha and 4pm in Bachata and Merengue at the same time as Beginner &amp; intermediate Salsa taught by Mein and Terry Chasteen at the Chevy Chase Ballroom. Both classes are then Followed by beg &amp; int Salsa Rueda at 5, Argentine Tango at 6 &amp; dancing in the Latin dances and Argentine Tango in 2 studios at once from 7pm -11pm every Sunday.<\/p>",

Lambda DanceSPORT DC (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.LambdaDanceSportDC.org\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.LambdaDanceSportDC.org\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.LambdaDanceSportDC.org<\/a>) is an affilliate of the LGBT DC Sports Connection, Team DC (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.TeamDC.org\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.TeamDC.org\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.TeamDC.org<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n DanceSport in C\/W, Ballroom &amp; Latin is\u00a0one of\u00a0the 25+ sports\u00a0offered in competition\u00a0during\u00a0Gay Games. If you might\u00a0be interested in participating in Gay Games or be added to the Federation of Gay Games email list, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/gaygames.org\/phplist\/?p=subscribe&amp;id=1\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/gaygames.org\/phplist\/?p=subscribe&amp;id=1\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/gaygames.org\/phplist\/?p=subscribe&amp;id=1<\/a> to sign up for their monthly newsletter.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n You'll\u00a0meet and dance with other members and supporters of the local Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and LGBT-friendly dance Community, whether strictly for social dancing or competition during the upcoming Gay Games (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.gaygames.com\/\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gaygames.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.gaygames.com\/)<\/a> 2014.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n Much of the focus of Lambda DanceSPORT DC (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.LambdaDanceSportDC.org\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.LambdaDanceSportDC.org\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.LambdaDanceSportDC.org<\/a>) is to promote dance events that are available to everyone in our LGBT community as well as a high priority toward training since so few in this community are already familiar with the social Ballroom, Latin, Swing and more couples' dances or higher level competitive C\/W dances. The time is long overdue for us in the USA to develop our talents as same-gender couples \"Out On The Dance Floor\" (Visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pleasedancewithme.com\/gmyopinion.htm#grassrootsgayactivism\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pleasedancewithme.com\/gmyopinion.htm#grassroot\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.pleasedancewithme.com\/gmyopinion.htm#grassroot<\/a>...) as is extensively done in the LGBT community of Europe.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n Same-gender DanceSport is an activity that could well become one of the most effective forms of grass roots\u00a0lgbt activism available to us today. Grass roots\u00a0lgbt activism which is essential when it comes to influencing those that enter the voting booths to ultimately decide for or against our fair and equal treatment.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As we get comfortable with our dancing skills, we'll find ourselves easily taking them out into society without reservations of dancing socially as same-gender couples in public which will eventually change the strictly \"sex, drugs and alcohol\" images that the the right wing loves to portray about this community; and which they can get away with because by hiding away in our LGBT-only venues, we never prove otherwise in our social lives.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n The only way for us to change this image is to feel comfortable socializing as male and female couples right along with the rest of society and without hesitation. And what better way is there to socialize with them than by joining them... \"Out On The Dance Floor\"?<\/p>\n<p>I can guarantee that without even asking for attention, when we're good at what we do in our dancing as male and female couples, there won't be a single pair of eyes in the room that won't give us more attention than we'd ever imagined. And it will eventually change their perceptions of us more than we would ever believe.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n Some of us have already proven this fact by dancing together as couples in huge non-LGBT venues where same-gender couples JUST DON'T GO. And in the process we have made more friends for our community than any one of us ever thought possible in a single night; just by putting our reservations aside and by being good at what we do. How can hard-core bigots who love to criticize us do so when we're out-dancing them in droves? And when we can both lead and follow at ease, they go NUTS! making it even more impossible for people to get away with being in the slightest way condescending, even among their own peers. I know that. I've heard them try and I've heard them rebuked for not being able to match our abilities and our role-changing talents.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n Start preparing today in Ballroom, Latin, C\/W, Swing and more for social dancing, Gay Games, World Outgames and IAGLCWDC Country\/Western events in addition to any upcoming US Same-gender DanceSport events, the GMCW Spring Fling, the PFLAG Gala and the Mautner Project Gala. Not to mention the numerous non-LGBT dance events such as weddings and black-tie affairs that we attend and stand around watching instead of really expressing our Ballroom, Latin, C\/W, Argentine Tango, Hustle &amp; more talents in public. In no time at all we soon become true grass roots gay activists; not in the courts or at the ends of picket signs, but rather \"Out On The Dance Floor\"!(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pleasedancewithme.com\/gmyopinion.htm#grassrootsgayactivism\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pleasedancewithme.com\/gmyopinion.htm#grassroot\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.pleasedancewithme.com\/gmyopinion.htm#grassroot<\/a>...)<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n Training for same-gender couples is available every Wednesday evening and all day Sunday from 3pm-11pm during DanceSport at Dupont Circle (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dancesportdupont.com\/\">http:\/\/www.DanceSportDupont.com<\/a>)\u00a0plus at other venues when provided by their organizers.

        "description": "<p>The Bowie Meditation group meets twice a month at the Goodloe Memorial Unitarian Universalist Church in Pointer Ridge on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday evenings of each month, 7:15 &ndash; 8:30pm. The group welcomes all. No prior experience in meditation is needed. We just bring your hearts and hopes, and sit with them together, allowing the \"mud\" in our lives to settle and our minds to clear.<\/p>\n<p>In meditation, we focus on quieting the mind, encouraging the heart, and in finding the simple, natural connections to all life around us. Although, everyone&rsquo;s experience is different, many have felt the calm and clarity to be beneficial.<\/p>\n<p>Our meditation periods include both spoken guidance and the unspoken support of others following the same practice. Usually, the group begins with a short period of introduction, transitions to a 20 minute seated meditation, and then shares a few minutes of walking meditation before a teaching around the subject of meditation is presented. Meditators sit on cushions or chairs, and walking is optional.<\/p>\n<p>We are a \"peer led\" group, sharing teachings in the Insight Meditation and Mindfulness traditions. At this time our group leaders (Lee, Alex, and Azara) generally alternate in leading the evening meditation and teaching. All three are experienced meditators who have practiced and studied meditation under various teachers. Please feel most welcome to take part.<\/p>\n<p>On the fourth Thursday of the month, we usually have optional tea and conversation after meditation. You may bring you own mats and pillows, use the mats and pillows at the church, or use a church chair. Weather Policy: If Prince George's County Public Schools do not open, or if they close early, due to weather, we will not have a meet-up on that evening.<\/p>",

Hemos tenido la suerte de encontrarnos y para mi tenerlas en mi vida es una de las cosas que me da energ\u00eda todos los dias.<\/p>\n<p>En alg\u00fan momento pens\u00e9 que la prioridad de este grupo seria para los chicos, que les ayude a ser sociables y tener amigos, que convivan con otros ni\u00f1os de similares experiencias y que escuchen y practiquen su espa\u00f1ol lo mas seguido posible. Claro todo eso sigue siendo importante, pero al final del dia me doy cuenta que este grupo es para nosotras, a celebrar nuestra amistad, celebrarnos los peque\u00f1os logros de cada dia y es verdad que mientras una se sienta bien los chicos y nuestras familias se benefician.<\/p>\n<p>Gracias amigas por su amistad, a las que quieran unirse a conversar en espa\u00f1ol estan bienvenidas, tando como las que gusten salir, tomarse un cafe, a contarnos de sus hijos o familias, a las que les gusta ir de restaurante en restaurante, hablar de la comida, de nuestros pa\u00edses, de cualquier tema las espero, haber que pasa =)<\/p>\n<p>Please do not use this group to promote your business, be it home based or otherwise. If a you list a home party or plug your business on our message board, it will be deleted. I do apologize, and I REALLY hate talking about this stuff because it can stir up a lot of negative feelings for some people -- I hope you understand. We have had some pretty bad experiences with this sort of thing. Again, thanks for being so cool and understanding.<\/p>\n<p>22 de Enero, 2014<\/p>",

Cohousing Collaborative, LLC, is delighted to announce we are expanding this Meet Up site to include the many and varied activities surrounding building sustainable communities -- most particularly cohousing communities. This site will be focused on creating Meet UPs for folks to meet and discuss topics of social sustainability in our changing world. How can we help each other through these tough economic times? How can we encourage each other to live more simply? To reduce our individual carbon footprint as well as the carbon footprint of our larger communities? What would it mean to build a sustainable community in the metro DC area? Farther beyond? What resources do we need? How will we take care of our children and our elders in a time of economic stress? We will also present topics on the \"hardware\" of sustainability such as Low Impact Development, green architecture and design, rain gardens, green roofs, and much more! Some of these Meet UPs will be organized by Cohousing Collaborative. AND we are inviting YOU to organize a topic you are interested in. If you want to organize a discussion through this Meet Up one of our Meet Up organizers will assist you. We want this site to be a two-way (actually -- a multi-way) conversation for advancing community in our area. We invite you to post notices of meetings, events, information, opportunities to live in built or building communities, etc. relating to cohousing and sustainability to this Meet Up group. We want this site to be a nexus for information and education about community and sustainability. NOTE: many communities post to this Meet Up site. Cohousing Collaborative is not associated with these organizations or individuals except through our mutual interest in cohousing. CC is not responsible for their postings. We discourage outright marketing for personal gain to the Meet Up. Rentals, sales, notices of meetings, forming groups, etc. all OK! In the next few weeks, we will be inviting more people to join the Meet Up. We look forward to more activity on the site and in person! We respectfully request that members of the Meet Up post only information pertaining to sustainability, community living, cohousing and related topics. IMPORTANT NOTE: You can control your email. You may elect to receive email from this Meet Up in three ways: 1) from the organizer only, 2) in a daily digest or 3) as emails are posted. We invite your participation in this expanded agenda! For further information or clarification: Call or email Ann Zabaldo 703 663 3911; ann@cohousingcollaborative.com Welcome!<\/p>",

You'll learn ways to develop your intuitive abilities, connect with your guardian angels, heal, and most importantly, learn and grow spiritually. Instead of going to psychic to get insights for you, become empowered to develop your own intuition and get your own insights and answers for your direction and success.<\/p>\n<p>You have a unique life purpose and a spiritual path. Discover what your life purpose is, and live it for happiness, success and abundance!<\/p>\n<p>We have a community of people in the DC metro area who meet regularly for groups, healing sessions, workshops and lectures through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Inner-Peace-Movement-Programs\/115559181878504?sk=wall\">Inner Peace Movement programs.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>You're not alone in thinking this way! Connect with like-minded, friendly people who sincerely want to learn and grow together. We can all learn something from each other.<\/p>\n<p>The philosophy of the founder of IPM Dr. Francisco Coll was \"If you give a hungry man a fish today he will only be hungry again tomorrow. If you teach him how to fish, he will be able to feed himself for the rest of his days\". Learn how to fish by discovering simple means to raise your energy, be tuned in and connected with Spirit and trust your own intuition. It won't steer you wrong!<\/p>",

We will have couples and singles enjoying cloths free activities regardless of physical size, shape, or body condition. Conversation seems to come easier without the social class distinctions often indicated by clothing. Relaxation, stress relief, positive body image, and increasing self-esteem are just a few of the reasons people choose the nudist lifestyle.

Yule (from the Norse iul, meaning wheel) marks the death and the rebirth of the Sun God; it also marks the vanquishing of the Holly King, the god of the Waning Year, by the Oak King, the God of the Waxing Year. The Goddess, who was Death-in-Life at Midsummer, now shows her Life-in-Death aspect; for although at this season she is the leprous white lady, Queen of the cold darkness, yet this is her moment for giving birth to the Child of Promise, the Son-Lover who will re-fertilize her and bring back light and warmth to her Kingdom. (_Eight Sabbats for Witches_ by the Farrars)<\/p>\n<p>Modern Christmas celebrations are full of pagan symbology. Santa Claus is the Holly King, the sleigh is the solar chariot, the eight reindeer are the eight Sabbats, their horns represent the Horned God, the North Pole symbolizes the Land of Shadows and the dying solar year, and the gifts are meant both to welcome the Oak King as the sun reborn and as a reminder of the gift of the Holly King, who must depart for the Oak King to rule.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Blessed be!&nbsp; See you at our Yule Celebration!<\/p>\n<p>Lord Skye<\/p>",

The club's intention is to get people involved in sailing either to help boat owners find crew or as groups sharing the cost for chartered boats or for group sailing events. If you are a private owner, you are invited to contact us so that you can post \"calls for crew\" on our calendar. Finding a crew, looking to crew, sharing costs for a charter, or organizing your race crew events the Baltimore-Annapolis Sailing Club provides an easy way for both captains and crews to communicate.<\/p>\n<p>You don't have to know how to sail to be part of the group, only a willingness to learn. People with boats usually always welcome guests aboard to help pull ropes, turn cranks, or pass out drinks. That is what \"crewing\" is all about. Sailing is fun, so let\u2019s go have some fun.<\/p>",

The ways of the Jedi are ancient and fundamental. Its wisdom has always been there for those who sought it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #003366\"><br \/>The Maryland\/Virginia Jedi Chapter is not a role-playing group, nor is it a Star Wars fan group, although many of us are fans. This group is designed to bring together people who follow and practice the principles of the Jedi path in real life. Come explore the real life foundations on which the fictional Jedi were based such as Eastern philosophy, self-awareness, meditation, self-defense, martial arts, psychic development, energy cultivation, healing, volunteerism, and much, much more.<br \/><br \/>If you&rsquo;ve ever been inspired by the Jedi in the movies, this is your chance to follow that path in the real world. At the Maryland\/Virginia Jedi Chapter you can meet with others who know that life and meaning are more than meet the eye. Learn practical concepts and techniques to better yourself and those around you and bring your own wisdom to share with the group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #003366\">We have local Chapters throughout Maryland including Catonsville, White Marsh, Hanover, and Rockville Maryland, and now Northern Virginia. You can also check out the Jedi Resource Center \/ Jedi Gatherings Group (www.jediresourcecenter.org) if you wish to meet other Jedi on a more global scale.<br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #003366\">Please come join us on this journey.

        "description": "<p>This is the Tantra &amp; Tantric Yoga Students Group, formerly T Anonymous group. That group no longer exists. My only reason for taking this on is to promote the growth in knowledge of these ancient Indian practices. I am not looking to sell you anything, make you come to any high priced workshops or browbeat you for NOT attending. I seek multiple sources of information for the betterment of the group. Many books exist for our group edification. We might benefit by reading them, en masse, outside of our meetings or class, if you will, and then sharing our views, in a weekly, biweekly or monthly meeting. The periodicity of how often is to be driven by us all. I do not see an authoritarian model as the way to go. There are Videos out there as well. We may be able to share those. I know some locations that have massage therapy, Qi Gong courses, OSTENSIBLY qualified international authorities on related subjects. I am asking each member who is associated with the practices of Tantra and associated physical\/spiritual practices to step up and contact me. We can use the skills we have already within our membership to, at least, get on the path of combined spiritual growth and sexual growth and self mastery. I suppose we all came to this group from different directions. As a man, I found the idea of combining one's spiritual growth and closeness to a Godhead with an ability to be intimate and merge with a partner for several hours at a time to achieve an intense oneness to be most intriguing and worth exploration. I do not know what a woman's motivation is. I only know my own. But, as a human being, I would like to be able to see that side of the equation, the other half of the human race's point of view regarding Tantra. Combining two transcendent experiences, achieving spiritual growth and connection with intense sexual connections, strikes me as a good idea. I would invite those of you who find this equally of interest to let me know your thoughts. I am going to be shouldering the monthly costs of this group myself at first but would like to be able to set up a PayPal or Google Payments structure such that each of us willingly contributes a dollar monthly to keep this group going. By so doing, we MAY be able to bring speakers to meetings or go to a massage therapy practitioner for some hands-on body work. I cannot force any of you to kick in but a dollar is a dollar. In aggregate from us all, it makes the load lighter. I certainly will appreciate you so doing. Once again, those of you who are already yoginis or have ongoing Tantric training, PLEASE share that with me. We can work together and make this a better group, a less expensive group to run and hopefully have MORE fun. Tantra should be fun, joyous and wondrous if you think about it. Where else can you combine one's sexuality with one's quest for spiritual growth and enlightenment? I will be researching texts that we all can read, on our own, sort of like a book club format initially, and then we can meet to discuss the subjects addressed. Afterwards, we can go out for lunch or happy hour or dinner or whatever is appropriate, given the times that get set up. At this juncture, I am leaning towards Wednesday evenings or perhaps alternate Saturday afternoons. I am open regarding this. Please give me some feedback on what you all can attend regularly. I am the Organizer of the MD\/NW DC VB Meetup as well and we have weekly meetups on Mondays, Tuesdays, some Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Fridays, I am involved in leagues. Alternate weekends, I have my son. Wednesdays work for me and so do alternate Saturday afternoons. Regarding times for both, Wednesdays at 7 or 7:30 PM and Saturday afternoons at anytime starting from 2-3:30 PM and running until about 6:00 pm is fine with me. ALL of this is flexible. We will have to come to a group awareness of what works. While I currently reside in close in Md., I likely will move in coming months so location may be fluid as well. ALexandria, like where I currently reside, is quite far south. I would suggest some location in Arlington, NW DC or close in Maryland near to Chevy Chase. THe idea with those being to address Metro accessibility. Some feedback about locations in those areas would be appreciated. 91 brains are better than ONE. So, we have a day of the week, more or less, a time of day, a zone of locations, all good. For now, there is not yet a scheduled Meetup. I will do so by the end of next week or earlier. Please bear (not bare) with me, if you will. I will find us a location, based on number of those likely to attend, and schedule a day and date to meet. PLEASE let me know how often you all would like to meet to move forward on our group spiritual path. I welcome your feedback, serious or silly. Remember that part of spiritual growth is FUN! I look forward to meeting you all. Namaste, my fellow Tantrikas.....<\/p>",

Well come connect with others who are interested in Socrates Cafe, a philosophical community. Be a social thinker!<\/p>\n<p>Our basic guidelines, established centuries ago in Plato's Dialogues,\u00a0are that all opinions expressed need to be supported by <strong>reasons<\/strong>,\u00a0and that all assumptions need to be examined. Dialogue is not a competition, a\u00a0sport or debate with winners and loses. Nor are members allowed to dominate\u00a0the dialogue at\u00a0the Socrates Cafe solely for the purpose of expressing\u00a0off-topic\u00a0personal political, religious, or ideological opinions.<\/p>\n<p>Certainly personal opinions enter the dialogue, but the Socrates Cafe is not a ideological\u00a0megaphone for one member. Rather we challenge the\u00a0\"conventional\u00a0wisdom\" in the spirit of open-minded inquiry and friendly objectivity. We are a laboratory where member opinions are tested by the Socratic Method, not a\u00a0group with an agenda where everyone seeks confirmation of their preconceived opinions.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n This Takoma Park\/Silver Spring-based meetup was inspired by the 2001 book <em>Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy<\/em> by Christopher Phillips. Our model is described in Wikipedia:<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Socrates Caf\u00e9s<\/strong> are gatherings around the world where people from different backgrounds get together and exchange thoughtful ideas and experiences while embracing the <span style=\"color : #0645ad\"><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socratic_method\">Socratic Method<\/a><\/span><\/span>. The groups model their discussions from the book of the same name Christopher Phillips; there are over 400 ongoing gatherings around the globe coordinated by hundreds of volunteers.\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socrates_Cafe\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socrates_Cafe\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socrates_Cafe\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socrates_Cafe\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socrates_Cafe\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socrates_Cafe\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socrates_Cafe\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socrates_Cafe\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socrates_Cafe\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socrates_Cafe\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socrates_Cafe\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socrates_Cafe\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socrates_Cafe<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosopher.org\/en\/Socratic_Method.html\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosopher.org\/en\/Socratic_Method.html\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosopher.org\/en\/Socratic_Method.html\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosopher.org\/en\/Socratic_Method.html\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosopher.org\/en\/Socratic_Method.html\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosopher.org\/en\/Socratic_Method.html\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosopher.org\/en\/Socratic_Method.html\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosopher.org\/en\/Socratic_Method.html\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosopher.org\/en\/Socratic_Method.html\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosopher.org\/en\/Socratic_Method.html\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosopher.org\/en\/Socratic_Method.html\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosopher.org\/en\/Socratic_Method.html\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosopher.org\/en\/Socratic_Method.html\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosopher.org\/en\/Socratic_Method.html\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.philosopher.org\/en\/Socratic_Method.html<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socrates_Cafe\"><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/span><\/a> We delight in our ability to wonder about-and inquire into-deeper meanings. After all as children we always asked \"why.\" It only comes naturally. Indeed if it had not been for the \"why question\" we would still be in the cave. And if people want to talk about deeper questions of meaning and reality solely from the vantage point of the animal kingdom they have missed the point of the Socrates Cafe entirely. We are adult humans engaged in rational (human) dialogue. And FYI the organizer is an animal lover who has great sympathy for the animal kingdom:)<\/p>\n<p>And while philosophy draws on facts and findings compiled by the\u00a0\"humanistic\" sciences\u00a0 (sociology, psychology etc.), philosophy is a broader inquiry not restricted by specialist assumptions (including the natural sciences).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Hope to see you soon!<\/p>\n<p>Feel free to email me with any questions or comments.<\/p>\n<p>John W<\/p>\n<p><span>jwalrajl@gmail.com<\/span><\/p>",

The 9-12 Project is designed to bring us all back to the place we were on September 12, 2001. The day after America was attacked we were not obsessed with Red States, Blue States or political parties. We were united as Americans, standing together to protect the greatest nation ever created.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>This is a non-political movement but we will explore the political parties, platforms, rhetoric and deciding what helps or hurts the country. With that, we hope that you will view candidates based upon their principles rather than their party. Parties have done nothing but separate our great nation. Divided we fall but united we will stand! Let us find our common ground and stand united once more! The foundation and common ground of this group should be based upon our United States Constitution, Bill of Rights and the Federalist papers . These are the foundation that our country was built on.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>We believe that our members should be as self sufficient as possible and to that end we will teach each other about emergency preparedness. &nbsp;We will also on occasions teach others some of the skills that we have learned.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>We encourage and allow open, positively presented discussion about The 912 Project. There are NINE PRINCIPLES and 12 VALUES.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>Here is the 912 Project \"Headquarters\".... <a href=\"http:\/\/www.the912project.com\/\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.the912project.com\/\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.the912project.com\/\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.the912project.com\/\">http:\/\/www.the912project.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>Notes: <br> **I am not a professional moderator or organizer. <br> **I do believe we collectively need to help change the direction the country is heading and I personally want to be involved. <br> **If you are interested in this group and would like additional information I will try to answer your questions.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>Some IMPORTANT NOTES:<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>NOTES ON JOINING: Refer to THE 912 PROJECT for the details of what this is all about if you have doubts. If your goal is to contribute and engage constructively, debate intelligently, and be active, we welcome you. If it is your goal to serve a particular party or be disruptive or divisive in ANY WAY, please look elsewhere. If you join and do that or do not honor the intent of the project, you will be disenrolled.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>NOTES ON MESSAGE BOARD POSTS: The moderator will not tolerate name calling, verbally abusive language, and attempts to degrade legitimate discussions on the message boards. Behavior of that kind means the writer can no longer engage in intelligent, civil debate. Please refrain from and report such abuses. Offenders will be given one warning and a second chance. Repeat offenders will be dropped from the group.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>NOTES ON SOLICITATIONS: NO SOLICITING MEMBERS! If you should choose to make that mistake, I cannot be responsible for the actions of several of our VERY tech savvy members. I understand that SPAM en masse can be horrible.<\/p>",

Do you actually CHOOSE to pick up novels by the likes of E.M. Forster, D.H. Lawrence, Emily Bronte, or maybe Toni Morrison?  Does exploring philosophical classics (Plato's Symposium, maybe? Sartre? Hume?) actually appeal to you? \r\n\r\nIf reading great literature with a friendly, laid-back, edgy intellectual crowd turns you on, then this is the meetup for you.  We won't take ourselves or anything TOO seriously, but we will delve into some fantastic books, talk about them, discuss, debate, learn, etc.  And we will have fun. \r\n\r\nIt's OKAY to be into this kind of thing.

So dive in, sample a few and you may just find a new way to relax.\r\nMany people think of classical music as an acquired taste. We \"acquire\" tastes for all kinds of music without realising it such as country, pop, raggea,and jazz but most people considers classical music difficult to appreciate. It is really quite a diverse field of music and there is a wide variety of classical styles.\r\n Meet other Classical musicians to practice and make music together. our space is large . Classical music is stimulating and contributes to cultural diversity. it's always nice to get together for this kind of music. this group is for Classical, Jazz and Blues We encourage adult musicians, especially pianists, to join. Beginners to advanced. Play a classical, blues, jazz or your own composition in a relaxed setting. Encourage members to play with other members, i.e., piano four hands or combinations of other instruments. We wish to reintroduce the practice of Hausmusik, house music, that is, music played by non-professionals or by professionals just for the fun of it. We admire professional musicians a great deal, but feel that music is far too important to leave it all up to them.musicians and singers.",

        "description": "<p>Fun walks and you walk at your own pace. 5k (1 hour) 10k (2 hours) ask at start table if you want to walk with another walker. Come and have fun.&nbsp; Below is the long story of our sport \"volkswalking or volksmarching\"&nbsp; Just a fun walk that kept the German name.&nbsp; Come out and have fun!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Please pay the walk fee of $3 to keep this site going.<\/p>\n<p>The Freestate Happy Wanderers and the Maryland Volkssport Association sponsors and pays for this site.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Freestate club is an active volksmarch club in Maryland and we sponsor non-competitive walking events (volksmarches) throughout the year. For information on all walks in Maryland and the metro area checkout <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mdvolks.org\/freestate\/\">www.mdvolks.org\/freestate\/<\/a> or&nbsp;go to our national website <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ava.org\">www.ava.org<\/a> to find walks all over the USA.&nbsp; At the ava.org site find Walking Events, then click on Maryland or state you are looking for a walk.<\/p>\n<p>Just a note to remind everyone that we post these walks for everyone to decide if they would like to attend.&nbsp; We are unable to attend all of the walks but other walkers at the volksmarches will be happy to explain our sport or wait at the sign-in table and someone would be glad to walk with you.&nbsp; We are always at the Freestate events so look for Bill or Linda.&nbsp; Thanks.<\/p>\n<p>The walks listed on the meet-up group are walks we will have members from Freestate attending. At each event we have a short trail that you can walk in about one (1) hour and we have a longer trail you can walk in about two (2) hours. OUR CLUB IS A MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN VOLKSSPORT ASSOCIATION (AVA), A NATIONAL, NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT PROMOTES AN AWARENESS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES. THE AVA IS AN AFFILIATE OF THE INTERNATIONAL VOLKSSPORT ASSOCIATION (IVV). FREESTATE IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE MARYLAND VOLKSSPORT ASSOCIATION EVENTS - OUR WALKING EVENTS, USUALLY SCHEDULED ON WEEKENDS, ARE NOT CONTESTS OF SPEED OR ENDURANCE. THEY ARE NOT PLEDGE WALKS. THEY ARE FUN WALKS TO DO BY YOURSELF, OR WITH YOUR FAMILY OR FRIENDS, AT YOUR OWN PACE. ADEQUATE TIME IS ALLOWED TO FINISH THE EVENT. YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT EVENTS IN LOCAL NEWSPAPERS, ON THE INTERNET, OR BY ATTENDING SCHEDULED EVENTS AND PICKING UP BROCHURES ABOUT UPCOMING WALKS. EVENTS ARE LISTED ON THE INTERNET WWW.AVA.ORG. Leisure Walking and Hiking FREESTATE HAS A CLUB NEWSLETTER AND SPONSORS SEVERAL SOCIAL FUNCTIONS DURING THE YEAR and GROUP WALKS.

OR FREESTATE\u2019S AT <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mdvolks.org\/freestate\/\">www.mdvolks.org\/freestate\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>WHY DO WE WALK? <br> FOR FITNESS, FUN AND FRIENDSHIP. OUR EVENTS GIVE PARTICIPANTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THINGS THEY MIGHT MISS IF THEY DROVE, RATHER THAN WALKED, THROUGH AN AREA. OUR WALKING EVENTS ARE MANY THINGS, BUT ABOVE ALL THEY ARE JOINING WITH OTHER PEOPLE \u2013 ON A TRAIL, THROUGH A PARK OR HISTORICAL AREAS, OR RIGHT IN YOUR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD --- FOR EXERCISE AND ENJOYMENT.<\/p>\n<p>WHAT\u2019S THE POINT? <br> OUR GOAL IS TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL FITNESS AND GOOD HEALTH BY ENCOURAGING EVERYONE TO PARTICIPATE. OUR ACTIVITIES ARE GEARED TOWARD PROVIDING WHOLESOME RECREATION AND EXERCISE FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS, AS INDIVIDUALS, GROUPS, AND FAMILIES.<\/p>\n<p>DO I HAVE TO WALK FAST? <br> WALK AT YOUR OWN PACE: GO AS FAST OR AS SLOW AS YOU WANT. RUN OR POWER WALK IF YOU WANT TO BE MORE AEROBIC. STROLL IF YOU WISH. STOP TO PICNIC, SHOP, OR SIGHTSEE IF YOU WANT. SOME PEOPLE WALK WITH THEIR DOGS. JOGGERS ALSO WELCOME.<\/p>\n<p>HOW FAR DO I HAVE TO WALK? HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE? <br> MOST WALKS ARE 6.2 MILES (10-KM). A SHORTER OPTION OF 3.1 MILES (5-KM) AT A MODERATE PACE, IT TAKES MOST PEOPLE TWO HOURS TO WALK 10-KM AND ONE HOUR TO WALK A 5-KM TRAIL. MORE DIFFICULT TRAILS TAKE LONGER. <br> DO WE WALK IN THE RAIN? <br> EVENTS ARE HELD RAIN OR SHINE, SO WALKERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO COME PREPARED FOR ANY KIND OF REASONABLE WEATHER. <br> WHAT DOES IT COST? <br> EACH WALK IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. EACH WALKER IS CHARGED A MODEST FEE FOR PARTICIPATION AT OUR EVENTS. THE FEE INCLUDES PARTICIPATION IN THE INTERNATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS PROGRAM, WHICH RECOGNIZES ATTAINMENT OF SPECIFIED LEVELS OF CUMULATIVE EVENT AND DISTANCE TOTALS. A COMMEMORATIVE EVENT AWARD IS SOMETIMES AVAILABLE. IT COSTS A FEW DOLLARS MORE TO PURCHASE. <br> COMPLETE THE DISTANCE AND REDEEM OFFICIAL RECORD BOOKS AT ESTABLISHED MILESTONES FOR AN ATTRACTIVE CERTIFICATE, PATCH, AND HATPIN TO RECOGNIZE YOUR ACHIEVEMENT. EVERYONE IS A WINNER! <br> EVENT RECORD BOOKS <br> STAMPED ONCE FOR EACH EVENT NO MATTER WHICH DISTANCE WALKED OR HOW MANY TIMES YOU COMPLETE THE TRAIL. REDEEM AT MILESTONES: 10 EVENTS, 30 EVENTS, 50 EVENTS, ETC. <br> AT EACH EVENT, BY PAYING THE MODEST CREDIT FEE OF $3 YOU GET BOTH BOOKS STAMPED AND PROVIDE FUNDS TO CONTINUE OUR WALKING SPORT.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p><span><b>WHAT:<\/b> This is primarily a&nbsp;<\/span><strong>SOCIAL VOLLEYBALL GROUP.&nbsp;<\/strong><span>We ideally play to have fun, be outside, get some exercise, and meet new people. We are not a \"league\". Players of various skill levels will pay on a court together, primarily in a 6v6 format, but may vary depending on the number of players in attendance. That said, \"beginner players\" (those with NO skills or who demonstrate an inability to play at even a basic level (i.e. don't or can't pass a ball) should likely consider other options, as such players greatly disrupt play.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Membership is $60\/season and all funds are used to obtain permitted access to Howard County Park &amp;&nbsp;<\/span>Recreation<span>&nbsp;facilities. We have a discounted arrangement with HoCo P&amp;R to purchase and donate&nbsp;<\/span>volleyball<span>&nbsp;court-related equipment in&nbsp;<\/span>exchange for permit access. New members have a 30-day trial period after which dues must be paid in order to continue to attend events.<\/p>\n<p><span>Note: If you are a player with a higher skill level (B\/BB, etc.) and are looking for more consistent, more competitive games, please visit <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/volleyballcolumbia\/pages\/More_Competitive-Organized_Play_Opportunities\">THIS PAGE<\/a><span> or contact Devon for information on leagues, tournaments, etc. in the area. <\/span><strong>DO NOT EXPECT TO COME TO THE MEETUP AND PLAY AT ANY SPECIFIC LEVEL<\/strong><span> (though having fun is a good expectation!)<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><strong>WHERE:<\/strong> We will be playing at Savage Park in Maryland for the 2015 season. Savage Park is located at 8400 Fair St., Savage, MD 20763. If necessary, we may play at additional HoCo venues, including Cedar Lane Park West and Centennial Park.<\/p>\n<p><strong>INCLEMENT WEATHER:<\/strong> If it rains or the weather is bad please check the Meetup page for that day - an organizer will usually post if cancelled.<\/p>\n<p> <br> <span><strong><span>Frequently Asked Questions<\/span><\/strong><\/span> <br> <span><span><span>I've never played volleyball before\/haven't played organized volleyball. Will anyone teach me\/help me?<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<ul> \n <p><span>No training is available\/there are no instructors for those with no\/limited skills - but other members tend to be helpful and offer tips on how to play. If there's enough interest \"newbie\" Meetups may be considered (contact an organizer if interested). Again - absolute \"beginner players\" will&nbsp;likely not find this group to be a good \"fit\".<\/span><\/p> \n<\/ul>\n<p><span><span>How many players can play at the same time?<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<ul> \n <p><span>With 2 courts, the max number of players able to play simultaneously are 24 (6v6). When more than 24 are present, we rotate additional players in on the service and the front hitting line (for an additional 2 players per side). In cases when there are greater than 32 players, teams of 6 may be formed and play will consist of either \"king of the court\" (winning team stays on until they lose) or \"2 games on, 1 game off\" (every team will play 2 games in a row, and then sit for at least 1 game). If we regularly have greater numbers of players attending, we will add additional events simultaneously at other venues.<\/span><\/p> \n<\/ul>",

The purpose of the group is to do just that, while getting exercise in a social setting that will allow all to enjoy the fun of biking or triking. We offer local rides just for our group as well as rides that are organized by other biking clubs, where we organize a day trip or even travel over a weekend to see other parts of Maryland or the mid-Atlantic. Hopefully something on our calendar will work for you. We also encourage members to suggest rides they think would interest the Klub. Come as little or as often as you like. So anyone interested in group rides on Kent Island, surrounding Queen Anne's County, Baltimore County, a ride across the Bay or an occasional day or weekend excursion to an organized cycling event&nbsp;should join this group. Happy trails and keep on pedaling.<\/p>\n<p>Helmets are required on all rides. Ride at your own risk.<\/p>",

In warm weather we meet at 5:00pm and in cooler weather we meet at 3:00pm. If it's raining then we don't meet that month. Our Meetup is held in the Agility Yard of the Happy Tails Pet Resort in Crownsville, MD. This is a large fenced in area so the Dachshunds can run free without worry. Water and poop bags will be supplied but feel free to bring whatever you need for your Doxie. We are an informal open group, but there are a couple of rules as follows:<\/p>\r\n<p>1. All friendly, well behaved Dachshunds are welcome. The dogs owner is responsible to watch their own dog(s) behavior.<\/p>\r\n<p>2. Please park along the fence for the Agility Yard and if walking your dog outside of the fenced-in area, please do not wander onto the private property of Happy Tails Pet Resort.<\/p>\r\n<p>3. Clean up your pup's poop. Bags will be supplied, and please remember we are guests here.<\/p>\r\n<p>4. Make sure all your pets shots are up to date. Also if your Doxie is sick leave them at home to heal.<\/p>\r\n<p>5. And last but not least, HAVE FUN and welcome to the Dippy Dachshund Group!!!!!!<\/p>",

There are plenty of interesting ale houses, beer halls, and brew pubs around DC, Maryland, and Northern Virginia and several breweries as well. We visit these venues, sample some of their beers, and do so in a way that respects the beverage, the craft, and each other. Anyone interested in tasting and learning about craft brews, and doing so in moderation, is invited to join. If you want to meet new people who enjoy a great pint, please join our group and come out to an event for some beers! We also have a Facebook group that can be found here:<\/p> \n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/344303879091196\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/344303879091196\/<\/a><\/p> \n<p>&lt;br&gt;<\/p> \n<p>Slainte!<\/p> \n<p>BCM &lt;br&gt;<\/p>",

We are a laid back group with no drama...not unless its on the 'big screen'...LOL! We will regularly check out new releases at surrounding Baltimore area theaters and relax afterwards at a nearby spot for good food, hearty dialogue and fun times. Depending on the movie, the discussion topics are bound to be endless. Movie times will vary from a movie and light dinner or a matinee and a late lunch.<\/p>\n<p>And because we are so much more than just movie lovers, we will get out and enjoy other interests, too - cultural events, festivals, comedy clubs, live music&nbsp;or maybe&nbsp;a play at a local theater.&nbsp; The sky is the limit!&nbsp; So, if you are up for some fun, have an open mind for stimulating conversation with positive people, then this is the \"crew\" for you. Good friendships are bound to happen while sharing what we love - MOVIES....&amp; More, too!<\/p>\n<p>Peace~<\/p>\n<p>P.S.&nbsp; Although members are not obligated to attend every event, we do want members who are active, open to making new friends and willing to share mutual interests.&nbsp; With that said, all you need to do is check out the calendar regularly, RSVP for events that grab your interest and fit your schedule and join us for some fun.&nbsp; (Wall flowers&nbsp;who are inactive after ninety days or have excessive no-shows will be removed from the group&nbsp;to make room for free spirits.)&nbsp; :-))<\/p>\n<p>We look forward to meeting you soon!<\/p>",

Go to places you only dreamed of, or thought you couldn't afford.\r\n\r\nThis is a serious travel group for travel enthusiasts.  However, the seasoned traveler, occasional traveler and even newbies are all welcome!\r\n\r\nMark Twain once remarked, in a critique of American isolationism, that \u201cbroad, wholesome, charitable views of... (people) and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one\u2019s lifetime.\u201d   \r\n\r\nThrough our travels, we hope to challenge and change you, opening up new ways for you to see and be in the world.  You will return home a \"global citizen\" seeing the world through \"new eyes\".  \r\n\r\nIn each trip we plan, there will be an opportunity to have a cultural exchange with the local people and when possible an opportunity to \"give back\" while creating lasting memories and connections to the locale and\/or the people.\r\n\r\nWe will also provide occasions to participate in a lot of fun, adventurous or relaxing travel trips.  So grab your family and friends or meet new acquaintances and take advantage of the opportunity to find that perfect travel buddy.",

        "description": "<p>The Graphic Novel Bookgroup reads in as wide a range as there are literary genres. The one commonality is that they all involve stories told with the aid of pictures - sequential storytelling. Obviously, this definition does not limit the content, and, if you were to browse several graphic novels, you\u2019d find striking variety: memoir, journalism, literary fiction, humor, experimental, abstract, underground comix, sketchbook\/journaling, superhero, mainstream, manga, manwha, the list goes on. Like any form of art, graphic novels often push the limits in terms of content and methodology\u2014engaging the reader\/viewer in the act of creating and communicating the story.<\/p>\n<p>From the popular and lauded to the obscure, we try to read and discuss books which offer enough of a substantial story to encourage discussion, disagreement, and criticism. We focus as much on the story (narrative and dialogue) as we do on the art (drawing style and layout of the frames). Our bookstore also is invested in increasing discussion of and interest in graphic novels, from panels with artists to participating in the Small Press eXpo (SPX) every year. The group is composed of young and old, male and female, those who\u2019ve spent their lives immersed in the genre and others who\u2019ve only read a few. Excellent graphic works are becoming increasingly available\u2014thanks to a growing readership and reviewers who are willing to praise this expanding field\u2014so come and join us, and read our recommendations at politics-prose.com\/graphic-novels.<\/p>",

Founded in 1971 as the \"Annapolis Ski Club\", we have also been known as the \"Crabtowne Ski Club\u2122\" and the \"Crabtowne Skiers\u2122\".<\/p>\n<p><span><strong>What We Do<\/strong><\/span> <br> Crabtowne year-round events span a wide range of interests. We are 'not just a ski club' we organize a variety of interesting events. Crabtowne has a long history of doing pretty much anything our members think will be fun: past events have included the areas listed above as well as golf, tennis, volleyball, touring as a group in various parts of the world, white water rafting, canoeing, hang gliding, flying sailplanes, hot air ballooning, and attending barnstorming air shows. If you think there is something fun (and reasonably legal) that the club could do, talk to a Board member or a committee chairperson to get the ball rolling. Bring us your ideas... let's start new traditions or reinvigorate old ones. <br> <br> <span><strong>Affiliations<\/strong><\/span> <br> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.skicouncil.com\/\">Blue Ridge Ski Council<\/a> (BRSC) affiliate - The Blue Ridge Ski Council sanctions certain ski trips (and some non-ski trips) that member clubs open to other club's members. Crabtowne members may participate in sanctioned ski trips run by other BRSC-affiliated ski clubs, without paying their additional non-membership fees.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>This group is dedicated to organizing gaming sessions, running the gamut from Eurogames to Wargames, with party games not unwelcome. Eurogames \"are a broad class of tabletop games that generally have simple rules, short to medium playing times, high levels of player interaction, and attractive physical components. The games emphasise strategy, downplay luck and conflict, lean towards economic rather than military themes, and usually keep all the players in the game until it ends... Their rulebooks are typically four to twelve pages long and playing times are on the order of 30 to 120 minutes. These games appeal to a wide range of ages, though generally not very young children. The audience includes casual gamers, who play with family and friends, as well as more serious hobby gamers\" (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/German-style_board_game). Adults only please. Parents are welcome to bring children if the kids won't disturb the festivities. We're happy to teach folks how to play a new game so don't fret if you haven't played one of these games before. Come on by for a fun time and to meet new folks!<\/p>",

Happiness comes from deep within, and not from people, situations, or circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>According to Researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of California, San Diego:<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;When an individual becomes happy, the network effect can be measured up to three degrees. One person&rsquo;s happiness triggers a chain reaction that benefits not only his friends, but his friends&rsquo; friends, and his friends&rsquo; friends&rsquo; friends. The effect lasts for up to one year.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Since whatever we focus on grows, the aim of this group is to help members focus on happiness and to spread it at every opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a happy person and want to socialize and network with other happy people, this is for you.

We pursue our mission through education, research, advocacy, and service activities. This Meetup is used for posting plant walks, monthly programs, and other events. The purpose of our walks is to identify plants. So we tend to stop frequently, looking closely at plants and not walking very far. No botany expertise is required. Walks are generally led by someone who has at least basic experience identifying plants and many are led by botanists with many years of field experience. Our monthly meetings are usually held at Kensington Library in Silver Spring on the last Tuesday of each month and feature a presentation on a topic related to native plants.

I also wanted to meet other people out there with the same interests who crave stimulating intellectual discussions.  I thought this group could serve as a way to motivate us to stay current on the latest literature and lead us into some fun discussions.\r\n\r\nYou should join this group if you are one of the many Washington area professionals (like me) who work in the international arena (US govt, World Bank, IMF, NGO, foreign embassy) or just someone with a passion for international affairs who wants to learn more and interact with like-minded people.  I miss the interesting discussions I used to have in grad school (SAIS) with people from all over the world, and I'd like to bring some of that back.\r\n\r\nSome of the books I'm interested in are:  Common Wealth by Jeffrey Sachs, The Bottom Billion by Paul Collier, the Post-American World by Fareed Zakarias, and Hot Flat and Crowded by Thomas Friedman.  These are just a few ideas and I am open to other suggestions.  Feel free to send me a message or post to the message board if you have any suggestions.\r\n\r\nI imagine meeting up about once a month at a convenient location.  Once we have enough members, we can vote on which book to read first.  Non-Americans are very welcome.  Let the intellectual stimulation begin!",

If it's raining then we don't meet that month. Our Meetup is held in the Agility Yard of the Happy Tails Pet Resort in Crownsville, MD. This is a large fenced in area so the Spaniels can run free without worry. Water and poop bags will be supplied but feel free to bring whatever you need for your Cavalier. We are an informal open group, but there are a couple of rules as follows:<\/p>\r\n<p>1. All friendly, well behaved Cavaliers are welcome. The dogs owner is responsible to watch their own dog(s) behavior.<\/p>\r\n<p>2. Please park along the fence for the Agility Yard and if walking your dog outside of the fenced-in area, please do not wander onto the private property of Happy Tails Pet Resort.<\/p>\r\n<p>3. Clean up your pup's poop. Bags will be supplied, and please remember we are guests here.<\/p>\r\n<p>4. Make sure all your pets shots are up to date. Also if your Cavalier is sick leave them at home to heal.<\/p>\r\n<p>5. And last but not least, HAVE FUN and welcome to The Crownsville Cavaliers Group!!!!!!<\/p>",

You are invited to come to the founder's home in Kensington\/Silver Spring, MD every Sunday\u00a0 from 2:00-5:00 (coming weekly is NOT mandatory) to get inspired, learn about other crafts and have fun. \"I have decided to do this in my home because, like the book club that meets here monthly (9th year) I can keep the meeting size to about 20 people, which is far more condusive to making friends and sharing than a large hall of 200 people\". We meet every Sunday from 2:00- 5:00 or later but attending weekly is not mandatory.<\/p>\n<p>Again, coming to every meeting is not mandatory (but hope you do).......this should be fun and not an obligation. I serve\u00a0hot tea,\u00a0coffee\u00a0and sodas with members bringing snacks like biscuits\/cookies\/scones, cheese and crackers, etc. to share along with good conversation and laughter.\u00a0\u00a0While\u00a0you work on your own projects, help each other with projects if you're stuck, learn a new skill (like knitting) and join in on beach retreats and weekend trips to workshops, shows, fairs, speciality shops, etc. for those interested.<\/p>\n<p>The Founder is a self employed business woman and artist\/crafts person......who loves knitting as well as\u00a0most of the needlework venues mentioned in first paragraph. She also pursues the arts in general: theater, music (Jazz, Rock, Blues, Opera, etc.), and galleries as well as antiqueing\/flea marketing, the beach, reading (personal and Book Club), traveling (including day and weekend adventures), taking art\/craft workshops, Indie and \"good\"movies, Jane Austen, cooking, etc. She and other\u00a0 women friends regularily do many of these activities together and are always open to new people joining in from the club.<\/p>\n<p>If interested, please write me a bit about yourself: needlework\/ craft interests, other interests, what projects do you want to finish, what do you do if you are still working, how old you are, what area you live in, etc. If you appear to be a good fit, I'll ask you to call me so we can talk a bit first to know each other a bit better.\u00a0I look forward to meeting you,<\/p>\n<p>Polly (Founder)<\/p>",

She is Professor Emeritus of History at the George Washington University where she pioneered the field of women's military studies and, since her retirement, a life coach, and EFT practitioner.<\/p>\n<p>Group members will have the opportunity to enroll in a six week training to eventually qualify as EFT practitioners.  The training uses the original Gary Craig videos and teaching materials.  In addition to studying and discussing these materials, participants will experience using EFT techniques in a group setting.

If you are going to be late please contact the group leader, we will wait 10 minutes for you if you let us know you are on the way.<\/p>\n<p>Dogs are welcome on the hikes where they are allowed. If you plan to bring your dog on a hike, please add a comment when you RSVP.<\/p>\n<p>Members are encouraged to have social events for the group as well. If you have a location or event you would like to suggest for members please contact the organizer or post to the message board.<\/p>\n<p>This group belongs to all the members. If you choose to organize a hike please, if necessary, state the competence level of the participants. If you RSVP to a hike please try to let the organizer know if your plans change.<\/p>\n<p>Additional Assistant organizers and hike leaders are welcome and encouraged. If you are interested in planning hikes please contact the organizer to be allowed access to the calendar. You can set the parameters of the hike be it urban hike, more rigorous hikes, or weekday hikes.

        "description": "Magical Godmother's Tapping Circle provides group life coaching for women using EFT\r\n\r\nEFT stands for \"Emotional Freedom Techniques.\"  It is a form of energy healing using acupressure points on the head, hand, and upper body to relieve physical and emotional pain.\r\nThe technique often works very rapidly\u2014in a matter of minutes--and is easy to learn.  Once you know where the energy points are located, you tap them with your fingertips while you are \u201ctuned in\u201d to whatever discomfort is bothering you.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of EFT is increased when a group of people tap together creating a group energy field of the sort athletes experience when the crowd in the stands is cheering for them.\r\n\r\nEFT has been used successfully on a wide variety of issues including grief, anger management, addictions, weight control, chronic aches and pains, phobias, and so much more that those who learn EFT are encouraged to \u201ctry it on everything.\u201d  \r\n\r\nMany people use EFT to support prayer, affirmations, and other spiritual practices.\r\n\r\nThe group organizer, Linda Grant DePauw, Ph.D. (a.k.a. Magical Godmother), is professor emeritus of history at the George Washington University professor where during a 33 year career, she pioneered the field of women's history.  Now retired, she is a Life Coach and EFT Practitioner.",

Because - let's face it -there just aren't a lot of ways for professional single men and women to meet. If you've done the online thing, speed-dating thing, or the blind date thing, then you know. This is just one more way to network with others and make some new friends.<\/p>\r\n<p>And you already know - the more people you meet, the better your chances for finding love. And if you lose a few pounds and inches in the process? Well that can't hurt, either!<\/p>\r\n<p>The program is for those who are in relatively good health, who are interested in improving their fitness level, overall health, and confidence. <br \/>It's about learning new things and having some fun, right? Besides - regardless of your current fitness level, we can help you IMPROVE!<\/p>\r\n<p>Take a risk and be willing to have a little fun. Bring your sense of humor and a great attitude.<\/p>\r\n<p>This group of for individuals who are look for an ALTERNATIVE from crowded gyms and loud clubs\/bars\/lounges. In fact, this might be the HEALTHIEST ALTERNATE to dating out there (less food, less alcohol, and better results).<\/p>\r\n<p>Members of this group MUST be:<\/p>\r\n<p>1) SINGLE (all age groups welcomed) <br \/>2) Have an interest in FTINESS (doesn't matter your fitness level, we all need to be more active.) <br \/>3) Interested in meeting other like-minded SINGLE individuals <br \/>4) Interested in having a great BOOTCAMP style workout in a care-free enviroment <br \/>5) Able to PASS our simple screening process for all applicants (don't worry just a few simple questions to preserve the \"quality\" of our group)<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Each SESSIONS begins with a brief warm-up (an opportunity to get ready for the workout, as well as size up the \"candidates\"). <br \/>The WORKOUTS are designed to have you paired up with a partner of opposite gender for a specific exercise. During the REST periods, you will be given an opportunity to find out about your partner before you resume workout. <br \/>You will have the opportunity to do at partner up with EACH participant of the opposite prior to the completion of the session.<\/p>\r\n<p>At end of the session, you will write down your top 3 \"interests\" and if they list your name also, then we have a MATCH! We will exchange the contact information you have provided us to your match. And the rest is between you and CUPID!<\/p>",

Now that Bobbi has stepped down, I am delighted to fill her very big shoes as the organizer for this group! For the same reason that Bobbi started this group, I would like to continue this group. I want to meet some interesting ladies and to build fantastic friendships that last a lifetime! The members in this group are usually from the White Marsh\/Towson area that are in their 30's and 40's who like to get out of the house and have fun. This group is inclusive of people that may not live in the White Marsh or Towson area or fall in that specific age range that was mentioned previously. We have a very active group that meets regularly for dinner and a monthly book club that is well attended. Whether its dinner, a movie, game night, a wine festival, or a road trip, I am sure we will find lots of fun and exciting things to do together. I am open for suggestions and there are quite a few assistant organizers in this group that I know will assist with planning some exciting things for the group. Best! Laurie<\/p>",

Our Washington, D.C. group meets on the second Sunday of each month.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Most months we have a discussion on a topic from Tarot or Qabalah, which is sometimes followed by a guided Qabalistic meditation. But some months there are special events, such as our Vibratory Attunement Ritual. See the Meetup event announcements below for details.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Newcomers are welcome to join in our discussions.

After completing the requisite initial coursework, members may request Initiation and thereafter participate in our healing ritual work of Pronaos.<\/p>",

Our activities include playdates, MNO and family get togethers. Whether you are a working mom or SAHM or a combination of both, we have plenty of activities to meet you needs! &nbsp;Even though we've grown a lot since 2010 we do our best to remain as close a group as possible.&nbsp;Feel free to jump right on in and RSVP or offer to host (we are always looking for new hosts and activities). &nbsp;If you have any&nbsp;ideas, questions, or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact any of the organizers. &nbsp;Again, welcome ... we can't wait to meet you and your little one!<\/p> \n<p>The Organizers! :)<\/p> \n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>FYI: This group is for mothers and their children. &nbsp;While we do often offer family activities this group is not open to nannies and their charges. &nbsp;We do not feel comfortable having children in our homes without a parent there. &nbsp;Thank you for understanding!<\/p>",

If yes, then grab a beer and join us! DC Theology Pub is an experimental conversation designed to foster fresh new perspectives on--and questions regarding--Christian spirituality in the 21st Century: it is part discussion group and part speaker series. Recently we have started to focus on book discussions on science and faith authors.&nbsp; But we still have general interest theological speakers talk about their perspectives on life and faith.&nbsp; We pick books and speakers who challenge us in one way or another.&nbsp; The Pub is for people of faith and people who struggle with faith...It's for people who are trying to figure out what life looks like at the intersection of spirituality, conversation, new ideas, science, justice, and the arts.<\/p>\n<p>Speakers include NPR journalist Barbara Bradley Hagerty, a planetary geologist, bestselling author &amp; justice activist Brian McLaren, and anti-nuclear activist Tyler Wigg-Stevenson of Two Futures Project.org.<\/p>\n<p>There are no right answers at DC Theology Pub, just good questions and better conversations. All viewpoints and backgrounds respected!<\/p>\n<p>DC Theology Pub is sponsored by Iona DC: A Christian Community, a group of DC residents who want to foster great conversations on faith &amp; doubt, and related topics in the District.&nbsp; For a different mix of theological conversations and a spiritual practices group, check out the organizer's other group, An Emerging Christianity Conversation in DC on meetup.<\/p>\n<p>Join the conversation!<\/p>\n<p>(Click on the <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/DC-Theology-Pub\/about\/\">Learn More About this Meetup Group<\/a><\/strong> link below for more detailed information on this group, the books, and the organizer)<\/p>",

This class is taught in interval style and is suitable for all fitness levels.<\/p>\n<p>Burn 800-1500 calories in 1-hour!! <br> <br> <br> <br> Decreases the impact on your joints by 80%!<\/p>\n<p>______________________________________Washington Post Article 2\/24\/12<\/p>\n<p><strong>Best for the trend-seeker looking to shed pounds: Kangoo Jumps at Laurel Community Center<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a Wednesday evening at the Laurel Community Center gymnasium, and I\u2019m wondering just what I\u2019ve gotten myself into. On the wall next to the basketball court looms a rack of the strangest footwear I have ever seen. Kangoo Jumps look a lot like ski boots, but they have an elliptical apparatus affixed to the soles that gives when you walk.<\/p>\n<p>This is where the \u201cjumps\u201d part comes in \u2014 you can jump as high as three feet with minimal impact to your joints. Balancing on the boots also develops core muscles. Spring-loaded boots were originally invented to help athletes recovering from leg injuries, and the Kangoo Jumps routine gained popularity in the late \u201990s.<\/p>\n<p>The class atmosphere is welcoming \u2014 a friendly group of women in their 30s on up. I\u2019m not the only first-timer here, either. A few of the women have brought their own Kangoo Jumps, which you can buy online for about $200. They clearly mean business, but they\u2019re happy to engage us fresh-faced newbies. Instructor Denise Pullet insists that balancing on Kangoo Jumps is easy and that no one has ever fallen in her class. She helps get me outfitted and literally holds my hand to pull me up to standing.<\/p>\n<p>At first, I feel awkward and off-balance. But as soon as we start jumping, I almost forget that these ridiculous-looking things on my feet are even there. The class consists of two segments \u2014 the first focuses on cardio and the second on strength. Lots of jumping in the first half definitely gets my heart pumping, and Pullet is tough but a good motivator through a series of difficult leg lifts at the end (the shoes act as a weight). Upbeat hip-hop and Latin music also helps. And come spring, Pullet takes classes outdoors for Kangoo Outdoor Bootcamp.<\/p>\n<p>The actual workout isn\u2019t much different than your average cardio routine, and the choreography is simple and mostly easy to follow. So what does Kangoo Jumps have on other, less bouncy workouts? Pullet says wearing Kangoo Jumps reduces 80 percent of the impact on your joints and helps burn as many as 1,000 calories per hour-long class. Plus, it\u2019s always nice to have a little extra spring in your step.<\/p>",

Thanks for the understanding.<\/p> \n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>We're a group of bridge players who meet every other Monday night for dinner, socializing and a few hands of bridge.<\/p> \n<p>We are non-competitive players, so none of this cut-throat, pounding on the table and hollering for the director, duplicate-style playing. Just some friendly, Chicago-style bridge. Like you played in your grandma's kitchen, but a little more grown-up than that.<\/p> \n<p>We are always willing to teach new players the basics. Really, little more than a knowledge of how many cards are in each suit is needed. But, bridge is a pretty complicated game, so expect to take a few weeks of practice to begin to get the hang of it.<\/p> \n<p>If you are interested, please feel free to reach out for the location of the next game. We generally have at least 8 players, though most don't RSVP through Meetup, so don't hesitate to reach out, even if you think we don't have enough players based on the RSVP. We would love to meet you.<\/p>",

Despu\u00e9s de 5 a\u00f1os, sigue siendo un espacio para encontrar gente que gusta del rock en espanol y para divertirnos en algunos conciertos pero durante este tiempo tambi\u00e9n nos hemos dato cuenta que hacen falta muchas cosas y que muchos solo ven. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Entonces, decidimos que el grupo ademas de compartir m\u00fasica, tenga un prop\u00f3sito.&nbsp;<span><span>Buscamos espacios para la m\u00fasica y arte de LatinoAmerica y Espa\u00f1a que no tienen mucha difusi\u00f3n por el&nbsp;<\/span>\u00e1rea<span>&nbsp;de DC. &nbsp;Eso es muy importante porque hay muchos&nbsp;<\/span>g\u00e9neros<span>&nbsp;que tienen&nbsp;<\/span>difusi\u00f3n sin limite<span>, los cuales preferimos no abordar ya que&nbsp;ya tienen muchos espacios donde se los puede escuchar. &nbsp; No es&nbsp;<\/span>cuesti\u00f3n<span>&nbsp;de gustos, es&nbsp;<\/span>cuesti\u00f3n<span>&nbsp;de&nbsp;crear&nbsp;<\/span>variedad<span>&nbsp;y armar un&nbsp;<\/span>men\u00fa<span>&nbsp;musical que verdaderamente refleje las opciones disponibles.&nbsp;Ademas,&nbsp;nos&nbsp;<\/span>gustar\u00eda encontrar<span>&nbsp;formas de poder acoplar toda esta m\u00fasica con la gran escena local que existe y todo esto para para que mas&nbsp;<\/span>j\u00f3venes<span>&nbsp;latinos del&nbsp;<\/span>\u00e1rea<span>&nbsp;tengan mas opciones en cuanto a las artes. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><span>Si estas metas te parecen interesantes y te&nbsp;<\/span>gustar\u00eda<span>&nbsp;contribuir, hazte miembro y&nbsp;<\/span>asiste a uno de nuestras reuniones. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Los meetups no solo son para eventos de rock en espanol, tambi\u00e9n son a eventos para conocer la escena local de m\u00fasica y arte en general. &nbsp;Ademas, se har\u00e1n todos los esfuerzos para que sean mas personales y podamos ir conoci\u00e9ndonos mejor. <br> <br>Los pagos mensuales no solo ser\u00e1n para pagar lo que los de Meetup imponen, tambi\u00e9n es para mejorar el grupo y lo mas importante, creemos que de esta manera, &nbsp;los que deciden continuar con la mensualidad, ser\u00e1n los que realmente quieren ver que el grupo crezca e incentivara a que estos miembros sean mas activos. <br> <br>Por menos de lo que cuesta una cerveza en un bar, nos comprometemos a lo siguiente: <br> <br>La concentraci\u00f3n todav\u00eda sera en el rock en espa\u00f1ol pero expandiremos el grupo para que se pueda compartir todo tipo de m\u00fasica y eventos interesantes en el area de DC (excepto relacionados a la m\u00fasica que ya tiene muchos medios donde se las puede escuchar) <br> <br>- Una vez al mes se enviara una playlist de 10 canciones multi-genero entre las cuales se encontraran varias bandas locales. <br> <br>- Una vez a la semana compartiremos lo que a nuestra opini\u00f3n es el mejor show local - en el cual nos podemos reunir. <br> <br>- Intentaremos tener reuniones una vez al mes para charlar de m\u00fasica y que podemos hacer para alcanzar las metas del grupo.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>La buena m\u00fasica y el activismo van de la mano.<\/p>\n<p>Las letras de las canciones siempre han estado ah\u00ed, pero si no se hace nada, son solo eso... lindas letras &nbsp; <br> <br>Para mas informaci\u00f3n visiten:<\/p>\n<p>RadioAlumbra.com<\/p>\n<p> <br> <br> <br> <br><\/p>",

Parental Alienation is a dangerous form of mental abuse....not just of the children or young adult children, but for the parent who is getting alienated.<\/p>\n<p>I feel very strongly about this terrible problem, whereas, the parent feels like they're not worthy, or you feel like your losing your mind. You don't want to give up, but everything you've tried fails.

Despite kettlebell showing up in retail stores, gyms, commercials, television shows, and magazines, I see <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><strong>A LOT<\/strong><\/span> of people using them incorrectly.\u00a0 Only a qualified professional should be teaching kettlebell technique, since the ballistic nature of many of the exercises could injure you <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><strong>IF<\/strong><\/span> performed incorrectly. However, once you learn proper technique and exercise performance, you will never want to put the kettlebell down.\u00a0 It will change your physique into the ripped and lean specimen that your friends and family will envy.\u00a0 You will shed serious fat and burn crazy calories, up to 1,200 per hour. Once you experience the results, and the fun in the training, you will never go back to anything else. Come try out a class for free.

Everyone is welcome!<\/p>\n<p>Our members meet regularly on Sundays, at the DC Eckankar Center at 3636 16th Street, NW, in Suite AG-48, Washington, DC 20010. We attend ECK Worship Services, Satsang Classes or participate in Book Discussions. Classes are held for the young ones too. There is also a number of fun activities planned throughout the year. We especially love to sing the HU Song - our Love Song to God, and to share with anyone who is interested, how they too can sing this wonderful song of love to bring themselves closer to God, for comfort in times of stress or distress, and of course when they're feeling full of joy, peace, happiness, love and\/or gratitude.<\/p>\n<p>You're invited to join us as often as you wish!<\/p>\n<p>We remember constantly that, We exist because God loves us!<\/p>",

He recently wrote <span>A New Kind of Christianity: 10 Questions that are Transforming the Faith<\/span> (2010).&nbsp; Brian returned again in June, 2011 when he spoke on \"Spiritual Practices for Today's 'Not Religious.'\"<\/p>\n<p>We love discussing Brian's books because they explore the hopeful possibilities inherent in Christian life &amp; spirituality; what this coming spirituality might look like, and how this \u201cemerging spirituality\u201d is challenging as well as reinvigorating conventional understandings of the Bible, spiritual practices, justice advocacy, God, Jesus' teaching, and Christian community. So if you are interested in exploring what may be a hopeful future for the Christian faith--join us!&nbsp; We are going to try to discuss and put these ideas in practice.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related opportunities:<\/strong> The organizer of \"An Emerging Christianity Conversation in DC\" also runs <strong><span>DC Theology Pub<\/span><\/strong> another meetup.com group that also sponsors theological discussions.&nbsp; The difference between the two is that DC Theology Pub sponsors a broader, and more eclectic, mix of speakers and books for folks interested in Christian Theology.&nbsp; You might want to join the DC Theology Pub meetup if you find you are not interested in the particular animating themes of Emerging Christianity but are still interested in hearing book authors talking about their new books on theology.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p><strong>For more information:<\/strong> Click on the<span><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Emerging-Christianity-Conversation\/about\/\">\"Learn more about this Meetup Group (click here)\"<\/a><\/strong><\/span> link below for more detailed information on this group, the 10 questions McLaren has identified as central to the future of Christianity, the books we'll be looking reading, and the organizer.&nbsp; These pages will help you see if you are asking the same questions that the Emerging Christianity movement is seeking to answer!&nbsp; Feel free to come to one or all of our speaker events and book discussions!<\/p>",

We appreciate the common ground and cross-pollination.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #f38897\"><strong>It's the connections without the labels.<\/strong><\/span> Adults (21 and over) of all genders, sexual orientations or relationship status are welcome.

And when they open on the inside through awareness that you see yourself as the divine-loving-light-being that you truly are!<\/p>\n<p><span>Thanks to Meetup cost changes, the decision was made to condense!<\/span><br>\n\n<span>See you next on January 24th at our main event, swim, spa, yoga and other vendors. You NEED NOT be nude, but this is an option as two of the supporting meetups are affiliated with the local MARNA.CLUB and AANR.com .

        "description": "<p>Forget business as \"usual\". This club is for real estate investors who want more out of a club than just passing out business cards with the hope that they connect with the right person or service.<\/p>\n<p>This is NOT a lead generation club or one of those business development-type networking meet-ups where you give a 1-2 minute sales pitch of your business followed by a lecture with training material for sale or back of the room products to promote. So if you are a Multi-level marketer, biz dev type, account rep or sales person, this club will not be a great fit for you.<\/p>\n<p>This club is about meeting people who can help you build a real estate business. Some members will have money to invest and some will have projects looking for investors. In this club, you will be able to create or join an investment group with other members. The purpose of investments groups is for like-minded members to freely share their investment ideals and offer advice on how to evaluate real estate deals for the best possible cash flow, profit margin and\/or return on investment (ROI).<\/p>\n<p>Our club aims to develop new ideas and solutions to the ever changing marketplace and then put them into practice for buying and selling real estate. We focus a lot on all types of deal structuring on land, single family, multi-family, rehabs and other property types. We promote the ideal of partnerships to acquire assets when buying alone is not an available option.<\/p>\n<p>Our club meets weekly for regular meetings and once a month for our Open Forum. Members are encouraged to present topics and solutions to the group during our Open Forums and discuss current real estate issues and offer suggestions and advice to other real estate investors seeking assistance. We invite industry professionals to speak at our open forums and we promote a simple motto \u201cone must create a mutually beneficial relationship with others in the industry to grow and expand\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>This club is not always about business. We occasionally meet socially for fun networking activities to foster deeper connections with one another. We support the ideal of the payment of dues to enhance our standing in the community by contributing our time and money and industry insight to charitable organizations.<\/p>\n<p>feel free to watch our video at <span><a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/I86DdhRdtYU\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color : #1b7fcc\">http:\/\/youtu.be\/I86DdhRdtYU<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<iframe src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/I86DdhRdtYU\" width=\"470\" height=\"264\" style=\"margin : 5px ; max-width : 700px ; max-height : 700px\"><\/iframe> \n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.jointventureptnr.com\/\">http:\/\/www.jointventureptnr.com\/<\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>",

This is predicated on the age-old idea of \"What goes around, comes around.\"<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left ; color : #333333\"><strong><br>\n\n Our Mission<\/strong><br>\n\n The mission of BNI is to help members increase their business through a structured, positive, and professional \"word-of-mouth\" program that enables them to develop long-term, meaningful relationships with quality business professionals.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left ; color : #333333\"><br>\n\n <strong>Belonging to BNI is like having dozens of sales people working for you...<\/strong><br>\n\n ...because all of them carry several copies of your business cards around with them. When they meet someone who could use your products or services, they take out your card and recommend you.* It's as simple as that! It's simple because it's based on a proven concept by BNI Founder, Dr. Ivan Misner, called \"Givers Gain\u00ae.\" If I give you business you'll give me business and we'll both benefit as a result.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left ; color : #333333\"><br>\n\n <strong>Last year alone, members of BNI passed 7.1 million referrals...<\/strong><br>\n\n ...which generated over $3.3 billion dollars (U.S.) worth of business for its members! BNI is a business and professional networking organization that allows only one person per professional classification or specialty to join a chapter.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left ; color : #333333\"><br>\n\n <strong>Would you like to increase your business by 20%, 30%, 50% or as much as 100%?<\/strong><br>\n\n You can see results like this! Many have. Some participants have added as many as 50 new clients in the first 2 years!!! Successful businesses depend on word-of-mouth. Word-of-mouth advertising is the best advertising there is.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left ; color : #333333\"><br>\n\n <strong>BNI provides a structured and supportive system of giving and receiving business.<\/strong><br>\n\n It does so by providing an environment in which you develop personal relationships with dozens of other qualified business professionals. By establishing this \"formal\" relationship with other people, you will have the opportunity to substantially increase your business.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left ; color : #333333\"><br>\n\n If you would like to be part of this and benefit from the strong business relationships developed between BNI members please come and visit us at one of our weekly meetings!<\/p>",

We've been at it for 13 years, at other locations and at VBH, a Great New Facility on Furnace Ave in Elkridge MD. This is laid back easy going folks who want a good fun workout. We have a lot of youth coaches and fathers of players who play with us. We have players with all skill levels, mostly in their 40's but we go from 30's to 60's. We have former pros and novices and loads in between. This is league play...you will have a regular team... not drop-in, but we will let you try it out if you are uncertain if it's for you. We play good soccer...but not hard physical challenges, this is not World Cup. Everyone gets to get up and go to work the next day! If you want lots of competition and glory this is not for you. Currently we have 60 members and play 3 games on Tuesday evening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : medium\">Our sessions are 9 weeks. We have 7 regular games and 2 assigned play game mixers where you will play with members from other teams to get to know more folks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : medium\">Any questions e-mail me at Puddledust@aol.com<\/span><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Our dialogue is an attempt to explore together the nature of the self and the profound questions of existence Krishnamurti raised as they relate to our daily lives. Krishnamurti\u2019s teachings are often referenced as a point of departure, but we are not attempting to promote any teacher or belief system. Inquiring together as a\u00a0group creates a mirror in which we can see our conditioning reflected as we expose ourselves to one another and to ourselves. At times it may resemble cognitive therapy or meditating out loud, but we use no techniques or practices, and the aim is not problem solving or self improvement but self discovery. Ultimately many of the questions raised come down to, \u201cWho am I?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Our dialogue is a self-inquiry among friends. In contrast to debate and discussion, dialogue is not a comparison of opinions or an attempt to convince another of a held conviction. We are questioning not to grasp an answer but to reveal and sweep away that which is not true. Avoiding quick responses and listening deeply both to the speaker and to one's own reactions may put our questions and opinions in a new light. Our group, which has been meeting for much longer than it has been listed in Meetup, has become safe enough to make ourselves quite vulnerable, allowing for honest and open sharing of our personal humanity.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\nWe usually begin with a silence that may go from 10 minutes to a half hour or more. It is helpful, if possible, to speak out of silence, and if not, to observe the busy mind. When the silence is broken by whoever wants to speak, we go around the circle and check in with a question, observation, or personal sharing. People who don't want to speak just pass. After the go around, the group is spontaneous. It is everyone's responsibility to facilitate the dialogue process, giving room for the quiet ones to participate, discouraging the talkers from dominating, and listening closely to all participants, including oneself, without judgment. This is a serious inquiry in which there is much laughter and affection.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\nUnless otherwise announced we meet on the second Sunday of every month. The doors open at 9:30 AM and the dialogue goes from 10 AM to 12:30 PM. Coffee, tea and light snacks are provided. There is no charge.<\/p>",

There are ten thousand starfish lying on the beach, how can you make a difference?&rdquo; She looks at him, picks up yet another starfish and places it into the sea; and responds to him &ldquo;Well it made a difference to that fish!&rdquo;. That is the spirit behind A.I.D. The problems of India are humongous, and it is easy to be overwhelmed by them. But the people who started the organizations believed that if they work with commitment, they can certainly make a difference to a few villages, and that is a beginning! Over time, they found that this spirit and commitment is also contagious! Many more people from the community started joining in;A.I.D. essentially grew out of the Washington Area Indian community!<\/p>",

This group is also ideal for stylist seeking to network with potential clients<\/p>\n<p> I am an D.I.Y hair specialist, I started braiding my own hair in 1993. <\/p>\n<p>My expertise is Crochet Weave and Crochet braids. I am the creator of Invisible Knot Free Crochet Weave (AKA Knotless Crochet Braids). This technique goes by multiple names on YouTube.&nbsp;I learned to cornrow at the age of 9 &amp; started doing my own hair by 13. I have always been an out of the box thinker. While learning to braid at the age of 9, I came up with a braiding system that teaches a person to braid in less than 30 mins. I have used my braiding system on over 20 people (including 2 men) to ensure the system works. I have had 100% success with all participants braiding comfortably, consistently on their own in 1.5 hrs.<br> I'm in the process of doing the patenting on the product &amp; it will be available for sale as soon as my attorney gives me the go ahead.

We will cover history, philosophy, social trends in Islamic history and compare the history of Islamic thought with Western ideals to find common grounds.\u00a0 The works of Islamic philosophers belong to a remote past but is a great place to understand the present conditions of the Islamic world. We will approach Islamic philosophy as an intellectual concern in its own right and cover the works of Averroes (Ibn Rushd), Ibn Al-Rawandi, Al-Razi, Ibn Tufayl, Ibn Masarrah, Al-Majriti, Ibn Bajjah, Al-Hallaj, Al-Ghazali, Ibn \u2018Arabi, Al-Nasafi, Al-Iji, Al-Jurjani and Al-Bajuri, and many other philosophers through time and history. This gorup is not religious or political. We will focus on intellectual discourse to understand and to learn\u00a0from\u00a0Islamic Philosophers.\u00a0 We will attempt to understand their view of the world as\u00a0 they knew it in the past and revive a very rich history of thought.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>This group is for Maryland (or anyone who doesn't mind driving) based Urban Explorers. We are people who like to go out in cities and sometimes rural settings and photograph abandoned or dilapidated buildings. We appreciate the history behind each of these buildings no matter how common they seem to most people. Often we find ourselves waking up at the crack of dawn to go road trip wherever necessary it is to go find these types of places. The experience often includes long walks or hikes and sometimes hopping the occasional fence if it means getting the shot we want. Most of our members are in 20s or 30s age range and come from many different backgrounds. We are based in Baltimore but have members from Southern Md, Virginia, Pa, and all over the place. Since we cover a lot of ground (usually the Mid-East Coast) we decided to expand our name to include this entire Mid-Atlantic region. The two types of events we usually host are day trips out to abandoned or run down spots or night shoots (usually around Maryland or Pennsylvania). However we are up for just about anything. Many members are also into Railfanning, Hiking, Mountain Biking, Camping, Rock Climbing and other activities we feel helps us with our exploring. We are all fans of history so the occasional museum is something we like to do as well. If you are a like minded person and want to come join us on these adventures sign up today!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Due to the fact many people who join seem confused about what exactly Urban Exploration is please read this Wikipedia article...<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Urban_exploration<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If any of the risks involved with UE are not for you than this is probably not a group you want to join.<\/p>",

We see so many misinformed people taking on Real Estate Investing in a challenging market without having the proper education or information. Our goal is to give you the tools needed to achieve success. My name is Nancy Sewell and I have been investing and wholesaling real estate since 2000. This is a great time to invest in Real Estate if it is done correctly. We are interested in networking with new and experienced Real Estate Investors that have one common goal. Making money is important but learning how to invest correctly and surrounding yourself with the right people are the keys to success. My partner and I wholesale approx. 80 deals per year and we also invest ourselves. The experience we gain from our own investments helps us to help our buyers achieve success. There are so many options in this market and most people do not take advantage of them because they have never learned the correct way from the right group of people. Our goal is to help investors make informed buying decisions in the right areas with the right exit strategy. Anybody interested in learning how to invest or wholesale real estate should sign up... and if you are experienced you will bring plenty of value&nbsp;too. Knowledge, experience, networking with a positive mindset is powerful and Real Estate is the vehicle that will get us all where we strive to be. &nbsp;Thanks for being part of a Meet up group that is doing what it takes to be successful right now and&nbsp;allow us to share our experiences with you!<\/p>",

This group will provide the opportunity for discussing current events and political issues from a classical liberal \/ paleoconservative \/ constitutionalist \/ libertarian point of view, and to support local and national political candidates who hold those views.<\/p>\n<p>This meetup will also serve as a venue for Ron Paul supporters from all political backgrounds to organize for 2012:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Quick facts on Ron Paul:<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Consistency<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p>Ron Paul has held the same views and positions for his entire career.&nbsp; You will not find any flip-flops like other politicians whose positions are available to the highest bidder.&nbsp; This is because Ron Paul follows a simple set of consistent principles that guide his policy.&nbsp; Ron Paul's voting record demonstrates his consistent philosophy promoting individual Liberty and Freedom.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>The Economy<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p>Predicted the recent financial collapse, and has solutions to prevent a re-occurrence in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Vehemently opposed the bailouts<\/p>\n<p>Has written several books on sound money and economics<\/p>\n<p>Never votes for an unbalanced budget<\/p>\n<p>Never votes for tax increases<\/p>\n<p>Opposes the federal reserve banks inflationary monetary policy (a hidden tax on those who save money)<\/p>\n<p>Has a plan to return to a balanced budget (It only requires adopting the fiscal year 2000 budget..&nbsp; Doesn't sound too difficult, right?)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>The Environment<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p>Strongly supports personal property rights (If someone pollutes your property, the offender must pay for damages and restoration) http:\/\/www.grist.org\/article\/paul1<\/p>\n<p>Supports removing all government subsidies (including those given to big oil, coal, polluting industries, etc.)<\/p>\n<p>Supports free market principles that encourage renewable and clean technologies to be developed<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Foreign Policy<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p>Is the only 2012 Presidential candidate to be a military veteran<\/p>\n<p>Is the only 2012 Presidential candidate to oppose our current foreign policy of policing the world<\/p>\n<p>Supported the use of Letters of Marque and Reprisal to authorize targeted strikes for the capture or kill of Bin Laden and other terrorists(like the one Obama authorized to Kill Bin Laden), without the need for endless wars and nation building in Iraq, Afghanistan, or Pakistan etc.<\/p>\n<p>Is the ONLY candidate who voted against the Iraq War FROM THE BEGINNING.<\/p>\n<p>Opposes giving military foreign aid<\/p>\n<p>Supports Israel's right to defend itself ( http:\/\/www.newsmax.com\/DougWead\/ron-paul-israel-garybauer\/2011\/04\/11\/id\/392440# )<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Healthcare<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p>30+ years practicing medicine as an OB\/GYN and has delivered over 4,000 babies<\/p>\n<p>Supports Health Freedom (Has introduced legislation to protect First Amendment rights of consumers to receive truthful information regarding the benefits of foods and dietary supplements and strike down the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) efforts to censor truthful health claims.)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Civil Liberties<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p>Is against Warrantless Wiretapping and other illegal searches (Always votes against the \"Patriot\" act, and FISA)<\/p>\n<p>Opposes REAL ID, Domestic surveillance, Imminent Domain<\/p>\n<p>Supports Home Schooling (He has introduced several pieces of legislation which would return to parents the freedom to teach their children at home and in the manner they think best. Additionally, he has introduced bills that would provide tax credits for American families to help pay for education expenses.)&nbsp; Paul has asserted that he does not think there should be any federal control over education and education should be handled at a local and state level.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>Would end the unconstitutional \"War on Drugs\" and decriminalize all drugs.&nbsp; He instead believes drug addicts deserve compassion and rehabilitation, not an endless, costly, and dehumanizing prison industry.<\/p>\n<p>Abortion; Paul has said that the ninth and tenth amendments to the U.S. Constitution do not grant the federal government any authority to legalize or ban abortion, stating that \"the federal government has no authority whatsoever to involve itself in the abortion issue.\"<\/p>\n<p>Gay marriage; Paul opposes all federal efforts to define marriage, whether defined as a union between one man and one woman, or defined as including anything else as well. He believes that recognizing or legislating marriages should be left to the states, and not subjected to \"judicial activism\".&nbsp; He has stated that in a best case scenario, governments would enforce contracts and grant divorces but otherwise have no say in marriage. Paul has also stated he doesn't want to interfere in the free association of two individuals in a social, sexual, and religious sense.&nbsp; Additionally, when asked if he was supportive of gay marriage Paul responded \"I am supportive of all voluntary associations and people can call it whatever they want.\"<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to keep and bear arms<\/strong>;\n<br \/>\n<br \/>The only 2008 presidential candidate to earn Gun Owners of America's A+ rating, Paul has been a lead sponsor of legislation in Congress attempting to maintain individual Second Amendment rights. He has also fought for the right of pilots to be armed.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>In the first chapter of his book, Freedom Under Siege, Paul argued that the purpose of the Second Amendment is to place a check on government tyranny, not to merely grant hunting rights or allow self-defense. When asked whether individuals should be allowed to own machine guns, Paul responded, \"Whether it's an automatic weapon or not is, I think, irrelevant.\" Paul believes that a weapons ban at the federal or state level does not work either. \"Of course true military-style automatic rifles remain widely available to criminals on the black market. So practically speaking, the assault weapons ban does nothing to make us safer.\" Rather, he sees school shootings, plane hijackings, and other such events as a result of prohibitions on self-defense.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Electability<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p>Has previously won 14 elections for Congress<\/p>\n<p>Has won the last 2 CPAC straw polls<\/p>\n<p>\"Grandfather\" of the Tea Party (In 2007 the grassroots raised $6.04 in the \"Tea Party 07\" money bomb, breaking records for the most of any candidates 1 day donations.)<\/p>\n<p>April 14 2011 Rasmussen poll puts Ron Paul 1% behind Obama in a head to head match up(41% vs. 42%. respectively), better then any other GOP contender.<\/p>\n<p>In Q1 2011, raised $3 million, more then any other candidate in that quarter<\/p>\n<p>Raised over $1 million in 24 hours on May 5th, during the first GOP debate of 2011.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Other positions are prevalent on Youtube and wikipedia http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Political_positions_of_Ron_Paul<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Related sites<\/strong>;<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.ronpaul2012.com\/who-is-ron-paul\/<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yCM_wQy4YVg<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.downsizedc.org<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.NaturalNews.com<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.LewRockwell.com<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.Mises.org<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.campaignforliberty.com\/<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.ronpaulforums.com<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Baltimore's Glamour Nude Photography Meetup Group is the region's premier model and photographer networking group. While we are often imitated, you will find no better combination of talented models, expert instruction, and an inviting, friendly atmosphere anywhere else.<\/p>\n<p>We bring you the nation's top glamour, fetish, and artistic models on a regular basis for both location and studio workshops. We have been running these informally for over a year, but it is time to make things easier on everyone now that the ranks of attendees has grown considerably.<\/p>\n<p>Our events are hardly the workshops put on by everyone else. We realize that your time and money is valuable and promise to never waste either of them. Have you attended workshops in the past that had great models but were unorganized and chaotic? You won't experience that here. -We will always bring in the very best models from around the country and right here at home. -We will always maintain a controlled shooting environment so that every photographer is guaranteed quality shooting time in the rotation. No \"gang-bangs\" or shoot-outs here. -We will always provide a friendly and fun atmosphere for everyone to shoot, network and learn new techniques. -We will always provide a meal, snacks and beverages for every event. -Professional lighting will always be provided. Simply bring your camera and a Pocket Wizard (if you have one, I have a couple to lend out) and you will be set. &nbsp; Our Meetup group is designed to allow photographers to share in the cost of bringing in top modeling talent so that they can improve their skills in a comfortable environment.<\/p>\n<p>There is a reason that we often have photographers drive hours to attend our events, and when you attend your first one you will realize the difference. Photographers of all skill levels are invited to join. We always enjoy a mix of amateur and experienced photographers at all of our events which always provides for great discussions and learning opportunities for all. Models who will be featured in upcoming events as well as those who wish to be considered among the best in the country are also welcomed to join. We will be holding model development workshops in the months ahead so that less experienced models can grow and learn under the advice of those with years of experience.<\/p>\n<p>Makeup artists\/Hair Stylist\/Wardrobe Designers\/Stylists are also welcomed to join our group. Your services are always needed and this group provides a tremendous networking opportunity. Initial Dues are set to $10\/year and will entitle members to bonuses such as: discounted event fees, bonus private sessions, preferential private shooting times, advance notice of upcoming events, extra shooting time and monthly prizes. We look forward to seeing all of you again at the many amazing events we have planned for the months ahead!!!<\/p>\n<p>So instead of wasting your time at other events who have used images shot here for their advertising, stick with the best. &nbsp;;)<\/p>",

There were talks in the past about taking the group over and keeping the original idea of Sexology Discussion alive, but things didn't work out.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nSince then, my wife and I have started our own group- DMV Sexuality Discussion Group. It is focused on the topics of Sex and Sexuality in our culture and how people in general need to be more open and talk more about it.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nI'm stepping up as temporary Organizer so that people who joined this group in hopes of finding a safe place to discuss these delicate topics will still have the opportunity to do so, albeit in another group. We do not intend to run two groups and thus the term temporary I mentioned above.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nWe'd like to invite members who are genuinely interested in these topics to come check us out and see if we can't continue this much needed conversation.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nPlease see here for more information:<br>\n\nhttp:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SexologyDiscussionGroup\/messages\/boards\/thread\/48553935<br>\n\n<br>\n\nBill<\/p>",

Everyone in the DC\/MD\/VA region are welcome to join!! <br> <\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Maryland Hiking Group is a local community of people living around the area. The group is all about meeting life long friends, building a sense of community, getting to know new people, keeping in touch with old friends, having fun, learning new things, engaging in new activities and growing as a person. We are genuine and we hope people who joins do the same that's how things should be in this world. We must follow the golden rule that is to be nice to each other especially the organizers.<\/p>\n<p>This group allows us to explore and try activities that we have never done before. We also want people to share, suggest and plan things that they enjoy in their free time. This group includes people who likes hiking, kayaking, going to the beach, biking, surfing, rafting, soccer, camping, fishing, snowboarding, skiing or just hanging out etc. This group belongs to all of us and we are all equal here whether you are a member or an organizer.

        "description": "<p>Welcome beginners and more experienced alike! For enthusiasts of Norwegian folk music and dance in the Baltimore-Washington-Frederick area. Our monthly Norwegian-style house parties have tasty potlucks, friendly company, and lively dancing. We share moves and sometimes have informal classes. Newbies are welcomed, encouraged, and otherwise assimilated. Out-of-town visitors are always a treat; if you plan ahead we can probably put you up at someone&rsquo;s house.<\/p>\n<p>What is our favorite dance? The springar from Telemark in Norway (telespringar) is a couple dance with a flavor of swing. For a peek at folks at a typical party doing the telespringar, see http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=F4Ltrt0Hxu0&amp;feature=player_profilepage .<\/p>\n<p>You can get out on the floor the first time: dance around doing the basic step either by yourself or with a partner, and have lovely dances with partners using just a few basic moves.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nMeanwhile try to listen to some Telespringar music, to get that asymmetrical pulse going in your head and your heart! (What asymmetrical pulse? You know how Viennese Waltz has an exhilarating lilt because they rush\/shorten the first beat and hang on the 2nd? Well, Springars are uneven like that, with distinctive regional differences. The Telespringar is unusual in that the 2nd beat is the heaviest\/longest, and from that the dancers spring forward\/upward a bit to the 3rd beat. How does this fit to the music?&nbsp; Listen to the tapping of the fiddler's feet: Most tap lightly on 1, then heavily on 2, then maybe a very light tap on 3. As with any dancing, it helps to hear the rhythm of the music and be able to pick out where \"1\" is, but don't worry--it's easier to feel it in a roomful of dancers.)<br>\n\n<br>\n\nCome dance!&nbsp; Or just listen to the mesmerizing cascade of notes and watch until eventually you're drawn to the floor....<\/p>\n<p>For more information about MAND see our website: <a href=\"http:\/\/mand.fanitull.org\/\">http:\/\/mand.fanitull.org<\/a>.<\/p>",

God has many faces and I see them every day. God is too big to fit in 1 book. God gave us a planet full of his tools and to be ignorant of them and how to use them feels like a waste. Mary his Choosen one and his wife is our Goddess, mother\u00a0and Queen of Heaven, their Son Jesus Christ\u00a0is our Lord and brother and the God of the Hunt. The Holy Spirit is the truth and the way. We have taken them all into our soul, mind, heart\u00a0and body and continue to do so everytime we give them\u00a0thanks and honor\u00a0and partake of Cakes and Ale, always returning some to\u00a0them.\u00a0We believe that one day we will go to the Heavenly Spring\/Summer Gardens and live there\u00a0until it is time for our reincarnation.\u00a0Have faith, not religion...Love and light...Namaste... Carpe Noctum and Blessed Be!!\u00a0<\/span> <span>\u00a0<\/span> <span>Special Thanks goes to: Brigid and Tiffany Ellen McDonald for use of their words. Thank you my Friends!<br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>",

It&rsquo;s designed for people who are serious about finding a partner and are ready for the REAL thing.&nbsp;The group&rsquo;s mission is to bring together great people who want more out of their lives and their partnerships with others. Does that sound good so far?<\/p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve all had relationships that didn&rsquo;t go the way we wanted them. I know I have...and at some point, I had to realize the only thing those relationships had in common was me. That&rsquo;s why I spent more than a dozen years after my own painful divorce learning from the best of the best in the field of relationships. It&rsquo;s also why I&rsquo;ve made it my mission to share with others the secrets I&rsquo;ve learned, too. The great news is that I&rsquo;ve had some outstanding success in helping my clients leave behind or transform relationships that kept them stuck. I&rsquo;ve watched them attract incredible new partners...get engaged...and even get married! Want to see for yourself?

        "description": "<p>Relationships are the most exciting, infuriating, wondrous, frustrating, loving, annoying parts of our lives! They just happen to also provide us with the greatest possibilities for where our lives can go. I created this group because talking to people about relationships is my passion. It's why I became a coach.<\/p>\n<p>When we talk about the relationships in our lives, whether they be our marriages, work relationships, relationship to money or success or failure, this is where we paint a picture of who we are in the world, where we belong and what we see as possible or not possible. There is no place that you can help someone more than if you help them with their relationships. There's no place we can learn more than in our relationships. And that is what we are going to do. Help each other with our relationships and learn.\u00a0 We'll support each other, offer our own wisdom and often just listen, because our relationships are also where we hide our concerns, fears and secrets. Just offering someone the chance to be heard can be the greatest gift.<\/p>\n<p>We will be discussing our own lives. This is not about TV relationships, celebrities or other distant projections. It's about what we know best, what we are going through and have been through ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>My job is to moderate the conversation and introduce concepts from the world of relationship coaching. \u00a0I will stay out of the way as much as I can, because communication is the number one medium for relationship, so we all might as well practice it together. The real meat of our group will be created by YOU. Without you, there's no conversation.\u00a0 So, bring your life, your appetite for conversation and your desire to support others and spend a few hours with us.<\/p>\n<p>Another wish is for this group to be populated by equal parts men and women. YourTango, the leading relationship advice site on the net estimates that 88% of their readership is women. Men are in relationships, too and the lack of conversation in the male community on the relationships of their lives gives us great material to work with. If you are a man reading this PLEASE join, because what you have to say and learn about relationships makes a difference for everyone, especially the women in the group.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, we'll need to observe strict confidentiality, so we can trust each other with such a sensitive part of our lives.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for your interest. I am also available for one-on-one, couple\/partnership or small group work in my private practice. This meetup group is meant as a community resource and a chance to do what I love with as many people as want to join the conversation and to do it in my backyard. I myself am a resident of Chevy Chase, DC.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you!<\/p>\n<p>Gregg DeMammos<\/p>",

I intend to publish soon (fingers crossed)...but in the meantime, I need to finish my book. &nbsp;I sincerely need to connect with other serious-minded fiction and non-fiction writers in Mitchellville, MD--to keep me focused. I discovered a few writers' groups in Virginia and lots in DC but want to stay in the MD suburbs so I don't have to venture too far from home on the weekends or after a long day's work. I'm serious about my craft and I'd like to meet with 7 to 9 folks twice a month or so we can keep each other on track, give moral support, etc. &nbsp;Is there anyone out there who will join me? I mean, I can't be the only writer in the Bowie\/Mitchellville area, can I? Ideally, we'll gather a diverse group of men and women at each meeting. Diverse perspectives seem to net the best insight and opinions regarding a person's work, I think. I propose we meet regularly, twice a month, at the Woodmore Town Center in the Wegman's cafe. We will encourage, provide constructive critiques, and inspire each other to reach our writing goals.<\/p>",

Breakfast starts at 7:15 and ends right at 8:30. They're\u00a0all about business. No boring business reports or long lectures.<\/span> <span><span><strong>We have an intentional\u00a0agenda<\/strong> that is geared toward giving and receiving referrals. Our visitors usually comment on the upbeat structure and the amount of qualified referrals that are exchanged. Business networking with intention.<\/span> <span><span>Once you have a home business networking Club (Hub Club),\u00a0<strong>you can visit other Gold Star Referral Clubs as much as you want<\/strong> as long as\u00a0your\u00a0industry is not already covered in that other\u00a0Club.\u00a0Your network opens to hundreds! The more members present, the more business that's passed. MEMBERS LOVE THIS! This is a BIG advantage.<\/span><\/span><\/span> <span>At Gold Star Clubs, there are\u00a0<strong>NO FINES.<\/strong><\/span> Other groups may fine you for being late, or for not giving a tip\/lead, or for missing a meeting. <span>Gold Star Directors\u00a0bring visitors to\u00a0your Club.\u00a0<strong>We help recruit<\/strong>, develop and maintain the numbers in your Club.<\/span> <span><strong>Membership Committees\u00a0do not discipline or censure other members<\/strong> or send them letters of warning or put them on probation or kick them out.<\/span> <span>The\u00a0<strong>exclusive \"Make it right\" Program<\/strong> developed by Gold Star Referral Clubs, manages conflict without disturbing a Club's positive environment. Any concern that needs attending to is done by a Membership Ambassador outside the Club, not by the business networking members.<\/span> <span><strong>We'll start a business networking referral group just about anywhere<\/strong>. If we can find 3-5 core members and a place to meet, we can get a club going. In other organizations, if your category is taken, like Lender or Realtor, you are just out of luck. Gold Star is always ready to start another Club for enthusiastic members.<\/span> <span>Our\u00a0<strong>absence policy is more understanding<\/strong> and we will grant a leave of absence for family and job-related reasons, not just medical.<\/span> <span><strong>We encourage you to become active in your local Chamber of Commerce<\/strong> and to attend open networking events in your area. Other groups can be\u00a0territorial and many frown on business networking with other organizations.<\/span> <span><strong>We educate, train and teach<\/strong> some of the most pro-active networking skills available. Networking Success Trainings\u00a0are available every month.\u00a0Gold Star corporate, based in Tulsa, OK, sends weekly business tips.<\/span> <span>Every week the\u00a0<strong>Club Business Coach teaches a networking success tip<\/strong> written by experienced, master networkers.<\/span> <span><strong>Being\u00a0a Leader is not like having a second job.<\/strong> Everything is online and easy to manage\u00a0in the Member's Room. Business networking leaders can step up and be recognized without putting in major hours.<\/span> <span>Last by not least,\u00a0<strong><span>we're different<\/span><\/strong>!\u00a0Gold Star Referral Club members have\u00a0<strong>contagiously upbeat<\/strong> and positive attitudes.

They are a fun and accessible way to play music in a group setting.<\/span><span><br>\n\n<\/span><\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">There are three types of drum circles:<br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\"><br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">1) Culturally specific drum circles in which the participants are expected to know and play certain rhythms from different parts of the world.<br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\"><br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">2) Non-facilitated drum circles in which the participants are encouraged to play whatever rhythms they choose, often creating them on the spot, and in which there is no leader or facilitator.<br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\"><br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">3) Facilitated drum circles in which the participants are encouraged to play whatever rhythms they choose, often making them up on the spot, and in which there is a trained drum circle facilitator who helps the group to achieve a higher level of musicality through gentle direction.<br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\"><br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">Carroll Rhythms uses this third model in all of its community drum circles. We often sustain our rhythms for twenty minutes or more. In addition, we play at a comfortable volume, we vary the tempo and types of rhythms we play, and we use a lot of different instruments. In the past, we've incorporated all instruments that people have brought to our drum circles, including:<br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">-djembes, ashikos, bougaraboos, cajons, congas, bongos, nadals, talking drums, riqs, doumbeks, djun djuns, buffalo drums, tars, and bodhrans<br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">-trumpets, saxophones, harmonicas, conch shells, didgeridoos, recorders, penny whistles, ocarinas, and flutes<br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">-shakers, rain sticks, and ocean drums<br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">-mbiras, berimbaus, and jaw harps<br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">-guitars, mandolins, dulcimers, harps, violins, and electric bass<br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">-glockenspiels, singing bowls, chimes, tambourines, hank drums, and bells<br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">-pianos, accordions, and keyboards<br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">-rasps, cabasas, and washboards<br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">-tongue drums, slit gongs, cajitas, clave, and udu<br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">-Boomwhackers<br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">-Theremin<br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\"><br>\n\n<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">We also encourage people to dance and sing!<\/span>",

We hold events around the greater Maryland, Washington D.C. and Northern Virginia metropolitan area and are actively initiating candidates. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Who Are You?<\/b> <br>This meetup is organized by<a href=\"http:\/\/www.williamblakeoto.org\"> William Blake Lodge<\/a>, the MD\/DC\/No VA branch of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oto-usa.org\">Ordo Templi Orientis <\/a>(The Order of Oriental Templars or The Order of Templars of the East or OTO). OTO is eclectic, drawing on both Eastern and Western mystical and esoteric traditions. <br><\/p>\n<p> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.williamblakeoto.org\">William Blake Lodge <\/a>has been continuously operating in the area since 1992 and is presently in its fourth generation of leadership. Our Lodge is named after artist, writer, poet &amp; mystic, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/William_Blake\">William Blake<\/a> (1757 - 1827), whose work provides a legacy embracing the core concepts of Thelemic philosophy, although he lived and died long before the 21st century. The <a href=\"http:\/\/oto-usa.org\/egc.html\">Gnostic Catholic Church or E.G.C.<\/a>, in fact, recognizes <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/William_Blake\">William Blake<\/a> as a notable link in that historic chain transmitting the light of the gnosis throughout the ages, and recognizes him as a gnostic saint. <br> <br><b>What Do You Do?<\/b> <br>CEREMONY: We engage in participatory rituals such as seasonal rituals for equinoxes, solstices and other holidays; celebrations of life experience such as baptisms, confirmations, weddings and deaths; elemental, planetary, angelic and kabbalistic rituals; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MD-DC-NoVA-Thelema-and-Magick\/pages\/Major_Rituals_of_Thelema\/\">classic ceremonial magick rituals<\/a>; original rituals created by initiates; and especially <a href=\"http:\/\/hermetic.com\/sabazius\/gnostic_mass.htm\">The Gnostic Mass<\/a>, OTO's central rite. <br> <br>INITIATION: We provide initiation as a catalyst for one's personal development. In your initiation, you are the star of the show. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MD-DC-NoVA-Thelema-and-Magick\/pages\/Are_You_Interested_in_Initiation_into_O.T.O.%3F\/\">Are You Interested in Initiation into O.T.O.?<\/a>. <br> <br>EDUCATION: We provide classes and workshops on subjects such as alchemy, ceremonial magick, Enochian, god forms, history, herbalism, hermetic science, initiation symbolism, meditation, scientific illuminism, occult studies, kabbalah, free thought, experimental arts, ritual practices, sacred sexuality, Tarot, yoga, and more. <br> <br>FRATERNITY: We are a community of women and men who come together to share our experiences, discuss occult and esoteric philosophy, share our knowledge and skills, celebrate together, argue together, dine together and laugh together. Fraternity is more than friendship; it is a bond forged by OTO initiates all over the world based upon common experiences and similar points of view with a commitment to peace, truth, mutual respect, tolerance and brotherhood. <br> <br><b>How Can I Check You Out?<\/b> <br>Most of our events are open to guests. Please note that it is NOT a requirement to join OTO to attend our open meetings and events. We're happy to have folks who just enjoy their status as our guests, attend our events and spend time with us. We ask for donations or charge fees to help us with our operating expenses. <br> <br>William Blake Lodge is moving into its 23rd year of operation in June of 2015 and has remained a continuously active part of the MD\/DC\/No VA esoteric community. WBL has also realized its efforts of moving out of living rooms, basements and bookstores by maintaining a permanent, community-supported <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MD-DC-NoVA-Thelema-and-Magick\/photos\/4684832\/\">temple<\/a> in Baltimore since 2008. The majority of our events are held at this location. Our space is 2367 sq ft and includes a temple, a full kitchen, 3 bathrooms, a sitting area, a classroom area, and storage. We also maintain a large library of many titles in magick, philosophy, esoterica and the occult. See the pics of our temple space and events in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MD-DC-NoVA-Thelema-and-Magick\/photos\/\">photos<\/a> section. <br> <br>We invite you to attend our open events.

Have you ever asked yourself &ldquo;Is this all there is?&rdquo; Whether life has been pain and suffering or you have achieved everything you wanted, still there is within us that feeling that there must be something more. Something beneath the surface that gives life a deeper meaning. A suspicion, that, when you leave this life, you will say &ldquo;Ah hah! I knew it! It was there all along and I never even put in 80% effort.&rdquo; We are, all of us, teachers to one another, mirrors of ourselves. Life is our teacher, the macrocosm which offers opportunities to receive its&rsquo; beauty and magic by simply being human.

        "description": "<p><strong>WELCOME TO THE 5RHYTHMS\u00ae<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Created by Gabrielle Roth and practiced by tens of thousands worldwide, 5Rhythms\u00ae is a philosophy, perspective, performance art and a dynamic movement practice rooted in the principle that if you put the psyche in motion it will heal itself. Movement is both the medicine and the metaphor, reaching across all languages, cultures and age groups to transform suffering into art, art into awareness, and awareness into action. Wherever the 5Rhythms are practiced, a community is born to dance, to sweat, to change, to support, and to provide a safe space for each of us to shatter the ego\u2019s hold and awaken the juicy, unpredictable, fascinating, edge-walking, rock star part of ourselves that yearns to be free.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Creativity. Connection. Community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The 5Rhythms\u00ae of Flowing, Staccato, Chaos, Lyrical, and Stillness form \u2018The Wave\u2019, a simple movement meditation practice that encourages us to find our own dance of embodied feeling and to discover ourselves at our most fluid and creative level, bringing more of ourselves \u2013body, heart, mind &amp; soul- into movement, on the dance floor &amp; out in the world. There are no steps to learn and it can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of age, fitness, ability, or experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>There are currently two classes a month in Baltimore, on the 2nd &amp; 4th Sundays<\/span> <span>3.00 - 5.00 pm in Charles Village led by Richard Jerram. See also his new Website <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/danceintolife5rhythms.wordpress.com\">Dance Into Life<\/a>&nbsp;<\/strong>which has details of other&nbsp;classes in DC and in Bethesda as well as more about the practice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Check this site &amp; look out for email notifications about extra classes &amp; any schedule changes (they happen!).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Workshops: Every two months, approximately, often at the Baltimore Waldorf School in Cold Spring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Many come to these classes by word-of-mouth and they are also advertised on Facebook etc, so not all attenders have joined the MeetUp. RSVPs can be helpful, but are not necessary!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>You can find feedback from dancers under 'Past' and 'Recent Meetups' (we never rate classes ourselves).<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

        "description": "<p><span style=\"font-size : medium\"><span style=\"color : #000000\">Second Half Rally is a group for experienced life veterans who like active recreation and sharing good times together.<\/span><\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">We enjoy activities such as biking, kayaking, group walks,<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">festivals, concerts,<\/span> <span style=\"font-size : medium\">exploring cool places<\/span><span style=\"color : #000000\">, and sharing good eats &amp; drinks.<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : medium\">Our one simple goal is to have FUN!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : medium\">We chose the name Second Half Rally because all of us share that life situation chronologically, even though we don\u2019t feel like it. But you probably qualify if you have some gray hair, you OUGHT to have some gray hair, you\u2019ve forgotten your real hair color, or the Men\u2019s Hair Club has your number on speed dial. If you\u2019re basically a kid who wants to go outside and have fun playing with friends, then you'll fit in with our group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : medium\">Membership in Second Half Rally is FREE. If you don't like something, just remember that you get what you pay for...<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : medium\">Check the event calendar regularly as it keeps growing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : center\"><span style=\"color : #ff0000 ; font-size : large\"><em><strong>\"Put me in coach! \u00a0I\u2019m ready to play... \u00a0TODAY!\u201d<\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #0000ff ; font-size : medium\"><strong>WHY SECOND HALF RALLY?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : medium\">Life is the ultimate participation sport, and we\u2019re all in the game whether we like it or not. During the first half of living in this world, it\u2019s common to make rookie mistakes, sign a long-term contract with the wrong team, be stuck on the sideline training young recruits, or suffer game-changing injuries to body, mind, and spirit. To make up for missed opportunities and bone-headed plays, most of us need to step up our game as we take the field for the second half of our lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : medium\">In short, we need to stage a strong Second Half Rally! That means coming up with a better game plan, getting off the bench, and playing harder with a winning attitude. In this group, you'll be playing with other winners who share the same gusto and adventuresome spirit!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #0000ff ; font-size : medium\"><strong>OUR GAME PLAN FOR ACTIVE FUN<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : medium\">The Second Half Rally meetup group has a straightforward game plan that respects the intelligence, maturity, and independence of its members:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : medium\"><strong>1.<\/strong> Our primary goal at every event is to HAVE FUN. Then we do something active to make it happen. Other groups tend to focus primarily on doing a specific activity like biking, hiking, or kayaking led by serious aficionados. Too often, they never get around to having fun. Second Half Rally has its priorities straight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : medium\"><strong>2.<\/strong> We don\u2019t tell our members how to have fun. Each event starts with an interesting idea, and then people figure out how to have the most fun. It always works out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : medium\"><strong>3.<\/strong> All of our activities are aimed at regular people who enjoy an active lifestyle for recreation. We pedal, paddle, and hike at a reasonable pace that works for anyone in decent shape. We don\u2019t run endurance races or competitions, and we take reasonable rest breaks. You don\u2019t need to be an athlete or a hardbody to participate, but you must be able to keep up with everyone else. This is not a group for couch potatoes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : medium\"><strong>4.<\/strong> Depending on the location, our events start at 10:00 am or later to give people enough time to get there, be relaxed, and enjoy themselves. Beginning at a civilized time is part of having fun on a weekend. Unlike some outdoor activity groups, we don\u2019t wake up the chickens when we leave home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : medium\"><strong>5.<\/strong> We always accompany our events with good food and drinks. Taking time for refreshments and socializing with other members is an important way to make friends with people who share our interests.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : medium\"><strong>6.<\/strong> With this group, there\u2019s no need to RSVP \u201cNo\u201d unless you change your plans. Nobody expects you to show up at a specific event unless you RSVP \u201cYes\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : medium\"><strong>7.<\/strong> All members post a clear personal photo showing their face so we can recognize each other at meetups to help build a comfortable sense of community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : medium\"><strong>8.<\/strong> Our group is friendly and welcoming, but we don\u2019t tolerate whiners, jerks, dorks, or anyone else who spoils the fun for the rest of us. People who don't fit with the group are quickly removed from membership.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : center\"><span style=\"color : #ff0000 ; font-size : large\"><em><strong>We still boogie! \u00a0Do you? \u00a0If so, then join up!<\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : center\"><em><strong><span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : small\"><br>\n\n<\/span><\/strong><\/em><\/p>",

You don't need to be an expert.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n We do also hang out outside of the Bible Talk, showing how fun it is to be a Christian! Some of these events will be posted here.

I want to start a similar group in the DC area because I know we have many great writers in the area as well. So here we are. The group brings together writers of all ages and from all walks of life. Whether you are a new writer or have published, all are welcome. &nbsp;If writing is your life, search for a group no longer. &nbsp;The format is writers will bring no more than four typed double spaced pages to read out loud for comments and feedback. &nbsp;Please check the website each week to see how many attendees there are, so that you can bring copies so that we may read along with you. The meetings are held at the La Madeleine in Bethesda<span>&nbsp;on Old Georgetown Road. &nbsp;La Madeleine is across the street from the &nbsp;Bethesda Metro . &nbsp;We usually sit in the last dining room, towards the back of the cafe at one of the larger wooden tables tables shuffling papers about. &nbsp;Hope to see you there!<\/span><\/p>",

Young Harley riders in the area seem few and far between compared to the amount of young riders on sportbikes. This group is dedicated to bringing the young guys and gals on Harleys together for some good fun on local backroads and maybe some rides out to rallies if people are interested. You do not have to be from DC to be a member of this group. Our rides will take us outside of the city and surrounding areas but will start in locations central to the DC metro area. Whether you are from Maryland, Virginia, DC\u00a0Pennsylvania or West Virginia, sign up and try to make it out for a couple rides or meetups. Also Harley riders tend to have a rep for being an intimidating crowd. I want this group to be more laid back and chill. No front necessary. Just a desire to come out and have fun no matter who you are!<\/p>",

The purpose of this group is to create a network of people who would like to help make a difference in helping dogs with rescue groups get exercise, socialization, and eventually adoption. You should join if you have a love for animals, and would like to spend some time improving the lives of some beautiful, loving, but homeless dogs. You can devote a much time as you wish to make it work within the framework of your life. &nbsp;We hope to set up a number of meetups in which we will be taking dogs to events in the area, and getting them exposure for finding their \"forever\" homes.<\/p>",

Talk to us about them and see who else might be interested.<\/span> <br> <\/p>\n<p>So, you probably know there are other ASL groups out there. &nbsp;What's special about this one?<\/p>\n<p>- IT'S FREE! &nbsp;There's been a lot of discussion lately about Meetup costs and asking members for donations. &nbsp;Not here. &nbsp;This is a hobby of mine and will stay that way until meetup.com decides I have too may members and tries to charge me extra. &nbsp;In fact, if Meetup _EVER_ asks you for money on behalf of City Life ASL, please let me know. &nbsp;I've instructed them not to.<\/p>\n<p>- Beginners rule! I'm getting a little better myself, but still have some learning curve issues. &nbsp;I try to keep a \"beginner's mind\" about it. It's a fun way to communicate. I'm not studying to be an interpreter, I'm not on a schedule or in a hurry, and this is not a part of my professional life.<\/p>\n<p>- I\u2019d like to see more events at local hangouts in Baltimore, rather than in malls or near DC.<\/p>\n<p>- Many events out there are too far away and too early in the morning for my sleepy weekends!<\/p>\n<p>- ASL Immersion is not a requirement \u2013 it\u2019s a great method, but plenty of folks are already doing that. We're open to the discussions and questions that hearing people have when they're trying to understand ASL better. &nbsp;And practice. &nbsp;Always more practice.<\/p>\n<p>- All levels are welcome, but be willing to help. If you're an advanced signer, please adjust to your audience. The goal is for everyone to communicate, learn and practice, not to be the best signer in the room. :)<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for visiting, and come on out! No special invitations or requirements needed, but please join the group to follow the schedule and get reminders. &nbsp;I look forward to meeting-up with you!<\/p>\n<p> <br> <\/p>",

I am open to suggestions but some of our meetups will include attending plays (locally and in NYC), movies, sports events, karaoke, Christian singles events(conferences, discussions,etc.) amusement parks, and definitely eating...lots of eating!!!! If you think this is the group for you, join and check us out!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Additional Information:<\/p>\n<p><strong>To be added to the group upon request, please answer the questions listed, please make sure there is a picture of you on your profile, and lastly, please be a SINGLE CHRISTIAN who is in or close to (3-5 years) the age range for the group.

Once added, please join our Facebook group, this meetup group will transition completely to Facebook by the end of the summer and I don't want anybody left behind.<\/strong><\/p>",

The Baltimore Ramblers became a Charter Member in 1929. Throughout our history, we have been a touring club. Our goal is to promote Motorcycling and Motorcycle Safety. The Ramblers are a multi-brand club. Owners of all road bikes big, and small, are welcome to join us as members or just come along on one of our rides. Meetings are held at 8PM on the first and third Wednesday of the month at 5513 Deer Park Road, Reisterstown, MD 21136 (near Soldiers Delight convenient to Rt. 26, Rt. 140 &amp; 795). Some rides will be announced on Meetup but we have a schedule full of rides and events, so the best way to learn about us it to attend one of our meetings or social nights.<\/p>",

The aim is for babies, toddlers and little ones (up to age 5) to meet and have fun, the parents to share tips and experiences, and hopefully build new friendships all round! The group is open to stay at home and part-time working parents in their 20s, 30s, and 40s as we all have something to offer! If you are currently pregnant with your first, please come back and join us after your little one is born.<\/p>\n<p>Please note the following:<\/p>\n<p>- In order to keep the group active and intimate, we are currently only accepting membership from those in and&nbsp;around DC metro accessible areas<\/p>\n<p>- This group is for those seriously looking to meet other mamas and papas&nbsp;on a regular rather than adhoc&nbsp;basis.<\/p>\n<p>- New members will need to provide a profile picture of themselves before being accepted into the group so we can identify you at meetups.&nbsp;A clear picture of yourself, or&nbsp;you with your little one is acceptable.<\/p>\n<p>- There is a $15 yearly membership fee to cover meetup costs. This is to keep the group active and allow mamas and papas, and the little ones to build bonds and long lasting friendship. Anything over will be used for paid member events. We don't plan on being the biggest Moms and Dads group in DC, but we do plan on being the friendliest, building real and meaningful relationships between members and our children.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

Young, David Walker began this&nbsp; reading club to challenge himself to read (opposed to pacifying&nbsp;his mind with computers, TV, and movies). He was in the library club in elementary school, and&nbsp;he lost the joy of reading leisurely. 'The Shack' renewed&nbsp;his interest!! Most books&nbsp;he read can be read within a week for those who make reading a priority. With an abundance of obligations (i.e. church, work, school, [oh yeah... and self]), it took him&nbsp;a little longer to complete a novel. If this is your plight as well, join my quest for education. We'll meet at pre-determined location to discuss the book.<\/p>\n<p>The group is made up of people who like to read.&nbsp; All members are encouraged to come to the discussions even if you have not finished or read the book.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>30 years old in 2014, you can get over two dozen different holistic treatments at Ruscombe.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nEach practitioner is in private practice in their own office inside one of the two buildings, so you make your appointments with them. There is a complete list of modalities offered on their website under \"Select Practitioner\" and each practitioner under that has a webpage of their own on the site explaining what they do, their training and credentials, etc. all are fully licensed. Many of the practitioners have decades in practice and are just flat out \"Rockstars\" at what they do.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nThe grounds are historic and peaceful with gardens and a lily pond. There is a parking lot and plenty of street parking too. They also offer classes and workshops like Reiki, Yoga, Tai Chi and other movement or mediation\/spiritual methods - see the website or their MeetUp group \"Ruscombe Mansion\" for these. You can also rent spaces for your group to meet or to teach your workshops\/classes.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nIf you have never tried holistic healing this is a great place to get more information and pick a modality or treatment that may be right for you. Join Ruscombe clients, practitioners and staff for a Open House on October 12, 2014 where they will have demos and you can meet and talk with holistic practitioners, vegetarian food, kids welcomed. Ruscombe Mansion in Baltimore offers programs to educate the public about holistic and complementary health information. There is a Central Office where they carry homeopathic remedies and one can call Central Office Coordinator Helen B. for info at 410-367-7300 (Tue-Fri 10A - 3PM). They have a vegetarian co-op cafe during the school year (the menu for the week will be on the website) . Rental spaces for movement classes, meetings and cooking classes are available.<\/p>",

Then it may be helpful to take a closer look at the thoughts you are believing.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #3366ff\"><em>I have found that when I believe my thoughts, I suffer, but when I question them, I don\u2019t suffer. And I\u2019ve come to see that this is true for every human being.<\/em><\/span> -Byron Katie<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #3366ff\"><strong>The Work of Byron Katie<\/strong><\/span> is a way to clear the mind and end confusion.\u00a0With The Work we\u00a0identify stressful thoughts, question them through inquiry, and move from confusion to understanding. With this understanding, we stop believing thoughts that cause us discomfort. We become free and our life experience dramatically shifts.<\/p>\n<p>As\u00a0a graduate of the School for the Work taught by Byron Katie, I have experienced the profound insights that can arise from inquiry, and the freedom that comes with it. This group is for anyone interested in practicing this simple yet powerful method of questioning stressful thoughts. You'll learn to ask yourself the four simple questions of The Work, do the turnarounds (to experience the opposite of what you believe), and\u00a0find your own truth.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about The Work, please visit <strong><span style=\"color : #3366ff\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thework.com\">www.thework.com<\/a>.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Recommended Reading: <strong><span style=\"color : #3366ff\"><em>Loving What Is<\/em><\/span><\/strong> by Byron Katie.<\/p>\n<p>The truth sets us free.\u00a0In this group we\u00a0support each other in finding our own freedom.

We teach Modern Wushu, Traditional Kung Fu, and Chinese Style Kickboxing.\u00a0 One day we will have a Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) program too.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone is welcome whether you'd like to practice for fitness, self-defense, competition, or for mastery.\u00a0 Our classes to improve your fitness, flexibility, athleticism, and Martial Arts foundation.\u00a0 Lessons learned in this class can be applied to other Martial Arts and styles.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Meaning of Wushu:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n Chinese Martial Arts is usually referred to as \"Wushu\", meaning literally \"Martial Arts\", in Chinese or \"Kung Fu\", which means \"Accomplishment through hard work and discipline\" (the meaning of Kung Fu is more generic and can refer to a high level of skill or accomplishment in any practice including cooking, music, painting, carpentry etc.).\u00a0 Trademarks of Chinese Martial Arts include movements that involve circles that develops momentum, speed, and fluidity.\u00a0\u00a0 Also, TCM (Traditional Chinese Martial Arts) usually does not require the practitioner to be physically stronger or larger than his\/her opponent, but rather emphasizes neutralizing or redirecting an opponent's force rather than using force against force.\u00a0 A third trademark is the emphasis on developing low and strong stances that are held for a long duration of time.\u00a0 This type of training, though many people are outdated, develops the practitioner's strength, firmness of foot, overall Martial Arts foundation, and functional Martial power.\u00a0 There are hundreds if not thousands of different styles of Chinese Martial Arts which vary in approach and application.\u00a0 To find a comprehensive look at Chinese Martial Arts try to Youtube the series: Kung Fu Quest Season 1 &amp; 2.\u00a0 Though the TV series is in Cantonese Chinese and produced in Hong Kong, the lessons and sparring sessions and two man exercises demonstrate the approach and effectiveness of Chinese Martial Arts.\u00a0 Have a nice day!\u00a0 Also, read my bio if I've not bored you to death already! :)<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Background of Instructor<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p><span>Coach Ching-Yin \"Bee\" Lee has been training in Chinese Martial Arts for almost 20 years, and has been coaching for 10 years.

        "description": "<p>Having suffered from Fibromyalgia for over nine years I have found a huge need for face to face real human support from others who also suffer from Fibromyalgia. There is not one specific Fibromyalgia group within the Carroll County area. Depending on the outcome of our first couple meetings we will be changing this tragedy. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in 2006 (but was diagnosed correctly after three years of misdiagnoses), and I have been on a mission of research, knowledge and awareness eversince and most importantly to share all I have learned. As we kno.w Fibromyalgia is not a curable disease, however we have learned Fibromyalgia's symptoms can actually be eliminated through using holistic approaches. This is incredible news for all those suffering. I feel as if I have unlocked the gates of heaven, and I would like to share my journey with you. I refuse to allow Fibromyalgia to ruin my life any further. I have read hundreds of books and seen many, many documentaries, read articles and medical journals, gone to seminars, participated in online seminars and informative classes, concerning these illnesses and concerns of Fibromyalgia, Chronic Pain Syndrome, Western Medicine v\/s Eastern Medicine, Holistic Practices of many forms in the help of eliminating and healing the diseases as well as Nutrition and how nutrition factors into your symptoms. I would say after nine years I am extremely knowledgeable within these fields. I am also the creator and administrator of another support group and have many new and exciting groups in the works. Even though Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain Syndromes are not very well known within the public as well as within the medical fields we are learning more and more every day. We would love if you participated in our excitement in all that has been learned. It would be my pleasure in sharing all I know and help you to eliminate your symptoms. Please come and sit back and enjoy our group! The purpose of the group is to offer face to face support, knowledge, years of research, trial and error within eliminating symptoms with success. The group will provide exciting information, learning, sharing, and teaching our loved ones how to deal with our illness and compassion within Chronic Pain and the symptoms of Fibromyalgia. Everyone who has Fibromyalgia should attend this insightful meeting as well as family members, loved ones and care givers. Anyone curious about the disease that may be doing research may also attend. Be well and we hope to see you at the \"Meetup\".<\/p>",

Instructions are designed for both beginners and experienced practitioners.<\/p>\n<p><span><em>Most classes and workshops are free for all participants. Although a donation amount is suggested, donations are not required for participation. The MBSR courses are not free, but some scholarship is available. <br> <\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p>While the forms of meditation we practice are rooted in Buddhist teachings, the study and practice of mindfulness and insight meditation is applicable to anyone from any background or religion, and all are welcome.<\/p>\n<p>We are affiliated with the Insight Meditation Community of Washington (IMCW) and the teaching of Tara Brach, Jonathan Foust and Hugh Byrne.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Each class will include:<\/strong> guided meditation, instruction, opportunities to practice, and time for discussion, questions and answers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When and where:<\/strong> Our ongoing drop-in class meets every Tuesday from 7:30-9:00 p.m. on days the school is open at Centennial High School, 4300 Centennial Lane, Ellicott City, MD, 21042, room 406. Please arrive early to settle into your seats - we start right at 7:30 p.m. If you arrive late, please enter as quietly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Other classes, workshops and courses are provided on an occasional basis. Typically we hold an 8-Week Introduction to Insight Meditation series starting in August, January and April, an 8-Week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course three or four times per year, and a daylong workshop every month or two.&nbsp; To access our schedule, please follow this link:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Columbia-Insight-Meditation-Group\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Columbia-Insight-Medi...<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>We practice Insight Meditation<\/strong>, a style of meditation that helps the mind attain deeper levels of calm concentration through sustained attention on the breath, then combines this with the crucial aspect of insight through contemplation of the mind and body and all of their changing and impermanent senses, emotions and thoughts. Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p>\n<p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What we offer:<\/strong> Our ongoing drop-in Tuesday evening classes generally consist of a half hour semi-guided meditation, followed by a talk on Buddhist principles and their application to daily life, followed by discussion and\/or practice.<\/p>\n<p>We hold our 8-Week Introduction to Insight Meditation Series starting in August, January and May. These classes run from 6:30 to 7:20 p.m. on Tuesday evenings. Those who attend intro classes are encouraged to stay for at least the half-hour meditation that starts at 7:30 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>We offer workshops (typically day long) to help deepen practice. Some of our workshop topics are: Deepening Insight, a Daylong Silent Workshop; Insight Out Loud (working with partners to deepen insight); A Day of Heart Practices; Deepening Presence; and a Relationship Workshop.<\/p>\n<p>Our 8-Wek Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) courses help students initiate and develop an ongoing daily mindfulness meditation practice. These 8-week courses are designed to help students develop strategies to reduce stress and to relate to their day-to-day experiences in a more calm and creative manner.<\/p>\n<p>We also sponsor Kalyani-Mitta (KM) groups. These are groups that meet outside the normal class hours to discuss Buddhist principles more in depth and to share about how these ideas apply to their personal lives. These groups also help foster deeper connection to other members of the community (sangha).<\/p>\n<p><strong><span>Teacher:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>Stan Eisenstein<\/span><\/strong><span>, a high school teacher who has been meditating for over 25 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is not carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p>\n<p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p>\n<p>3. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p>\n<p>4. Please try not to wear any perfume to the class, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p>\n<p>5. The group is not recommended for those under age 13.<\/p>\n<p>6. If you arrive late, please enter the room as quietly as possible.<\/p>",

We invite photographers, artists, and models from all over the world to take advantage of this incredibly unique space! For photographers \/ filmmakers, we offer hourly rates for shooting in the warehouse and we also have membership deals. In addition, we host monthly events for models and photographers! More information about Graffiti Warehouse, our pricing, and membership offers can be found at www.graffitiwarehouse.com For street \/ graffiti artists, we offer XL canvasses and the space to create artwork. All artists must provide their own paint. The canvasses we provide are up to 34 feet long and they are stapled directly onto the wall, instead of mounted on a wooden frame.

We believe that a close neighborhood is a much stronger, safer, and more sustainable neighborhood. When urban residents have friends in the neighborhood, they are much more likely to eat, shop, dance, drink, work &amp; workship locally. Residents who are well connected in their community are also more likely to want to support that community \u2013 whether it's picking up litter in the park, planting trees, or joining the Community Improvement Association. Lastly, residents who build a neighborhood network are much more likely to buy property and become life-long members of the neighborhood.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span>Note:<\/span> <span>The Mount Vernon Urbanites is a membership organization that is completely volunteer run.

We base club operations out of Mill Creek near Annapolis, Maryland. Our primary goal is to build competent crew and skippers of larger sailing boats. We train to U.S. Navy standards as formalized by the U.S. Naval Sailing Association, and issue certificates for classroom courses and sailing instruction on the water. We build experience through day cruises, evening cruises, overnight cruises, member personal cruises, and cruises to shore-side restaurants and other points of interest. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/ansa.org\/membership\/\">ANSA membership<\/a> is open to all. Some of us have no sailing experience, and some have many years at sea. We have social sailors, able bodied crew, senior crew, watch captains, cruising skippers, and senior skippers. We all love to sail, teach, and share our stories. We sail and maintain a 44-foot Caribbean Sailing Yacht called <a href=\"http:\/\/ansa.org\/sv-fantasea\/\">S\/V Fantasea<\/a>, and some of our members own boats as well. If you have your own boat and need experience or some trained crew, come and&nbsp; join ANSA. Talk with our members, train and sail with us. Log some hours and build on your sailing experiences. You will be glad you did!<\/p> \n<p>If you are <a href=\"http:\/\/ansa.org\/join-ansa\/\">interested in sailing<\/a> or want to build on your existing sailing skills, we\u2019d like to welcome you aboard.<\/p>\n<p>Additional information and pictures are at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ansa.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ansa.org<\/a><\/p>",

Join our Jobhunters Support Group on Tuesdays at 1:00 p.m. in the Church Narthex. A free sandwich lunch is provided. Nancy Jeannechild and Rev. Carol Cook started this group for people hunting for work to share jobhunting ideas and tips and to support each other spiritually. Sometimes it helps just to know that other people emphathize with your situation. The Jobhunters Support Group helps to fulfill our church's Action Plan to Enable Service, Foster Fellowship, and Encourage Education. Our group members have expressed gratitude and recommend us to others. If you know of people searching for work, please share this information with them. Questions? Call the Church Office (410-435-1506) or the pastor's cell phone (410-800-3730).<\/p>",

        "description": "<p><span>This is the safer soccer subgroup of the regular <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/dcsoccer\/\">Washington, DC Pick-up Soccer<\/a> group. &nbsp;This subgroup is used to communicate about issues specific to safer soccer. &nbsp;All members subscribed to organizer messages will receive a weekly email from an organizer (usually Jason Taylor) about safer soccer. However, anyone is welcome to view the past three of seven years of emails archived <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/safersoccer\/boards\/thread\/23643732\/140\/\">here<\/a>. &nbsp;For safety, all games in this subgroup use a special full-sized very soft foam ball. We play in Silver Spring, Maryland, north of the beltway by about 5 minutes. We have some slots for more players, so feel free to apply to join us. However, we are very, very picky! &nbsp;Only about ~35% of applicants are accepted! &nbsp;No soccer experience is required, but do not join if you are injured. The ball is slightly harder to dribble in hot weather. So, why do we use it? One reason is to prevent pain, but another reason has to do with the link between non-concussive heading and growth of a protein called tau. Tau probably strengthens brain tissue, which is good, and probably why this occurs, but in doing so there is probably a permanent loss of mental ability. If you'd like to know more about this, you can read here:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><a href=\"http:\/\/healthland.time.com\/2012\/11\/13\/study-soccer-players-without-concussions-still-have-brain-changes\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/healthland.time.com\/2012\/11\/13\/study...<\/a><\/span> <br> <span><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chronic_traumatic_encephalopathy\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chronic_trauma...<\/a><\/span> <br> <span><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tau_protein\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tau_protein<\/a><\/span> <br> <span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SltxL7VbooA\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SltxL7VbooA<\/a> (2 minutes) <br> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/pages\/frontline\/league-of-denial\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/pages\/frontline\/lea...<\/a> minutes 1:24-1:29 (6 minutes) <br> <br> For reasons we can't discuss here, be skeptical of what you read about this topic. For similar reasons, you are either for our group, or you are against our group (and, by default, for the majority\/status quo). <br> <br> To maximize safety and to help the group overall you should (1) upload a picture so we can call you by your name instead of by \"yellow shoes,\" (2) use your real first and last names, (3) rsvp for any games you might want to attend, (4) also rsvp at <a href=\"http:\/\/meetup.com\/dcsoccer\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/meetup.com\/dcsoccer<\/a> (where the safer soccer games are again listed among traditional games), and (5) be worthy of being passed to the entire game. &nbsp;If you want more privacy or can't do those 5 things, that's OK, but it won't be 100% free anymore; before 11am the day of a game you'll need to pay (click \"<a href=\"https:\/\/secure.meetup.com\/safersoccer\/contribute\/\">chip in<\/a>\") $5\/game\/item not completed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><b>Special Rules<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p>We ref throw ins, corner kicks, kick offs, fouls, yellow cards, etc. We do not allow any player to use their hands for strategic purposes (like a goalie), but some <b>handballs may be legal<\/b> and desirable, especially if the intent was to protect your face or body from the ball.<b>&nbsp;\"Intense fouls\", even if \"unintentional\", especially those \"face kicks\" resulting in a player's head getting a non-soft hit by anything award 1\/2 point to the innocent team, even if it was a same-team foul. &nbsp;Note that this yields counter-intuitive play: the fouling (\"guilty\") team kicks off on the kickoff line after such a foul because the \"innocent\" team just scored.<\/b> &nbsp;If you spot a call, like an out of bounds or a foul, calling it also helps the group, and makes it easier for the ref so long as you wait for her to back your initial call.<\/p>\n<p><span>Next point wins: to make the game fun all the way to the end, if one team is \u201csenior\u201d by 2 or more points when there are 10 minutes left, the \u201cnext point wins\u201d rule may begin in which:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul> \n <p><span>If someone scores, their team wins.<\/span><\/p> \n <p><span>If nobody scores, the senior team wins.<\/span><\/p> \n<\/ul>\n<p><span>If you are on the senior team you may wish to play keep away to run out the clock. The captain of the senior team can contest \u201cnext point wins\u201d by trying to pick two coin tosses in a row correctly.

        "description": "<p>The motivation for holding these dialogues is to observe the workings of the self and possible connections to conflict and suffering. We aim to explore together the nature of the self, \"What am I?\", by looking at the operation of the self in our daily lives. We want to use a leaderless dialogue\/inquiry process as a mirror in which we can see our own conditioning and patterns of thought happening in real time. The proposed focus of the dialogue group is not solely on the questions that arise, but also on the thought\/emotion\/relationship process with which the individual and the group engage the questions. In contrast to debate and discussion, dialogue is not a comparison of opinions or an attempt to convince another of a held conviction. The aim is not problem solving or self-improvement, but observation of the self in action. We encourage avoiding quick responses and listening deeply both to the speaker and to one's own reactions, so that our questions and opinions can appear in a new light. We think dialogue can only work in an atmosphere of affection and openness between the participants. . How it works: A quote or video clip relevant to the dialogue\/inquiry into self (from J. Krishnamurti) may be provided as a possible starting point. A period of silence starts the dialogue process. This lasts until someone is moved to start. Then there is a check-in\/go-round, with everybody having the chance to speak to what is happening with themselves, possibly in reaction to what they have heard. Then the dialogue proceeds spontaneously.. If too much of the discussion is going on between a few people, someone can ask for a check in to go around and find out what is going on with those not speaking.<\/p>",

As my friends move to other cities\u00a0or have tighter schedules, I find my time devoted to work, exercise\u00a0and my boyfriend's social circle... and I won't settle for it!\u00a0I want to forge my own friendships in a relaxing environment with girls who have similar interests. I'm looking to create a group of young ladies who live close to home (in or near Silver Spring, MD) and want to find <strong>sincere<\/strong> friendships. If you like to enjoy a glass of wine, new restaurants, a good read, happy hour, arts\/ cultural events, concerts, wine festivals, cooking clubs, laughter with down-to-earth girls, random gatherings after a long day at the office, movie outings, outdoor adventures, themed-nights, making real friends, and more, then welcome! Please don't be shy and jump right in with any suggestions! If there's nothing on the calendar, you have a fun meetup idea, or would like to host an event at your place, let me know... I always appreciate the help :-)<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Please note that all of the introductory questions are MANDATORY, so failure to fill them in or simply saying your name (\"Hi, I'm Lisa\", etc) WILL result in a declined membership. We are only interested in sincere requests and attempts at making friends. Also REQUIRED is your $5 yearly dues, so please give them to me at your first Meetup.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Final note, please be respectful of the other ladies in this group when you RSVP. We prefer intimate gatherings, so if you RSVP to an event, please show up. I will remove membership for ladies who are inactive for 2+ months and those who've had\u00a0numerous no-shows.<\/p>",

Hardware \"minimal viable products (MVPs)\" can be build in weeks or days, and \"pretotypes\" can often be formulated in just hours or even minutes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Identify the right product to build before you mass produce:<\/strong> This classic rule still holds. How can we identify the right hardware product to build without expending too many resources?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unique challenges for hardware:<\/strong> Hardware startups have their own unique logistic challenges- inventory management, component sourcing, and manufacturing to name a few. We will discuss and learn how to handle these issues as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Inventor to entrepreneur:<\/strong> We hardware folks <em>love<\/em> to tinker and invent. This is pure fun! Can we apply this tinkering mindset to build business, not just gizmos?<\/p>\n<p>If your product moves, flies, makes a sound, has blinking lights, or does something physical, come join us!<\/p>",

Our time will be split between exploration and study of the traditional 8-fold path of yoga based on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and the practices on that path, with the focus always on meditation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : justify\"><br>\n\n <span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : medium\">Prayag is a Sanskrit word meaning a confluence or joining of sacred streams or rivers. Each of us is such a sacred stream carrying our own spiritual experience and background. By coming together we create a group energy that is greater than, and transcends, what an individual can achieve. My goal for the Baltimore Prayag Center for Spiritual Growth is to create a kalyana-mitra (spiritual friendship) which provides support to one another along the spiritual path while learning and practicing together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : justify\"><br>\n\n <span style=\"font-size : medium\"><span style=\"color : #000000\">I am a student\/initiate of the Himalayan Yoga Tradition taught by Sri Swami Rama. I have been studying, practicing and teaching for many years. My current teacher in the tradition, Swami Veda Bharati, suggested that I start a group \u201c. . . of like-minded people walking on a pilgrimage in life.\u201d I am happy to share what I have learned over the years, but my hope is that we will also each contribute so that the combined wisdom of the group will guide us along the way.

We\u2019re assuming there are others like us out there and we\u2019d love to meet you! We enjoy one another\u2019s company but it\u2019s always great to have some couple friends to hang out with too. We\u2019ll be planning all kinds of events, some with just a few couples and some with a big group so feel free to jump in wherever you feel comfortable. We\u2019re open to any suggestions for fun meet-ups you might have in mind too. When you join the group please be ready to commit to making your best effort to attend at least one meetup every other month. If you're already committed to a bunch of other meetup groups this may not be the one for you-the goal is to have people get out to the meetups and get to know other couples. &nbsp;Hope to see you at a meet-up soon!<\/p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>SHAKESPEARE LOVERS - Chevy Chase, MD<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\"Shakespeare Lovers\" is dedicated to studying and savoring a single play of Shakespeare's per season, followed by a post-reading DVD Party to wrap up each cycle! The plays are usually chosen based on what is being performed at either the Shakespeare Theatre or the Folger Theatre during a given season. <span>My goal for the group is to ensure<\/span> <span>a focus on Shakespeare's own words - chosen for their poetic beauty, their wisdom, or both - to facilitate our discussions and commentary.<\/span> Via prepared \"handouts\" filled with quotes, we delve into the Bard's profound artistic legacy. Great art is a wonderful way to nurture our inner beings and I hope the group would help facilitate such experiences for you! As organizer, I trained and work in the visual arts (art and architecture), however, having moved to London-UK as a teenager, was also exposed to a healthy dose of great theatre via parents who were keen on instilling culture in their kids from an early age. A love for great literature also happens to define my Persian (Iranian) heritage's national character, with Persian literature having been used as a guide-to-life tool for centuries, and in turn, having made falling for Shakespeare an effortless experience! (I've been dedicated to the bard since seeing Jeremy Irons at the RSC in London in 1987...) Our \"Shakespeare Lovers\" group continues to attract a fascinating mix of people from all walks of life. Feel free to sign up and join our little circle!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A favorite quote from Macbeth: (I love the little warning shot from Banquo) - How we're often tricked and enticed by half-truths, or trivial truths, in order to be won over by a bigger wickedness:<\/p>\n<p><strong><b>\"And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,<\/b><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>The instruments of darkness tell us truths,<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Win us with honest trifles, to betray\u2019s<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>In deepest consequence.\"<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>MACBETH - <i>Banquo<\/i> from Act I sc. iii<\/b><\/p>",

Our sessions are a productive and positive place to share issues and get regular feedback. The ultimate goal is to help each other self-publish our own projects and provide regular opportunities for discussion and collaboration. We have appeared at SPX twice and have brought out 8 books since our inception.<\/p>\n<p>Typically we meet in NW DC, near the Van Ness\/UDC (Red Line) metro stop, but we also road trip to different conventions and comic events up and down the East Coast and beyond.

Join us at a variety of locations around Baltimore as we continue to Explore, Report, and Cooperate across the Inner Sea!<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : medium ; text-decoration : underline\"><strong>About Pathfinder Society Organized Play<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>In an organized play campaign, your character exists in a common setting shared by thousands of other gamers from around the world. In each Pathfinder Society game, your character experiences adventures in two different ways. The first is a short, one-sitting adventure (or \"scenario\") that is a single episode in a continuing story and generally lasts four to five hours. The second is a longer, multi-session adventure (or \"module\") that is a single adventure but can take anywhere from eight to twelve hours to play.<\/p>\n<p>You can take your character to any public Pathfinder Society event anywhere in the world, and while the Game Master and your companions might change every time you play, your character advances as normal. Over time, campaigning in an organized play environment offers a uniquely immersive experience, as your diverse companions add depth and character to the campaign world. It's also a great way to get in touch with other local gamers, meet new people, and play regularly without all the prep work and scheduling of a traditional campaign. Your local regional coordinator (also called a Venture-Captain or Venture-Lieutenant) can assist you in finding or setting up your own Pathfinder Society event.<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, some players prefer to keep their Pathfinder Society experience limited to a familiar group of friends, using the Pathfinder Society character creation rules, adventure scenarios, and reward structure as the framework for a private campaign. Either approach is a valid way to experience the campaign, and many players enjoy a combination of public and private adventuring.<\/p>\n<p>Because Organized Play takes place in a shared-world environment, additional rules are required to ensure that all players at all tables share a similar experience, no matter who is running the game. The\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/paizo.com\/products\/btpy84k4\">Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play<\/a> outlines these special rules, ensuring a level playing field for all. Please read over the contents of this guide carefully.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : medium ; text-decoration : underline\"><strong>How do I get started?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>All Pathfinder Society players must register themselves and their characters online. When you register on the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderSociety\/myAccount\">My Pathfinder Society<\/a> page, you'll receive an official Pathfinder Society Number. Keep your Pathfinder Society Number handy and bring it with you to every Pathfinder Society event you attend. Paizo uses this number to record the adventures your character has completed and the prestige she has gained. Each character you create has a unique number appended to your Pathfinder Society Number, so if your number is 10222, the second character you create will be 10222\u20132.<\/p>\n<p>If you don't have time to create a new character or simply wish to try out a new character class, you may choose to use one of several\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderSociety\/playerResources\">level-appropriate pregenerated characters available<\/a> or from your local event coordinator. If you play a 1st-level pregenerated character, you can apply the credit for her first adventure to a newly created character of your very own.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><strong><span style=\"font-size : medium\">Where can I play?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Once you've got a Pathfinder Society Number and have created your character, you're ready to play your first Pathfinder Society scenario or module! The easiest way to find a local game is to join this Meetup and RSVP for one of the upcoming Meetups on this site with an advertised level range for a level 1 character<\/span><span>. The level range will be listed at the end of the Meetup title in parenthesis such as (1-2),(1-5) or (1-7).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><strong><span style=\"font-size : medium\">What do I have to bring?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>At a minimum you'll need a character sheet with all of your character information and details as well as an inventory tracking sheet which you can<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/paizo.com\/download\/pathfinder\/PZOPSS0000E-Sheets.zip\">Download Here<\/a><span>. You'll also need to bring a copy of your Pathfinder Society Number (it's a good idea to write it somewhere on your character sheet), a set of 7 polyhedral dice, a pencil, a 1-inch scale miniature or token to represent your character on a combat grid, and a copy of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook. Other players may be able to lend you dice or a miniature for the gaming session if you don't have any, but eventually you'll want to get a set of your own. The only thing left needed is a desire to roleplay and have have fun!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I hope to see you at the gaming table soon,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Venture Captain Matt Hudson<br>\n\n Baltimore, MD Lodge<\/span><\/p>",

While dating is encouraged, it is not necessarily an inter-racial dating group \u2013 its broader purpose is to provide social venues for fun people to hang out and have FUN! While we love our own races, one of the group\u2019s purposes is to give women and men more opportunity to meet others of diverse backgrounds, whether it is a new or common experience. To join, you must be single or in an interracial relationship. Players, swingers or pick-up artist are not welcomed We will visit some of the most interesting venues throughout Maryland, DC, VA and even internationally and domestically. If you are into Jazz, visiting museums\/art galleries, dancing, live music, happy hour meet and greets, traveling, volunteering, health &amp;amp; fitness, sporting events and simply enjoying the moment, then we'd love to see you at our next meet-up. We look forward to meeting you! Please Note: 1. A photo is mandatory to join this group, a individual clear picture of your face is required. 2. You can be a male or female of any race. *Interracial couples are welcomed to join (your picture must be of you and your mate and your intro must note that you are in a relationship)<\/p>",

This is a structured networking event. Nothing to sell, no sales pitches, no books, no boot camps, no DVDs, no class time.\u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n We will spend some time learning about private investment dollars, retirement plan dollars and how to find those sources.I regularly hear from investors that they want to meet other people who have similar goals and interests. At any event I attend, participants always request more networking time. So, here it is. All networking and no distractions.<\/p>\n<p><span>It has been said many times that your net worth is a reflection of your network. By coming to this meetup, you'll learn how others network and how to improve your own. Here are a few suggestions to help create a successful Meetup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>1. Come prepared, have business cards, bring something to take notes with and rehearse your introduction.<br>\n\n 2. Know how you can help others and how they can help you.<br>\n\n 3. This time is not about selling deals. It is about meeting people and creating opportunities during your followup with a new connection you make at the event.<br>\n\n 4. Have a followup plan in place.<br>\n\n 5. Invite someone already in your network - be a go giver to become a go getter.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<iframe src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Wr1Wonu-DnU\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" style=\"margin : 5px ; max-width : 700px ; max-height : 700px\"><\/iframe>",

So this is a mix of outdoor activities and social events-no dinner and movies for us on a regular basis. \u00a0So check out our calendar. We also want to hear from the members about fun venues you have been to or would like to try. This is about getting out, making friends and having new experiences-maybe checking some of those items off your Bucket List-but most of all it's about having FUN!!! our group is open to all...single, married, divorced, separated, new to the area...as long as you want to be active, upbeat and young-minded,So if you want to have fun with a truly great group of people, join us and start enjoying yourself<\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span>You must post a recognizable head shot for your main profile picture.We need to be able to pick you out of a crowd from your picture on an RSVP list, which are small. No sunglasses or distance pictures.So, unless you're Mother Nature, a scenic view will not work. thanks<\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span>We appreciate a level of manners and responsibility. No-shows can and will happen, we understand....<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We do ask that when you come to your first meetup w\/this group that you donate a $5.00 annual fee to the organizer in charge. This fee is given to the main organizer for the fees she is responsible for\u00a0in Meetup.com.<\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span>We do not need you to RSVP \"No\" to events you don't plan to attend. We assume you aren't attending unless you tell us that you are. But if you say you are coming, or please change your RSVP to reflect that your plans have changed and you won't be joining us. What has worked in the past, Is a simple text message, to the host member. we will offer text numbers, to the member<\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span>Also, we are a fun group and appreciate an upbeat attitude. Considering the number of activities and participants, we have virtually no major issues with any of our events. occasionally things don't go exactly as planned, but we still always have a great time, and everything works out. Remember that the organizers are VOLUNTEERS and work very hard to plan and carry out activities for a numbers of people. So if you can be of help in any way, please step up and volunteer-even in small ways.<\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span>We look forward to meeting you and hope you have a lot of fun with our group.<\/span><\/p>",

You are not here by accident, but have arrived to deepen your relationship with God, study His Word to gain understanding, and apply Biblical applications to your real life issues - the topics not regularly discussed or avoided in church and more traditional Bible studies.<\/p>\n<p>This is a Non-Denomenational Women's Bible Study for women facing real life issues and will use Biblical applications to live a life of prosperity, victory and success. All are welcome - those who have participated in Women's Bible Study and those whom have never participated - come so we can all learn and grow in God's Word together. If you have ever wanted to learn more about God's Word and be in an informal, non-traditional learning environment, with other women who are seeking understanding with frank, open discussions about any and all issues that impact women, their families and society, then this is the place for you! We will have speakers, attend retreats, social events, discuss book club selections that deal with real life issues - (Christian and secular books and various genres - fiction, non-fiction, biographies, autobiographies and whatever else we select), and of course fellowship at restaurants. This is a fun, thought provoking, and empowering group.<\/p>\n<p>We will meet each week to discuss and learn about different books of the Bible, and then open the study to discuss the following topics: marriage, divorce, mental illness, death, infidelity, single parenthood, motherhood, addiction, abortion, homosexuality, economic hardship, prayer, faith, spiritual warfare, the myth of superwoman, menopause, sexuality and many more topics.<\/p>\n<p>Join us if you dare to become the Mighty Woman of God you were and are destined to be! It's time to do the work, study and live the life God intended for you! I will give you location and times upon membership. Be blessed!<\/p>\n<p>**Also, upon membership, be sure to join in the weekly discussions on the Message Board - select discussions from selection menu at top of page.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Do you love brunch (and other meals) but hate getting up early in the morning? Do you want to meet new people and expand your social circle, while eating the best meal of the day? If so, this group is for you!<\/p>\n<blockquote> \n <p><span><strong>Membership Dues<\/strong><\/span><\/p> \n<\/blockquote>\n<p>There is an annual membership fee of $4. We use the fee to pay Meetup's hosting cost (180$ annually), since we have no other overhead it ensures the member fee is kept low.&nbsp;<span>When you are first approved for the group, you get a 30 day grace period during which you can attend brunches without paying the fee. Note that outside the 30 day free exemption, you must pay and be in good standing to attend. If after 30 days you choose not to pay dues, you will be removed from the group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you aren't able to attend a brunch during your month, send a message to me (Forrest) and I'll give you an extension.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote> \n <p><strong>Guidelines for Brunch Attendance<\/strong><\/p> \n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Since most of our events involve reservations, please do your best to attend when you RSVP. Our policy is as follows:<\/p>\n<p>-You can change\/cancel your RSVP for any reason up to 24 hours before any event.<\/p>\n<p>-If you must cancel within 24 hours, please contact the organizer directly and explain what came up. This may allow for the reservation to be changed etc. Not contacting the organizer within 24 hours is grounds for possible expulsion.<\/p>\n<p>-No shows are automatically expelled from the group. If something terrible came up and you weren't able to or didn't have time to contact the organizer, get in touch and we'll let you back in.<\/p>\n<p>As a rule we don't allow +1s since we charge a small fee for membership. If you want to bring someone to an event who is not a member of the group, contact the organizer. While we're generally happy to welcome folks on a one-time basis, if they want to come regularly they must join the group and pay the fee.<\/p>\n<p>Organizers decide on an individual basis which kind of waitlist to use. If the event is under an automatic waitlist (i.e. people from the list are automatically signed up when someone drops out) please be aware that you may be RSVPed for the event at any time and the usual attendance rules will apply. If you're on one of these waitlists and know you can't make it, please take yourself off.<\/p>\n<p><span>Although it is often possible to split checks, please consult the event page as some places do not divide bills for larger groups, a few only accept cash, and finally some will only take a certain number of cards per group. In these cases please bring enough cash to pay for what you order. Unless otherwise stated, it should be possible to pay however you like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Since our events tend to be limited in size, they often fill up quite quickly. We encourage anyone who wants to go to get on the waitlist, since many people will change their minds prior to the event. As well, we know to go more often with larger groups to places where many people want to come!<\/p>\n<p>Do your best to arrive near the scheduled start time of the event, keep in mind the parking conditions in the area the event is being held and\/or any metro closures. Some places are very strict when it comes to seating groups prior to the arrival of the whole party, and it's generally problematic to have to wait a long time to order etc. so it's not nice to be late. Generally speaking, we try to order within 15-20 minutes of the posted event time even if some folks haven't arrived. Frequent excessive lateness may be grounds for expulsion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote> \n <p><strong>Other Group Info<\/strong><\/p> \n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span>Exercise common courtesy<\/span><span> when attending brunches, we reserve the right to expel anyone for rude or disrespectful behavior at events.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Organizers reserve the right to change or cancel events. Please read any correspondence from us if you've RSVPed to something.<\/p>\n<p>If you are interested in being an event organizer, please let me know; the more organizers we have, the more brunches we can have! It's a really fun and easy way to eat more brunches and meet more fun people!<\/p>",

Let's revisit old favorites like _A Wrinkle in Time_ and the _Half Magic_ series, as well as new classics like _When You Reach Me_, _Will Grayson, Will Grayson_, and _Marcello in the Real World_. We can also consider questions where we benefit from adulthood\/hindsight, such as... Do you like _The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe_ any better or worse now that you know it's all Christian allegory? How in the world did Orson Scott Card predict the entire Internet and blogosphere in _Ender's Game_? I'm hoping to get together once a month (or maybe six weeks or two months... we're all busy) in coffee shops in the Mt Washinton\/Hampden\/Charles Village\/Mt Vernon areas with a book to discuss and some sweet treats to eat. Weekend afternoons are usually best.",

        "description": "<p>The concept behind this Meetup is not a new one; artists have always collaborated with one another to stoke their creative fires by reacting artistically to each others work. In this case, the idea is for each artist to bring a sketchbook, begin a drawing, then have that sketchbook rotated through everyone else at the table, allowing the other artists to add to, and finish the drawing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You don't have to be a good artist to participate<\/strong>; the end result will be interesting no matter what, and even a \"bad drawing\" can inspire creativity in others.<\/p>\n<p>This is an exercise in creative action &amp; productivity, not necessarily contemplation; therefore I thought it would be necessary to implement a time-limit--but since a timer doesn't really feel very natural in a creative environment, we'll use a 'musical chairs' system, and rotate after each song ends. A non-drawing participant will play DJ (or we will meet at a venue with music on the sound system) and indicate when it is time to switch sketchbooks.<\/p>\n<p>I thought it would make sense to mix-up the time-limits, so that artists would have enough time to properly begin a drawing, but also be regulated by time later on to encourage speed and action in their work. So the person to start a drawing would have perhaps 4 songs (about 16 minutes) to start a drawing, then the next would have 3, the next 2. Once the drawings are being rotated every single song, they would continue at this rate until the sketchbook arrives at it's original owner. A single session would last around 45 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>At this point we would take a break and share the work with the group, and perhaps scan them in for posting in the Meetup gallery. Then, for those interested, we can continue to do additional sessions until everyone gives up and goes home.<\/p>\n<p>Any dry, clean medium (pen, pencil, crayon) is acceptable; please <strong>do not use<\/strong> wet mediums (paint, glue, watercolors) or anything that is exceptionally messy (charcoal), because some people might not want to carry their sketchbook home with stuff dripping or falling out of it.<\/p>\n<p>Even with this in mind, please remember that you are bringing your own sketchbook for possible strangers to draw in; so make sure you start your drawing on a page where the drawing behind it on the next page won't be damaged by, for example, markers that bleed through or the indentations of harshly applied pencils.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Some additional rules to consider:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>You may only erase pencil work by another artist for the purpose of integrating it with new artwork (e.g., if the new art overlaps a portion of the old art).<\/li>\n<li>Do not completely erase or otherwise cover any other artwork from previous turns (this includes anyone else's artwork, but also your own from previous turns)<\/li>\n<li>If you work in pencil, be aware of rule #1<\/li>\n<li>Anyone may color anyone else's uncolored artwork<\/li>\n<li>Anyone may ink in anyone else's pencil artwork<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>By the way...<\/strong> It costs $15 a month to run this Meetup page, so if you don't mind making some contribution (you can just buy me a couple beers) it would be appreciated!<\/p>",

Our members are at all levels of the dance ability spectrum, from beginner to advanced. We've got a solid demographic mix. Though our present membership has a preference for country music, we play from other genres too, including hip-hop, pop, and Latin. Some events are free, and for others we charge only a nominal fee (just to cover expenses). While some of us are very serious about dance, many come just for an evening out, for a little bit of exercise, to socialize, and to have fun in a safe and friendly environment. \u00a0All are welcome!<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Karma Clearing is one of the most important things you can do to raise your Light and Vibration levels, further your Spiritual walk, and make your life easier. Karma will interfere with relationships, (Love, family, friends and business), advancement in work and monetary issues, to name a few areas.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n In our Karmic Clearing classes you will effectively clear your Karmic debt with the souls that are incarnate with you in this lifetime, (Your Soul Group), as well as any karmic debt brought forward into this lifetime from past lifetimes with these souls, and further Karmic Debt accrued currently in this life with them. We have also been successful in clearing Karmic debt that seems to cause allergies, phobias and other situations.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n In Other Words: All Karmic debt, incurred in the NOW and Karmic debt brought forward from past lives with\/from another individual, is released with that individual you are working on, who is currently in your life.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Our classes are designed to be extremely effective for the advanced soul, one that is well along their Spiritual walk, Lightworker, Healer,(in all modalities), as well as the beginner who has just realized an awakening to their Spirituality. Each person in class is working on themselves only and is able to go at the pace THEY need for Karmic Debt release.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Classes are held in a safe and comforting space, as are the spiritually mature people who facilitate these classes. Rev LizAnn facilitates the sessions, with help from Nancee, Rev Barbara and Cliff. We all have experience with communication to the Divine level of Masters and the Angelic Realm, and know how to control and guide so your experiences will be good. Rev LizAnn was directed by Divine Masters and Karmic Lords to make these classes available here in the Metro DC area.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n It has been suggested by The Masters that a minimum of 4 class sessions should be undertaken. This will clear Karma between you and 32 or more Souls in your life that have affected Karmic Debt on you. Each class clears Karma from 8 to 15 people in your life; you will feel the ripple effect from this and the people you clear will also experience some healing from your work.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Classes run 7 to 9:30PM, Mondays in Rockville, Wednesdays in Silver Spring. You may attend either location as is convenient for you each week, but you must sign onto the proper sign up on Meet Up.\u00a0 There is plentiful, safe parking available at both locations. These classes are on-going; we started in Aug 2011 and have run continuously.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n One class is $25. A series of 4- 2 \u00bd hour classes is $80 ($20 per class). Please speak to me if you will be missing a class out of a session. We accept cash, credit card, Paypal, check.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n If you have further questions, please call Rev. LizAnn, 301-825-5724, or email at <a href=\"mailto:LizAnn@celticflame.org\">LizAnn@celticflame.org<\/a><br>\n\n<br>\n\n I look forward to working with you on this. Blessings, Light and Love to you.<\/p>",

Please do not RSVP \"No\" in advance to every event listed on the entire calendar you already know you can't attend.)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>2) If you do not show up to an event without giving 24 hours notice, you will be counted as a \"No Show.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>3) People who \"No Show\" 3 times, will be put on restriction and will not be able to RSVP or attend events for 3 months. The Event Organizers definitely understand that situations can come up at the last minute that you can't always control, which is why we give you 3.<\/em> <br> <br> <em>4) \"No shows\" will eventually be removed from members account, based on your attendance at other events.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>5) To cover the cost the organizers pay Meetup.com to run the group, we ask for members to contribute $2.50 in yearly dues. Please pay your dues within 3 weeks&nbsp;of joining (and then by Oct 1 each year after), or you will be removed from group events (especially those where paid members are on the wait list) until you pay. The link to pay is on the left side of the page.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Note: You might also be able to arrange to buy me a beer at one of our events in exchange for dues. Just arrange this in advanced so you aren't removed from an event and so I don't have 5 people offering me a beer at one event. ;)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>6) A clear picture of your face is required to join the group, so we can recognize you at events.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>These policies have been put into place to encourage respectfulness and active participation in the group.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you for your attention to these policies! :)<\/em><\/p>",

Palyul is one of the six great \"mother monasteries\" following the Nyingma School, or Ancient Translation Tradition, of Tibetan Buddhism. The monastery was founded in 1665 in the Kham province of eastern Tibet (present-day Baiyu, Sichuan, China) by Kunzang Sherab, the First Palyul Throne Holder.<\/p>\n<p>The purpose of this study group is to offer regular meditation opportunities along with classes lead by Palyul Khenpos (Professors) or senior students. Classes are taken from the Palyul Shedra (University) as well as material compiled from the International Buddhist College (such as our Buddhism 101 class).<\/p>\n<p>Meditation sessions include traditional sitting\/walking meditation as well as sessions for Palyul students working on specific practices (such as Ngondro). Regular celebration practices will also be conducted, such as feast offering practices and holiday practices. All of this means there will be opportunities for people who are interested in simply meditating as well as practice opportunities for people who wish to take their meditation practice to the next level!<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/0\/4\/event_181982052.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; display : block ; margin : 0px auto\"><\/p>",

If you find yourself constantly pulled back into reading about this stuff (Tesla, Bedini, Bearden, Newman, etc) - let's get together. We could coordinate what we read and learn about with an eye on building some of these things. I would like to find where member interest lies and what skills we have. I am a test engineer with some hobby CNC experience and some of these builds are well within our capabilities. I believe it would be a much more efficient use of our time to work together instead of independently. Join up and we'll see when we can get started.",

Our vision is that every mother of preschooler is so impacted by her MOPS experience that she carries it with her for life, making her a better mom who creates a better world. Our MOPS group is a community that strives to meet the needs of every mom with children from birth through kindergarten. MOPS recognizes that urban, suburban, and rural moms, stay-at-home and working moms, teen, single, and married moms all share a similar desire to be the very best moms they can be. MOPS helps moms through relationships established in the context of local groups that provide a caring atmosphere for today's mother of young children<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Have you ever found yourself on a walk in the forest and suddenly come to a place that immediately felt special? Maybe there was some uniquely shaped rock or a tree that attracted your attention? Perhaps you thought for a moment that you could detect something, as if there was some kind of presence on the particular site that you could not really explain? Many people testify that they feel a strong affinity with nature all around us, that their strongest spiritual experiences are when they are moving through the forest.<\/p>\n<p>This is not new of course. Humans have always had similar experiences since the origin of our species long, long ago. Through the ages, we have tried to understand and process these experiences, tried to portray them and give them shape, sought contact with the powers and the presence that we felt all around us. These experiences are the core of nature's religion.<\/p>\n<p>Those of us who closely identify with these experiences exert a natural spirituality and seek a community that share in these gifts. That is the foundation of our community. We seek a harmony with nature and the gods based on ancient traditions and practices. We use the term \"ancient\" but that does not mean that our religion is obsolete or outdated. We reaffirm the old traditions and ways developed by the people who have gone before us, but develop them simultaneously, adapting them to our time and in the modern conditions under which we live. When we use the word \"ancient\", we may also allude to that it is rooted in a mythical time when our ancient ancestors lived in true harmony with the earth.<\/p>\n<p>Our religion is polytheistic, meaning that we recognize and turn to a variety of gods and powers. Among these gods and goddesses include Odin, Freya, Thor, Sif and the others from the Norse mythology. Not all gods are Aesir - Freya is of the Vanir family, moreover, it is not just the gods and goddesses we turn but to nature spirits as the fey, animal totems, and so on. While we share a common religious foundation with the \"Asatru\", we understand that that this term is too narrow.<\/p>\n<p>We recognize and celebrate these powers in rituals that we call blot. The blot can be considered as a symbolic celebration where we invite gods, goddesses and beings to participate, we offer them gifts and forming a relationship with them. A blot can be very simple and intimate but it can also be a big ceremony with many participants. Our festivals are tied to the seasons, and we are also ceremonies surrounding life's rites of passage such as weddings, funerals, naming of children, house blessings, and much more.<\/p>",

It changes negative energy into positive energy, darkness into light and erases the resultant \"bad karma\". It is a unique spiritual energy that can help you in all areas of your life. It can heal emotional and physical problems, improve your relationships and finances, help you to grow spiritually, or just make life easier. As my mentor used to say, it \"clears the trauma without the drama\".&nbsp; Decrees are spoken prayer and declaration of our intents for healing.&nbsp; It calls in the power of the Violet Flame.<\/p>",

I'm 39 years old and if you're like me, it's hard to get out and meet other people with a busy schedule and commitments to family. I LOVE board games, card games, and all kinds of games. I wanted to create a group where we could all meet at least once per month and play a variety of different games out on the market!! There are so many fun and crazy games out there, but I simply don't know enough people nor have enough friends to play...so, this is where this group comes in!! I'm very open to ideas and molding this group to suit the needs of all it's members. I have a 9 year old daughter and am open to all kinds of people, including those with kids, without kids, with or without partners, and all ages as well. All you need is a LOVE of games. I hope that we will all share in hosting a game night and as our group continues to grow, we will make lots of new friends in the process!!<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>\"Life is a board game and you hold the dice in your hand, controlling the next move. You decide where you go with your life. Wherever you may end up, may the odds be forever in your favor.\" - some wise person. &nbsp;:)<\/p>",

I was not sure why but observe she needed additional care - that began my journey as the primary caregiver of my now 86 year old mother with Parkinson and Memory challenges. Had I known of a network of other CGers - I believe I could have accomplished so much more for her. So, out of a need to have us all share and part take of \"CGers\" best practices - this meetup was formed. Taken from the phase - I am having a senior moment - I came up with - I am having a CareGivers Moment. Join, Share, Heal and most importantly provide the best quality of life to the person your are caregiving.<\/p>",

Network with like-minded entrepreneurs who are reinventing themselves or have left the 9-to-5 behind or maybe like in my case the 9-to-5 laid me off. What is your Plan B? Join us to reinvent yourself and become your own boss, start working on your Plan B or to network with other online sellers.<\/p>\n<p>My name is Imogene Armstrong and I was an IT professional for over 30 years. I worked 23 years at my last job before I was laid-off in 2009. I am glad I had a Plan B; I have been selling on eBay since 1999. I am a Top Rated Seller, Powerseller and an eBay Education Specialist trained by eBay. I also have been selling on Amazon since 2007.<\/p>\n<p>If you are interested in learning how to sell on eBay, please check the eBay Education Specialist website for my class dates and times, or email me to schedule a class. I teach mostly one-on-one with an occasional group class. The class includes everything you need to know to begin selling successfully on eBay. I also do a \u201cShop with Jean\u201d workshop where we spend time at a thrift store or estate sale and I show you what sells well on eBay or Amazon. I go over my thrifting routine and the tools I use when thrift shopping. We\u2019ll spend 1-2 hours at the thrift store\/estate sale and then go to a coffee shop to discuss the items purchased and other hot items to look for. I can show you how to turn $20 into $100 and sometimes more. There is no guarantee but, I do it over and over again. My last 6 items on eBay sold for over $140, and I paid approximately $12.75. It does not take a lot of money to start an eBay business.<\/p>",

I started this group to meet more people who have Gastroparesis, or unexplained digestive issues, to have the opportunity to discuss what we are going through and support one another through good and bad days. I am starting support groups in other areas as well, so that there are a few places to choose from. While Bill HR2239 did not get voted on Nov, 2012, we will continue to find every way possible to get set in place the important protocols. Lets get support going for so many who are living with digestive issues that are not explained or misdiagnosed, which may be symptoms of Gastroparesis. Digestive pain, GERD\/Reflux, problems swallowing, feeling full early and pain associated with eating food, diarrhea, constipation, and many more symptoms. Feel free to attend, even if you are not sure if this sounds like you. The more information you know, the better prepared you are when seeing physicians, or when seeking medical support.<\/p>",
