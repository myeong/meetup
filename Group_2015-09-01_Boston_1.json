Since this group was formed early last summer we've done a little bit of everything: going out to dinners, grabbing drinks, visiting museums, brewery tours, ice skating, going to comedy shows, bowling, and exploring specific areas of the city.<\/p>\n<p>Our crowd is usually half regulars, half newcomers so don't be shy if you've never done meetup before! Organizers make sure there are always a lot of fun events planned. Members can also create and organize events, or they can suggest ideas to the organizers (note: We don't allow our group to be used simply as a platform for fundraisers. If any of our regular members is involved in a fundraiser, we're happy to support them, but please do not join our group for this purpose alone)<\/p>\n<p>Answers to some FAQs about the group:<\/p>\n<p>-The target age for the group is roughly 22 to 36. No one will check your age of course but if you're way out of this range it'll be a little obvious :) We'd really like to keep the group at least in the 20s and 30s.<\/p>\n<p>-Member Photos: It is required that all members have a satisfactory photo that we can use to identify members at events. This helps us a great deal as well as aids other members in recognizing you. Please make sure your photo is of YOU and not a pet\/landscape\/cartoon, as it'll be easier for us to spot you at events<\/p>\n<p>-It doesn't cost any money to be a member! Many of the events cost money (food, drinks, admission, etc.) which is why you can pick and choose which ones you attend. Some of our events are spendy, and some are free! Keep in mind that the organizers do have to pay dues to run this group. If you have a good time and can donate a buck or two, please do. It goes a long way to help cover the costs of running the meetup.<\/p>\n<p>-If you've RSVP'd \"Yes\" to an event but decide not to go, please change your RSVP to \"No\" as soon as you can. Organizers plan around the number they're expecting and it's respectful not to make them wait for people who aren't coming.<\/p>\n<p>Any other questions?

I am Organizer of 2 other Monopoly Meetup Groups, The New York City Monopoly Meetup Group and The DC Maryland Virginia Metro Area Monopoly Meetup Group. I have been playing Monopoly since I was a child and started collecting Monopoly Games in the 1980's. I currently have over\u00a0300 different sets from all over the world (different countries, different cities, themed editions, you name it). My goal is to share my love of this great game with others. I often bring different versions to the meetups to play. Most countries and cities have localized the properties. And I think it much more fun if you can buy Mayfair or Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es instead of always buying Boardwalk. If you've ever played Monopoly or would like to learn how to play, come join us. All skill levels are welcome! You don't have to be a pro to enjoy Monopoly. In whatever language, Monopoly still spells FUN! We are a friendly, fun loving group of people that enjoy playing this wonderful board game. So, come and play with us and have fun too! Check out some of the Monopoly Games from around the world in the Photo section.<\/p>\n<p>Steve A.<\/p>\n<p>Group Organizer<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>P.S. - Check out my friend Albert Veldhuis' Monopoly website. He catalogs every Monopoly and Monopoly-like game he can find and lists them all by country.

He travels with his wife to Nairobi, Kenya to bring back art from local artists to sell here in the States. He sells a Kenyan Monopoly Game called Kumiliki. It's a beautiful game that comes in both a standard version with plastic houses and game pieces and a premium version with houses and game pieces made out of soapstone. It looks just like Monopoly but with a beautiful board and box (see photos in the photo section). If anyone is interested in buying this game or any of the Artwork he sells you can contact him through his website.\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.insideafricanart.com\/\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.insideafricanart.com\/\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.insideafricanart.com\/\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.insideafricanart.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.insideafricanart.com\/<\/a><\/p>","lon":-71.0599975586,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/8\/8\/0\/highres_53687232.jpeg","photo_id":53687232,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/8\/8\/0\/600_53687232.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/8\/8\/0\/thumb_53687232.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7238525,"name":"Marty"},"members":62,"name":"The Boston Monopoly Meetup Group","id":2441542,"state":"MA","urlname":"BostonMonopolyMeetup","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Monopoly Players"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Framingham","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1315344720000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"dogtraining","name":"Dog Training","id":10024},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"dogs","name":"Dogs","id":15067},{"urlkey":"readers","name":"Readers","id":17219},{"urlkey":"train-your-dog-by-thinking-dog","name":"Train Your Dog By Thinking Dog","id":49128},{"urlkey":"book-club-non-fiction","name":"Book Club: Non-Fiction","id":51873},{"urlkey":"learn-to-better-understand-your-dogs-point-of-view","name":"Learn to Better Understand your Dogs Point of View","id":111360},{"urlkey":"understanding-dogs","name":"understanding dogs","id":414532},{"urlkey":"dog-book-club","name":"dog book club","id":415462}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SweetWagDogTraining\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Monthly events to help you continue to develop your relationship with your dog.\u00a0Join us for\u00a0\"Meet the Trainer\" nights, The Sweet Wag Dog-Eared Book Club, Dog Talk!

It is simultaneously challenging and safe. No previous movement or music experience is necessary, and no drums are required. Participants come from a diverse array of backgrounds, ages, and interests. The Taketina rhythm process has the ability to repattern deep neurological structures which can have an impact on such diverse aspects of human functioning as emotional balance, pain control, and cognitive learning. Rather than &ldquo;thinking about rhythm&rdquo;, in Taketina, you connect directly to the rhythm using your body. Through vocalization, clapping and stepping you are guided into three separate rhythmic layers. It is a musical group process that allows participants to access their innate ability to express and embody rhythm. Taketina reinforces a natural, at your own pace and organic way of learning that can induce a deeply relaxed state. It is a powerful process that can rapidly quiet the chatter in your head and bring you into connection with your inner core. Are you curious?

We try to come up with interesting places to introduce the members to and some are quite a drive for us. When we go through all this planning and are expecting 5-10 members to arrive and no one does, it shows a massive lack of respect for us and the work we put into planning the event. Some groups charge for each event to limit no shows but we don't. We're not trying to make a living from these events but we deserve respect. <b>If you change your rsvp from yes to no you will not be marked as a no show.<\/b> Your organizers realize life happens but just as you'd tell your boss or a friend that you won't be there, please take a few minutes to change your rsvp. Three no shows will get you removed from the group. Please understand that these rules are as a direct result of 95% of our events having a 20% - 50% no show rate, with a few having a 100% no show.&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-71.2799987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/f\/c\/4\/highres_264188132.jpeg","photo_id":264188132,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/f\/c\/4\/600_264188132.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/f\/c\/4\/thumb_264188132.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":107621302,"name":"Katherine Reem"},"members":195,"name":"New England Photographers Group","id":2952852,"state":"MA","urlname":"NewEnglandPhotographersGroup","category":{"name":"photography","id":27,"shortname":"photography"},"lat":42.4900016785,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1324179538000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"happiness","name":"Happiness","id":16481},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"breathing-meditation","name":"Breathing Meditation","id":19570},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"transformation","name":"Transformation","id":21591},{"urlkey":"world-peace","name":"World Peace","id":23843},{"urlkey":"nature","name":"Nature","id":197471}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CambridgeYoga\/","rating":4.9,"description":"<p>This human being is a guest house, <br>Every morning a new arrival. <br>A joy, a depression, a meanness, <br>Some momentary awareness comes <br>As an unexpected visitor. <br>Welcome and entertain them all, <br>Even if they are a crowd of sorrows <br>Who violently sweep your house <br>Of all it\u2019s furniture. <br>Still treat each guest honorably. <br>She may be cleaning you out for some new delight. <br>The dark thought, the shame, the malice, <br>Meet them at the door laughing, And invite them in. <br>Be grateful for whoever comes, <br>Because each has been sent <br>As a guide from beyond. <br>~Rumi<\/p>\n<p>\"Asana practice is a process for being present in the moment with an abiding sense of freedom and wholeness that brings about an experience of being fully alive, energized, and in bliss.

Learn to live your life by the principles of Tantra Yoga. At each moment you can experience love and oneness with all things. Tantra is a lifestyle. You can call it a mindfulness practice or you can call it the practice of bringing the Divine into everyday experiences from the most mundane moments to the peaks of ecstasy, the path of Tantra allows you to bring body, mind and spirit into balance.<\/p>\n<p>Have you ever wondered if there must be more to sexual loving? Have you experienced the kind of deep sexual connection with a partner that leads you to tears of joy and a deep sense of knowing the divine? Join this meet-up and learn that sex is an art form that every conscious person can master. Learn that when passion, love and consciousness join together they transform sex into a profound and loving meditation that increases intimacy, joy and connection.<\/p>\n<p>If you ever heard the word Tantra and wondered what all the fuss was about - then this is the meet-up for you. Come be informed and guided by three extremely experienced and knowledgeable teachers\/healers, trained among others at the Source School of Tantra Yoga in Santa Cruz, CA, and participate in the inquiry of how to live life to its fullest. Say \"Yes, I want to live my life with passion and awareness!\" Studying Tantra will fulfill this promise by giving you priceless skills - not only in your intimate relationships but woven into all aspects of your life. Let's be students together! (<strong>The word student comes from the Latin word studere which means to devote oneself.<\/strong>)<\/p>\n<p>Although there has been a recent explosion of information on how to be more respectful and accepting of sexuality we can still struggle with the old cultural mixed messages that we carry within ourselves. In a safe and light-hearted environment we will explore these and continue to find ways to shed the old and bring in the new which is actually rooted in a deep knowing since the beginning of human consciousness.<\/p>\n<p>This meet-up group is geared towards beginners, but participants of all levels are welcome. It is our experience that each time, no matter how often one has heard something, a new light is shone on an aspect that one thought (s)he had mastered. If you are a therapist\/healer this meet-up group will also teach you practical tools that you can pass on to the people you work with. Together we will explore the basics of Tantra and move more deeply into the skills for deepening intimacy with yourself and\/or a partner through meditation techniques, understanding and mastering energy, conscious communication, modalities of touch, and so much more. Classes will be a mix of didactic and experiential. We will have exercises, discussions, time for questions and answers, and sacred rituals (pujas).<\/p>\n<p>We meet once a month for a series of five. The first series of five began on January 15, 2012 and culminated on <strong>May 23, 2012 with a Puja ritual<\/strong> and a <strong>Q &amp; A session with Charles Muir<\/strong>, the author of <strong>\"Tantra: the Art of Conscious Loving\"<\/strong> followed by the <strong>Beginner's Workshop\u00a0on May25, 26 &amp; 27, 2012<\/strong> when he was joined by <strong>Leah Alchin<\/strong>.

Although some members have found romantic matches through the group, it was a result of our friendly, respectful, and pressure-free environment that we have created.<\/p>\n<p>3. Update your RSVP if you can no longer attend an event. It is important that we have an accurate headcount for our events, and \"no show\" members take RSVP slots from other members. If you are a \"no show\" more than twice, you will be removed from the group.<\/p>\n<p>4. Take responsibility for your safety. We ask that you make smart choices about your personal well-being and physical safety both during and outside of events. Although we will do our best to prevent accidents, we are not responsible or liable if something happens.<\/p>\n<p>5. Post a current self-photo to your profile and answer all profile questions. This makes finding you at events easier and helps us cater events based on your interests.<\/p>\n<p> <br> To maintain our group's inclusive and welcoming atmosphere, we ask that you adhere to the guidelines above. After reading our profile above, we hope you will join our group! We look forward to meeting you soon!<\/p>","lon":-70.9000015259,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/8\/highres_195602232.jpeg","photo_id":195602232,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/8\/600_195602232.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/8\/thumb_195602232.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":70528882,"name":"Noor"},"members":620,"name":"The Original North of Boston 20's to 30 Somethings","id":3238042,"state":"MA","urlname":"The-Original-North-of-Boston-20s-to-30-Somethings","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Friends"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1328517513000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"musicians","name":"Musicians","id":173},{"urlkey":"graphicdesign","name":"Graphic Design","id":781},{"urlkey":"comedy","name":"Comedy","id":1001},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"publicspeaking","name":"Public Speaking","id":9300},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"singers","name":"Singing","id":17301},{"urlkey":"performing-arts","name":"Performing Arts","id":17558},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"film-and-video-production","name":"Film and Video Production","id":20021},{"urlkey":"live-theatre","name":"Theater","id":23274},{"urlkey":"song-writing","name":"Songwriting","id":72969}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Express-Yourself-Boston\/","rating":4.85,"description":"<p>Are you creative, love sharing ideas and play well with others?

It is part of a global, grassroots movement with thousands of members in over 150 countries, which links the pleasure of food with a commitment to community and the environment.<\/p>\n<p>Slow Food is a volunteer run organization committed to building communities through the food we eat. Slow Food\u2019s foundation is in the promotion that all foods should be GOOD, CLEAN and FAIR for all. This means that we are collectively committed to supporting efforts to make our food supply more sustainable, cleaner, and available to consumers. Are you interested in sourcing foods that are more nutritious and delicious for your family? Well the Slow Food movement has grown now to more than 500 chapters around the world including over 225 chapters here in the United States. Slow Food even has nearly a dozen chapters here in New England and we collaborate our leadership together as Slow Food New England.<\/p>\n<p>Here at Slow Food Boston we work to promote foods grown and produced first here in Massachusetts but also throughout New England. We seek to raise awareness of sustainability issues and to host events that are just plain fun. After all, if you don\u2019t enjoy your food, why bother eating it? Life is too short to eat fast food.<\/p>\n<p>What is Fast Food?<\/p>\n<p>We all take for granted the process in which most of our food gets to our local marketplaces to satisfy our taste and demand for convenience. Much of our food supply is harvested now in large quantities in remote lands including Mexico. Our foods are grown on large farms and to maximize the farmer\u2019s yield a massive amount of insecticides, growth hormones, antibiotics, and genetically modified seeds and species are introduced into our food supply. These foods are therefore rushed to harvest and then rushed to market on large boats and trucks typically requiring transportation of several thousands of miles. This is Fast Food! And we at Slow Food Boston look to change this process by educating our community about alternatives that make our foods more delicious and nutritious.<\/p>","lon":-71.0999984741,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/8\/3\/6\/highres_233662582.jpeg","photo_id":233662582,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/8\/3\/6\/600_233662582.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/8\/3\/6\/thumb_233662582.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":39199882,"name":"Slow Food Boston"},"members":1202,"name":"Slow Food Boston","id":3336732,"state":"MA","urlname":"Slow-Food-Boston","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1329922628000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"sales","name":"Sales","id":16},{"urlkey":"ai","name":"Artificial Intelligence","id":456},{"urlkey":"hadoop","name":"Hadoop","id":18060},{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"machine-learning","name":"Machine Learning","id":29971},{"urlkey":"data-analytics","name":"Data Analytics","id":30928},{"urlkey":"data-visualization","name":"Data Visualization","id":37381},{"urlkey":"predictive-analytics","name":"Predictive Analytics","id":38458},{"urlkey":"data-mining","name":"Data Mining","id":55324},{"urlkey":"r-project-for-statistical-computing","name":"R Project for Statistical Computing","id":98380},{"urlkey":"data-science","name":"Data Science","id":102811},{"urlkey":"big-data-analytics","name":"Big Data Analytics","id":383411},{"urlkey":"the-art-of-business-negotiations","name":"The Art of Business Negotiations","id":674662}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Data-Scientist\/","rating":4.46,"description":"<p>This group will concentrate on understanding the tools and skill-sets needed to become an effective Data Scientist.

Rather than rushing around taking thousands of photos, we learn to stand still, be present and see the beauty of the moment right before our eyes. Then we discover the most astonishing photos are not taken by us, but given to us. Photography offers a path to mindfulness and can be a form of meditation that connects you to the beauty of daily life. In this moment, we feel revitalized, refreshed, and awake!<\/p>\n<p>Do you love to just get so into taking photos you loose track of time? Or perhaps you would just enjoy learning how to take better photos? Either way, you will feel a deep sense of satisfaction and pleasure when you create photos using this method.<\/p>\n<p>You should join this group if you would enjoy exploring photography as a contemplative practice that connects you to the mystical, magical moments of beauty in daily life. Discover how to develop a good eye by taking photos while you are in the \"zone\" or flow state. Some simple mindful, meditation practices will be introduced.<\/p>\n<p>We will explore 8 secret universal patterns of beauty such as luminosity and vitality as lenses through which to see creatively and be connected to a subject. We will have lots of fun as we go with the flow!<\/p>\n<p>There are many different types of photography: landscape, portrait, night, each requiring basic photography knowledge and some special skills. Mindful photography is another type of photography you can add to your life purely for pleasure. The special skills required are focused more on your inner stance of stillness and quiet. Simple meditation practices are used to get grounded and centered before you click the shutter. That way you connect to the heart of the moment.

Naturism brings out the best side of people, and getting naked with friends is a wonderful exercise in shedding some of the shame that gets piled on by a judgmental and vain society. Don't think you look good naked? All the more reason to try it! Learn to be comfortable with your body with a group of liberal-minded friends with the same desire.<\/p>\n<p>I formed this group as the sole Beacon Of Hope in the area, and as an experiment to see what happens. I don't have a huge place but I can host a small get-together or a cookout, and I have friends who I might convince to let me use their places; we'll start small, and hope for more venues! Besides, we're making friends in the meantime! \"Build it and they will come!\" Your sexuality is not important because this is not a hookup or sex group--just casual friendly nudity and light hearted fun and adventure in clothing-free social activities.<\/p>\n<p>JOIN UP AND HELP ME CREATE SOMETHING DIFFERENT AROUND HERE!!

Perhaps you are ready to take that camera off the auto setting?<\/p> \n <p>Maybe you've taken a photography workshop before or tried picking up one of those thick, boring books, but you quickly got overwhelmed and overloaded with the technical stuff.<\/p> \n <p>You don't intend on becoming a \"master photographer\", but you'd like to learn how to take better pictures of things you find interesting.

This unique approach encourages you to slow down, take fewer photos of higher quality by experiencing the beauty of your life.<\/p> \n<\/ul>\n<p>And the best part?

They have native intelligence, talent in mathematics and science and are responsible for numerous major technological advances. They not only possess knowledge of theory, but also how to apply that theory to real world problem solving and the creation of marvelous inventions. It\u2019s unfortunate that they are so often unsung heroes.<\/p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are often broad brushed as near mythical, larger-than-life, demi-gods. We live in an unprecedented time in history. The world economic crisis has many questioning their ability to survive. In a rare move, both democrats and republicans agreed on the JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startups) act and the president signed the bill in April to pave the way for new startups to more easily access financing.<\/p>\n<p>There comes a point in some engineers\u2019 careers when thoughts turn to having a more important role in society. They\u2019d like to make a contribution and do work that has more meaning. The thoughts of others turn to starting their own business, they want to be their own boss, control their own destiny. Perhaps all they desire is a way to perform work using a broader range of their talents instead a narrowly defined skill set. At this unprecedented time in US history however, one can both start their own business and do a great service to their country by employing some of the 40 million that have lost their jobs.<\/p>\n<p>Engineering Entrepreneur is a group for engineers who either are or would like to be either self-employed or business owners capable of employing others. With a background in counseling, engineering and entrepreneurship, I decided to start this group to provide opportunities to engineers interested in entrepreneurship.

We don't have much time so let's get started.<\/p>\n<p>It is not necessary to write an introduction or post a photo to become a member, however this is not a debating society and people who support so-called \"death with dignity\" will be politely asked to take their arguments elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Fifth-Commandment\/about\/\">LEARN MORE.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : center\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : center\"><strong>Suicide is always failure ... and failure is not an option.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : center\"><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/0\/7\/2\/event_124632402.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px\"><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : center\"><strong>The Good Samaritan<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : center\"><strong>by Tissot<\/strong><\/p>","lon":-71.0899963379,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/0\/7\/2\/highres_124632402.jpeg","photo_id":124632402,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/0\/7\/2\/600_124632402.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/0\/7\/2\/thumb_124632402.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":5589752,"name":"Doug Fuda"},"members":6,"name":"The Fifth Commandment","id":3950812,"state":"MA","urlname":"The-Fifth-Commandment","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Norwood","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1338345058000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"christiansocial","name":"Christian Social","id":10187},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"christian-singles-marriage-minded","name":"Christian Singles Marriage Minded","id":15378},{"urlkey":"christian-singles","name":"Christian Singles","id":16271},{"urlkey":"newly-divorced","name":"Newly Divorced","id":16687},{"urlkey":"christian","name":"Christian","id":17963},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"single-dads","name":"Single Dads","id":18711},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"christian-young-adults","name":"Christian Young Adults","id":45354},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"single-parties","name":"Single Parents","id":59433},{"urlkey":"divorced-dads","name":"Divorced Dads","id":62436},{"urlkey":"divorced-with-kids","name":"Divorced with Kids","id":107487},{"urlkey":"christian-divorced-dads","name":"Christian divorced dads","id":153026}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Christian-Dating-Social-Events-Norwood-South-of-Boston\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Christian Singles are ready to mingle!&nbsp; Let's plan some singles events!<\/p>","lon":-71.1999969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/0\/5\/highres_438003077.jpeg","photo_id":438003077,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/0\/5\/600_438003077.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/0\/5\/thumb_438003077.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":58664542,"name":"Laura"},"members":185,"name":"Christian Dating\/Social Events, Norwood, South of Boston","id":3966282,"state":"MA","urlname":"Christian-Dating-Social-Events-Norwood-South-of-Boston","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":42.1899986267,"who":"Singles"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Arlington","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1338381920000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"jazz","name":"Jazz","id":131},{"urlkey":"blues","name":"Blues","id":135},{"urlkey":"musicians","name":"Musicians","id":173},{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"livemusic","name":"Live Music","id":8652},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"music","name":"Music","id":15018},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"singers","name":"Singing","id":17301},{"urlkey":"performing-arts","name":"Performing Arts","id":17558},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"concerts","name":"Concerts","id":18909},{"urlkey":"live-music-dancing","name":"Live Music & Dancing","id":20099},{"urlkey":"live-theatre","name":"Theater","id":23274}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonlive\/","rating":4.42,"description":"<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you like live music and don't always want to be in a venue in Boston, this is the group for you!

If you are going to be inactive for over 3 months, please let an Organizer know.<\/li>\n<li>If we find that someone is not active based on the above criteria, the person will be warned once and then removed from the group if activity doesn\u2019t pick up.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Members due<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There is a $6 non-refundable annual fee that is used to c<span>over Meetup cost, e<\/span><span>ncourage more engaged members, s<\/span><span>nacks for playgroups,<\/span> <span>organizers meetings and the Helping Moms group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><strong>Playdates<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>There are a lot of us, so we encourage you to host\/attend playdates throughout the South Shore.

If you live in the MetroWest\/Greater Boston area and want to meet people with similar interests, then join our group and come to an event!<\/p>\n<p>Check us out on Facebook! <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/HappyGeeks\">www.facebook.com\/HappyGeeks<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>Group Rules<\/span><\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p>Be respectful and courteous of your fellow group members. This includes using polite behavior as well as exercising proper hygiene :). <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Please note that we are not a singles group! <\/b>Of course, it is inevitable people will meet and fall in love in this group, but we are primarily here to make friends and share activities and interests with each other. Please don't expect to meet your soul mate or \"hook up\" with people. Treat everyone, regardless of gender or relationship status, with respect! <br><\/p>\n<p>Only RSVP to an event if you are able to attend. <strong>Three \"no shows\" will get you removed from the group<\/strong>. Telling someone in advance that you will not be able to make it will not count against you. <br><\/p>\n<p>Please read event descriptions carefully! If an event host says to bring food, drink or cash to pitch in, you are expected to follow through. <br><\/p>\n<p><strong>We only accept members who are 21+<\/strong>. The age range for our meetup members is 20's and 30's. If we discover that you are not 21, you may be removed from the group. <br><\/p>\n<p><strong>All members are required to have one personal photo (a picture of their face) in their profile photo file<\/strong>. We will turn down applications with no picture or pictures with non-visible faces. <br><\/p>\n<p>You're expected to have a name that you go by as part of your meetup profile. This is for safety purposes as well as to help event organizers mark your attendance correctly. A first name or nickname is fine. <br><\/p>\n<p>You're expected to remain active in the meetup group. This means you should visit the page at least once per month or so to check out what events we've got going on. <b>We will remove any members who have been inactive for 6 months. <\/b> <br><\/p>\n<p>A part of being in the meetup group is receiving communications from organizers. These are typically important updates and you are expected to read them. If you feel you are getting too many e-mails from Meetup itself, you may adjust your e-mail settings on the meetup page (this is not something that we can control). <br><\/p>\n<p>You can e-mail me at any point through the e-mail on my profile page. <br><\/p>\n<p>***PLEASE READ THIS ACCIDENT WAIVER OF RELEASE OF LIABILITY AS IT APPLIES TO ANYONE WHO PARTICIPATES IN ANY HAPPY GEEKS OF GREATER BOSTON EVENT, ACTIVITY, OR POST.***<\/p>\n<p><strong><span>ACCIDENT WAIVER AND RELEASE OF LIABILITY FORM<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>BY AGREEING TO AN ACCEPTANCE IN BECOMING A MEMBER OF HAPPY GEEKS OF GREATER BOSTON YOU ARE AGREEING TO ABIDE BY THIS DISCLAIMER.

So where are all the LGBT rowers? I want to start a meetup group that will let us meet and socialize without making people commit to being part of a boat that has an ongoing practice schedule.<\/p>\n<p>So this meetup is starting out as a SOCIAL group. This is NOT a learn-to-row group, and it is NOT being organized to line up nine people to go out in a boat. Maybe later, but just now right now.<\/p>\n<p>For people who have gotten in touch with us because you want to learn to row, first of all: Hooray for you! You're going to love it. Then, what you should do is to get in touch with either Community Rowing or Boston University. They both have great learn-to-row programs, and you'll be out on the water in no time this summer. Here's their URL's:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.communityrowing.org\/signup\/new-to-rowing\/\">https:\/\/www.communityrowing.org\/signup\/new-to-rowing\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bu.edu\/fitrec\/programs\/noncredit\/rowing.shtml\">http:\/\/www.bu.edu\/fitrec\/programs\/noncredit\/rowing.shtml<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Some background on me: I rowed freshman and intramural crew at Harvard, and now I'm rowing a single out of Community Rowing. But I travel a lot for work, and so being part of an eight just wouldn't work for me. Just the same, I could imagine going out on the water every now and then in a pick-up boat, perhaps with adult supervision from a coach at one of the boathouses. And for the scullers among us, it would be nice to connect with other people to go out on the water with, either in singles or in doubles.<\/p>\n<p>IN SUMMARY: if your experience with rowing involves being on the water, and when you're inside you refer to those godawful contraptions as \"ergs\" and not as \"rowing machines\", then you're somebody who should join this group. There are hundreds of us LGBT rowers out there in the Boston area -- we're just waiting to finally meet each other.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/1\/0\/highres_129826352.jpeg","photo_id":129826352,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/1\/0\/600_129826352.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/1\/0\/thumb_129826352.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":26010052,"name":"David McIntosh"},"members":89,"name":"Boston Gay Rowers","id":4099112,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Gay-Rowers","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1340115250000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"agile-project-management","name":"Agile Project Management","id":21549},{"urlkey":"agile-coaching","name":"Agile Coaching","id":122939},{"urlkey":"customer-experience","name":"Customer Experience","id":127127},{"urlkey":"agile-leadership","name":"Agile Leadership","id":438272},{"urlkey":"agile-transformation","name":"Agile Transformation","id":438282},{"urlkey":"agile-marketing","name":"Agile Marketing","id":1085592}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Agile-Marketing-Group\/","rating":4.88,"description":"<p>The Boston Agile Marketing&nbsp;meet-up is a group of forward thinking&nbsp;marketers, who seek to understand the New Marketing and how best to manage marketing in a digitally disrupted world.

Allow them to present their views in similar fashion &amp; stay open-minded. When they present a valid point admit it. Be humbled enough to edit &amp; alter your own views when someone presents something convincing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>2. Arguments &amp; Disagreements are an essential part of this group. Someone does not hate you if they disagree. Keep the focus away from person &amp; onto the issue itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>3. No rambling; keep the discussion moving &amp; give others a chance to talk. This is not a monologue but a discussion. If you desire to present on a topic that can be the time for your monologue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>4. Because of negative past experiences, we do not encourage political arguments to take over the topic at hand. If we decide to schedule a specific political issue, it will be clearly stated ahead of time, with clear guidelines that every participants will have to adhere to.<\/span><\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/2\/4\/e\/highres_136529262.jpeg","photo_id":136529262,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/2\/4\/e\/600_136529262.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/2\/4\/e\/thumb_136529262.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":19674751,"name":"Madeleine Kando"},"members":386,"name":"Idealists and Rationals of Boston","id":4252002,"state":"MA","urlname":"Idealists-and-Rationals-of-Boston","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Intuitives"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1341700035000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"neighbors","name":"Neighbors","id":4189},{"urlkey":"urbanexplor","name":"Urban Exploration","id":4331},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"exploring","name":"Exploring","id":17522},{"urlkey":"community-outreach","name":"Community Outreach","id":19164},{"urlkey":"community-building","name":"Community Building","id":20727},{"urlkey":"boston","name":"Boston","id":31254},{"urlkey":"civic-engagement","name":"Civic Engagement","id":37181},{"urlkey":"discover-your-neighborhood","name":"Discover Your Neighborhood","id":47316}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonExplorers\/","rating":4.82,"description":"<p>Boston is a great city but after having lived here for some time I've come to realize most people don't get out and explore beyond their own neighborhoods. Every neighborhood in Boston though has something neat about it though so I started this group as a way for proper Bostonians to meet other proper Bostonians from other neighborhoods who have settled here too. This group is for people who like living in urban environments and call Boston their home. From East Boston to West Roxbury, the North End to the South End, Roxbury to Roslindale, everybody in Boston is welcome. I can't forget about the near by cities either- that's you Cambridge, Somerville, Chelsea, and Brookline.<\/p>\n<p>We do events in all the Boston area neighborhoods but especially focus on Boston city proper. I have a talent for finding local festivals, free concerts, and nice parks to visit. I also lead walks around different neighborhoods I've researched the history on myself. In addition there are plenty of weeknight game, pub trivia, and lectures around town.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Group Rules<\/strong>: I put a lot of work in to the meetup group and I've very serious about creating a community here. The theme of this community is cities, urban issues, and exploring our neighborhoods. To be successful in creating that community the group must have rules. Here are the rules:<\/p>\n<p>#1 - <em>The group is primarily intended to be for people who have settled in the city<\/em>. Let's face it - Boston is a pretty transient place so people who actually decide to settle in Boston are a pretty small bunch on meetup. The intention of this group is to be a way for those people to meet. Therefore the primary audience is not people just visiting Boston, here temporarily, or from the suburbs. There are many other new to Boston and groups for general audiences but that is not this group.<\/p>\n<p>#2 <em>This group is not for people who want to anonymous.<\/em> It doesn't make for a friendly meeting up experience without knowing who you're meeting up with. To that end it is required you use your real first name in your profile and a recognizable picture is required to join and stay. I'd also encourage you to fill out the profile with something interesting about yourself.<\/p>\n<p>#3 <em>Three no shows and you're out<\/em>. I put a lot of work in making events work so I ask members to put some effort in to actually showing up. I take attendance at events and if you show a pattern of not showing up you'll be removed from the group.<\/p>\n<p>#4 <em>Please check the site every 6 months.<\/em> I very purposefully am trying to keep this group small and active. The only way to keep it small is to remove \"dead\" profiles.

In Reiki TUMMO, Spiritual progress is based on learning to use your heart more in your daily life and opening your heart for true insight and understanding.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>Through a series of gentle steps and courses, Reiki Tummo prepares the foundations to support your continuing spiritual growth and development.

Our 1,000th class was on 10 March 2011.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>&nbsp;Our purpose is to improve our health and also make friends. We provide a safe environment where men can gain the physical benefits of yoga (strength, balance, focus, calmness, better blood circulation) and the &nbsp;social benefits of a friendly, encouraging community of men. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>We get naked. We practice yoga. We don't care if you are young or old, straight or gay, black or white,&nbsp;sculpted or sagging. We welcome students of all levels, including beginners. We take pride in our respectful, supportive, and friendly but non-cruisy atmosphere. We are refreshingly free of \u201cattitude\u201d. Class duration is 90 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the nature of our class, we are careful about whom we invite to our studio. If you are accustomed to other Meetup groups where anonymous people are invited as casually as if the event were a frisbee toss in the park, have patience. We provide a safe environment because of our intentions and the fact that we screen first-timers before inviting them.<\/p>\n<p>1) You will need to send a&nbsp;<b>direct email<\/b>&nbsp;via Comcast (NOT via Meetup) to Bobby, the founder\/organizer, who will then reply with introductory messages (too long to include here).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>First use<\/p>\n<p>yoga4men@comcast.net<\/p>\n<p>If no reply within a reasonable time, you may try<\/p>\n<p>default.catchall@here-and-now.com<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;2) Although you are free to use a different name in class,&nbsp;<b>y<\/b><b>ou must provide your real name<\/b>&nbsp;to the instructors and the two organizers. Your full name is not absolutely necessary for your first message to Bobby, but is needed to proceed further. Your nickname or screen handle is not an acceptable substitute. You must be prepared to show valid identification at your first class.<\/p>\n<p>3) &nbsp;You must read and agree to the rules.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>About this Naked&nbsp;Yoga Class - The Rules<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>1) This group is for men only. This is one of the attributes that make it unique.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>2) This group is open to all men regardless of sexual&nbsp;orientation. It is not about sex, cruising or voyeurism. Members&nbsp;are free to disclose or hide their sexual orientation. Members do not&nbsp;assume that any other member is gay or is available for any&nbsp;relationship outside class.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>3) During class, members do their best to concentrate on their&nbsp;breathing, posture or other aspects of the exercise. Looking at&nbsp;someone in order to understand the pose while exercising is OK;&nbsp;sitting back and staring is not. Those who find themselves unable to&nbsp;keep up with the exercises are asked to go into a rest pose rather&nbsp;than watching the class.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>4) Members who feel attracted to others in the class do their best not&nbsp;to make it obvious to anyone during class. Members are expected to be&nbsp;equally friendly and helpful to all others in the class, regardless of&nbsp;any erotic attraction, or lack thereof. Spontaneous erections, if they&nbsp;occur, are treated as natural, involuntary and unremarkable and not&nbsp;taken personally; we simply continue our exercise without&nbsp;comment. What we wouldn't like is any deliberate erotic gesture or&nbsp;intentional distraction from the purpose of the class.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>5) Those whose bodies are far from ideal are just as welcome as anyone&nbsp;else. We are in this group to improve ourselves and help each&nbsp;other. We respect any man who shows up and works at the exercises, no&nbsp;matter how he looks to us today. When we choose partners for&nbsp;stretching or other exercises, our ideal is to spend our time equally&nbsp;with all other possible partners.We do not favor or disfavor anyone&nbsp;based on age or looks. Please note:&nbsp;We do partner work only in infrequent special sessions, always announced in advance.&nbsp;In our regular classes we have no occasion to touch each other.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>6) We respect the owners, manager and other users of the space we are&nbsp;in. &nbsp;and the privacy of the class. Drop-ins and guests must at least&nbsp;speak with a class member prior to class time before being invited to&nbsp;join us. We will not disclose the specific location of the studio&nbsp;except to those who understand and accept our philosophy. If anyone&nbsp;else asks us where we meet, it is OK to say \"a dance studio in Central&nbsp;Square\" but nothing more specific than that.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>7) Naturist etiquette applies. Among other things, this means:<\/p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>a) We&nbsp;stay within established nude areas.<\/p>\n<p>b) We respect the rights and property of others<\/p>\n<p>c) No photos without prior permission.<\/p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>8) This is a naked class. The only exception is for the instructor.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>9) You are responsible for your own safety. It is up to you to know&nbsp;your limitations and make sure you don't injure yourself. In&nbsp;particular, if you have conditions such as glaucoma or high blood&nbsp;pressure, you should avoid inverted poses. If unsure, consult your&nbsp;doctor before attending this class.<\/p>","lon":-71.0999984741,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/4\/0\/4\/highres_143297412.jpeg","photo_id":143297412,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/4\/0\/4\/600_143297412.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/4\/0\/4\/thumb_143297412.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":732459,"name":"Robert"},"members":632,"name":"Naked Yoga for Men (Cambridge, MA)","id":4312962,"state":"MA","urlname":"NakedYogaForMen","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Yogis"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1342400768000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"technology","name":"Technology","id":10579},{"urlkey":"music","name":"Music","id":15018},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"mobile-technology","name":"Mobile Technology","id":16216},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"music-industry","name":"Music Industry","id":50913},{"urlkey":"music-technology","name":"Music Technology","id":61313}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Music-Technology-Group\/","rating":4.86,"description":"<p>The Boston Music Technology Group is a community for entrepreneurs, hackers, founders, developers, designers, programmers, musicians, idea-ists, scientists, and data experts, who are currently working in a music-tech space, or looking to join a music-tech startup.

Additionally, we attempt to capture measurable, verifiable evidence using such tools as nightvision camcorders, EMF meters, remote temperature sensors, digital voice recorders, Geiger counters, motion sensors, digital still cameras, and similar technologies.

Each meeting, the group is facilitated by nonprofessionals. It is important that you know that we are simply a group of concerned people helping people. Tremendous bonds of friendship have been forged and continue beyond the scope of the group. The comfort that you will find in this group has helped hundreds of people over the years and is a testimony to the longevity of the group. You be the judge...we invite you to attend our next meeting.\u00a0 Everyone that attends our meetings, understands what is said in the meeting, stays in the meeting. Confidentiality is respected and you are encouraged to speak on your own terms and when you are ready. Meetings generally last approximately two hours.<\/p>\n<p>There are social opportunities that take place in addition to our meetings, if you choose to participate. The comment is often made that people wish they had found this group sooner. Several members who at one time were going through the divorce process continue to stay active in the group because they feel that they have something to share with others who are going through this phase in their life. We hope you will join us, and know what types of activities you would like to see.<\/p>\n<p>We are concerned about your safety and privacy.\u00a0 The settings are designed so that group events and members are only seen by people inside the group.

This is not only unfair to our new members would like to become a part of the group but also to our members who all stand around waiting for you to show up but to other members who would like to attend these events and can't because spaces are full. I know things come up and everybody has an off week so I will allow three strikes for this new policy, but our new rule will be as follows. If you are a no-show or no call for any meet up to which you have RSVP'd yes it will count as a strike against you.

The meetups will be at several different Dog parks so everyone has a chance to be a part of the fun!<\/p>","lon":-71.0299987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/1\/7\/highres_433856855.jpeg","photo_id":433856855,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/1\/7\/600_433856855.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/1\/7\/thumb_433856855.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":66456862,"name":"Joshua Lakin"},"members":241,"name":"Shiba Inu Meet Up Boston Area","id":4607802,"state":"MA","urlname":"BostonShibas","category":{"name":"pets\/animals","id":26,"shortname":"pets-animals"},"lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Shiba Inu's"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Lowell","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1345649642000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"sailing","name":"Sailing","id":1176},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"science-fiction","name":"Science Fiction","id":18864},{"urlkey":"dog-walks","name":"Dog Walks","id":18874},{"urlkey":"dinner-and-a-movie","name":"Dinner and a Movie","id":23778},{"urlkey":"spontaneous-fun","name":"Spontaneous Fun","id":30449},{"urlkey":"last-minute","name":"last minute","id":35925},{"urlkey":"north-of-boston","name":"North of Boston","id":45547},{"urlkey":"dinner-and-drinks","name":"Dinner and Drinks","id":61459}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Spontaneous-Fun\/","rating":4.48,"description":"<p>I want to try an experiment.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine a typical weekday after a long day at work. You finally get home, collapse onto the couch, click on the television\u2026and then you remember\u2014you have a petting zoo meetup to go to in 45 minutes. Problem is you don\u2019t want to go to the petting zoo. Sure, it seemed like it\u2019d be a hoot when you signed up for it eight weeks ago, but dammit your feet are tired, and you just want to relax, and besides\u2014the new episode of Space Commandos is on tonight. So regretfully you cancel. I know\u2026you promised yourself you\u2019d get out more often, meet exciting people, go on more adventures, but tonight just ain\u2019t the night for it.<\/p>\n<p>Two days later, you arrive home from work vibrant, with pep in your step and rocket fuel in your veins. You\u2019re ready to party! Or at least do some karaoke, local trivia or a late night screening at the old-timey movie theater. You\u2019d even go to the petting zoo tonight, and pet those little animals like a champ. And look! There\u2019s a cool meetup tonight at that awesome restaurant you\u2019ve always wanted to\u2026oh wait, the meetup\u2019s full. No big deal, here\u2019s another one at that hip bar you\u2019ve heard about, Fangtasia. Nope, that one filled up weeks ago. Here\u2019s one that still has an opening, quite a few openings actually\u2026My Little Pony playgroup? Not exactly what you had in mind. \u201cWhy can\u2019t there be more spontaneous people like me\u201d, you think to yourself as you settle in for another re-run of Space Commandos.<\/p>\n<p>Sound familiar, or is it just me? My schedule is unpredictable, so it\u2019s hard to know when I\u2019ll be available next month. And, besides, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be in the mood for a petting zoo on the first Friday in October. Maybe I\u2019ll be more in the mood for a whiskey and grilled cheese breakfast\u2026or a My Little Pony party\u2026I doubt it, but stranger things have happened. The point is I\u2019d like to find out, and so my experiment: Spontaneous Fun.<\/p>\n<p>The idea is for a more spontaneous meetup, one that will focus on scheduling things later that same day, maybe even two or three days in advance, but nothing greater than a week. Maybe you\u2019ll get a meetup notice one afternoon for a get-together for drinks later that evening, or for a night at the drive-in theater tomorrow night. I\u2019ll focus on things that interest me (obviously), and ask for ideas from you as well, things like: drinks after work, a drive-in movie tomorrow night, or maybe an explosion-laden action film at Jordan\u2019s IMAX on Sunday, a cool restaurant in the area one or two days in advance, a True Blood marathon (don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s a show) or Game of Thrones season premier, a casual hike in the area, dog park meetup (we\u2019d have to bring dogs, otherwise that\u2019d be weird), things like that. I\u2019m open to get-together\u2019s in Boston, but there are already a million meetups in Boston\/Cambridge; I\u2019d like to see more stuff happening north of the city.<\/p>\n<p>So, whether you\u2019re the spontaneous type who prefers to follow your whims, or you simply forgot to pay your electric bill and now have nothing to do, come out and join us.<\/p>","lon":-71.3399963379,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/f\/0\/highres_151527632.jpeg","photo_id":151527632,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/f\/0\/600_151527632.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/f\/0\/thumb_151527632.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":161691332,"name":"William Barnes"},"members":1872,"name":"Spontaneous Fun","id":4613932,"state":"MA","urlname":"Spontaneous-Fun","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":42.6500015259,"who":"Spontaneous Fun-seekers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"members","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1345692872000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"ivy-league-business-networking","name":"Ivy League Business Networking","id":67806},{"urlkey":"ivy-league-grads","name":"Ivy League Grads","id":79733},{"urlkey":"ivy-league-singles","name":"Ivy League Singles","id":147066}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ivyleagueBoston\/","rating":0,"description":"<p style=\"text-align : center\"><strong><span style=\"color : #222222 ; font-size : x-large\">The Ivy League Alumni Club of Boston<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : center\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : center\"><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/4\/e\/0\/event_155738112.jpeg\" width=\"528\" height=\"345\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : center\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : center\"><span style=\"color : #222222 ; font-size : small\">Welcome, Boston Ivy Leaguers!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #222222 ; font-size : small\"><br>\n\n We are a <strong>face-to-face social network<\/strong> of alumni from <strong>Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, Upenn, and Yale<\/strong>.

I find learning tunes at sessions to be impossible, and while it is enjoyable to learn and play music at home, it would be fun to get together with others to play occasionally. I started this group to see if there are others like me. To start, we are meeting once a month to play tunes at a\u00a0fairly\u00a0slow tempo.<\/span><br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n <span>Because the goal is to learn tunes and to practice playing with others I'm guessing that this group will be made up of beginning and intermediate level musicians (If good anchor musicians want to show up all the better), and that we will choose sets of tunes to work on. This way everyone gets to play. Of course, this is all open to what the group wants to do as a whole. Tempos will be anywhere from slow (while everyone is first learning a tune) to comfortably fast (once we've learned a tune). I'd like to keep one specific monthly Meetup away from blistering tempos, although if anyone wants to become an assistant organizer to schedule something more like a session for this Meetup, they are more than welcome (I'll pay the Meetup fee. Anyone who becomes an Assistant Organizer will not have to contribute. The yearly fee is not a lot of money.)<\/span><br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n <span>My motivation comes from years ago when I belonged to a CCE Branch in Utica NY. We used to play together weekly, usually in someone's dining-room or living-room. It was a lot of fun to get together. And we all knew a common set of tunes after playing together for many years. Of course we had a great anchor musician, a guy who grew up in Ireland playing accordion. He was patient, and quite tolerant :) CCE in Boston does have Sunday sessions in Watertown, but they don't have a tune list as far as I know. And Watertown is a bit far from the T.<\/span><br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n <span>The format is open to whatever the group decides: We can start with new tunes played slowly, and work our way to tunes we have learned well, picking up the tempo as we go. We could also just mix new sets with old sets. I think the first format might be better if better musicians want to show up later to play faster tunes. This depends on who joins. Currently, I'm working my through Malley's 100 Essential Irish Session Tunes. We can choose to go through a collection like this (All great tunes), or we can put our own setlist together.<\/span><br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n <span>So here is to whatever happens!<\/span><\/p>","lon":-71.1200027466,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/2\/d\/e\/highres_155453982.jpeg","photo_id":155453982,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/2\/d\/e\/600_155453982.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/2\/d\/e\/thumb_155453982.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3554217,"name":"David G"},"members":210,"name":"Somerville Irish Music Meetup","id":4740542,"state":"MA","urlname":"Somerville-Irish-Music-Practice-Session","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":42.4000015259,"who":"Musicians"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1346774500000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"survivalism","name":"Survivalism","id":3372},{"urlkey":"self-sufficiency","name":"Self-Sufficiency","id":16025},{"urlkey":"primitive-skills","name":"Primitive Skills","id":17662},{"urlkey":"homesteading","name":"Homesteading","id":18527},{"urlkey":"emergency-preparedness","name":"Emergency Preparedness","id":23570},{"urlkey":"survivalist","name":"survivalist","id":37589},{"urlkey":"preppers","name":"PREPPERS","id":43275},{"urlkey":"outdoor-survival-skills","name":"Outdoor Survival Skills","id":48158},{"urlkey":"food-storage-for-emergencies","name":"Food Storage for Emergencies","id":54315},{"urlkey":"prepping","name":"Prepping","id":65766},{"urlkey":"wilderness-survival","name":"Wilderness Survival","id":66483},{"urlkey":"disaster-preparedness-skills","name":"Disaster Preparedness Skills","id":111996}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Massachusetts-preppers\/","rating":4.86,"description":"<p>Massachusetts Preppers is a group for people who feel there is a need to prepare for an event that will completely alter \u201clife as we know it today\u201d.

The idea is simple: write a bit, optionally read, and possibly grab a bite afterward. No cost, no strings, no commitment, and all are welcome. \u00a0 Each meeting will start with around one hour of writing anything you like. Then, after brief introductions, anyone who wishes may read what they wrote. If there is interest, some of us may grab dinner afterward. Although you have to sign up for the group, there is no cost, optional (and non-committal) RSVPing, and no attendance limit. We'll simply announce our meetings, and you can do as you please. Stay on the list as long as you wish, come as little or as much as you like, stay only for writing or reading, etc. You can choose to always read, never read, read on prime days ... there's no pressure. Ideally, we'll meet once every week or two. All types of writing are welcome. In the NY group, people wrote stories, poems, screenplays, journal entries, pieces of novels, memoirs, and essays. One even wrote computer code (fortunately he never read it :) The group should be thought of as a safe place for writers to come together, and hopefully it will spawn collaborations, friendships, and some interesting work.<\/p>\n<p><strong><br>\n\n<\/strong><\/p>","lon":-71.0999984741,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/c\/c\/highres_170448332.jpeg","photo_id":170448332,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/c\/c\/600_170448332.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/c\/c\/thumb_170448332.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14139255,"name":"Ken H"},"members":796,"name":"Cambridge and Boston Friendly Writing Group","id":5451592,"state":"MA","urlname":"Cambridge-Boston-Writing-Group","category":{"name":"literature\/writing","id":18,"shortname":"literature-writing"},"lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Writers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1350666248000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"classics","name":"Classic Books","id":506},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"fiction","name":"Fiction","id":15113},{"urlkey":"reading","name":"Reading","id":15360},{"urlkey":"readers","name":"Readers","id":17219}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Book-Club-for-Heartbreaking-Geniuses-and-Those-Who-Love-Them\/","rating":4.65,"description":"<p>This is a group for all those who miss the pleasure of digging into a new book with the knowledge that on the other side of the cover they will have the opportunity for engaging conversation!

Is it just a playlist of music that each person dances to? What kind of dancing, what kind of music?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\"><span style=\"color : #800080 ; font-size : medium\">The answers are: No, you don't need to know how to dance at all. \u00a0You don't even need to be mobile for that matter. A member came who couldn't dance and she sat and swayed and played the drum. And the group included her and made her feel valued and loved and accepted and completely part of the experience. This all happened spontaneously, because deep down in our souls joy and love are only waiting for permission to express themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\"><span style=\"color : #800080 ; font-size : medium\">The music I choose is deeply evocative and pulled from all musical genres -- deep drum beats, lilting melodies, and haunting strains that encourage opening up to what arises in the moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\"><span style=\"color : #800080 ; font-size : medium\">The space is safe and sacred and most people find initial anxiety melting away within minutes of the dance starting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\"><span style=\"color : #800080 ; font-size : medium\">We all intuitively understand that music has the power to move us. \u00a0If we give them permission, emotions become energy in motion. \u00a0When we open up to what is present in the moment, we see that our feelings want us to dance them. And if we dance them, old wounds heal, knots loosen, we shake off heaviness, despair lifts, sadness flows away and we begin to feel our joy rise right from our tippy toes to our fingers and all the way up through the tops of our heads. \u00a0We feel exhilarated, happy, clear, purposeful and finally at peace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\"><span style=\"color : #800080 ; font-size : medium\">Through skillful facilitation and careful selection of music we will undertake a transformative journey into our deep selves. We will do this together for the human condition is not one of disembodied spirit wandering the earth alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\"><span style=\"color : #800080 ; font-size : medium\">We honor the need for connection because it is through connection that we learn about the world, other people, and ultimately ourselves. \u00a0We will dance in a large group, alone, in small groups and one on one. You will dance in safety and in sacred space. No previous dancing experience is necessary--everyone can dance their life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #ff00ff\"><strong>In Deep Dance Light Spirit you can expect a large dose of fun as well as a physical, emotional and spiritual work(ing)-out.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>For more information, please go to <strong><span style=\"color : #000080\">www.deepdancelightspirit.com<\/span><\/strong><\/p>","lon":-71.1299972534,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/a\/e\/highres_223368302.jpeg","photo_id":223368302,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/a\/e\/600_223368302.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/a\/e\/thumb_223368302.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":74429142,"name":"Lara Seven P."},"members":145,"name":"Deep Dance Light Spirit","id":6570812,"state":"MA","urlname":"DeepDanceLightSpirit","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Light Spirits"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1357765078000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"c","name":"C\/C++","id":1327},{"urlkey":"csharp","name":"C#","id":2260},{"urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript","id":7029},{"urlkey":"mswindows","name":"Microsoft Windows","id":10105},{"urlkey":"android-developers","name":"Android Development","id":20346},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"xna","name":"XNA","id":23043},{"urlkey":"windows-phone","name":"Windows Phone","id":51642},{"urlkey":"html5","name":"HTML5","id":78565},{"urlkey":"windows-game-development","name":"Windows Game Development","id":82605},{"urlkey":"windows-phone-developers","name":"Windows Phone Developers","id":133497},{"urlkey":"mobile-game-development","name":"Mobile Game Development","id":138175},{"urlkey":"windows-8-development","name":"Windows 8 Development","id":438992},{"urlkey":"windows-8-metro-app-development","name":"Windows 8 Metro App Development","id":450862},{"urlkey":"windows-8","name":"Windows 8","id":752732}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Windows-App-Developers\/","rating":4.68,"description":"<p><span style=\"font-size : large\">Welcome, Boston-area Developers!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This Meetup is a way for all app builders, from new to experienced,\u00a0to\u00a0learn, share,\u00a0and\u00a0create apps and games with the help of Microsoft and the area's community of developers and designers.<\/p>\n<p>Already have apps or games on Android, iOS, or other platforms?\u00a0 We absolutely welcome you to join in to share your experiences and connect about opportunities for your app and cross-platform development for Windows 8 and Windows Phone.<\/p>\n<p>We'll feature a variety of events, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Workshops<\/strong> -

You must have \"touch\" to play balizinha, anything less will slow down the speed of play.<\/p>\n<p>The balizinha meetup is capped at 18 players (6 teams of 3 players each).&nbsp; We have a predetermined schedule and each team is guaranteed at least four (4) games, with the cap in place you will most likely get five (5) \/six (6) games.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because everyone has registered as a \"free agent\", teams are chosen at random and because we have quality players, there is no telling who will be the best team that day.<\/p>\n<p>Atmosphere:<\/p>\n<p>We are a pretty cool group with people from all over the world that understand the same language, the language of futbol.&nbsp; We usually have samba (brazilian carnival music) playing in the background and we encourage people to stay on their feet and play the ball.&nbsp; We all have work on Monday, so we play hard within a certain limit.<\/p>\n<p>About Balizinha:<\/p>\n<p>Balizinha (root word \"baliza\" (ba-lee-za) means goal in Cape Verdean\/Portuguese Creole, any time you add \"inha\" (een-yah) to a word, it means that it is small.&nbsp; \"Balizinha\" literally means small goals.<\/p>\n<p>The game is played on hard top (basketball court) with a maximum of six (6) people on the court, three (3) people on each team.&nbsp; The goals are 3x3, so a player's accuracy will be tested and the futsal ball moves quickly, so the players will require \"touch\".&nbsp;

I started this groups because I find myself always talking about my natural hair with friends, colleagues and even strangers. I have been leaning that the upkick of the natural hair movement is about more than \"just hair\". It relates to healthy choices and living as close to the earth as possible through our product choices, especially as women and people of color who have been disparately exposed to toxins in our neighborhoods, hair products and lack of access to healthy food. We will explore and discuss the psycology and culture of hair, maybe read a book or two about it, discuss how our hair impacts us at work and home, but primarily trade styling and healthy hair care tips, maybe even swap products or organize local larger scale natural hair meetups, all while having fun. Fashion talk to go along with our fabulous curls and locs and styling tips are a major part of this as well! Is it JUST hair?? !

In the end, it is not for anyone else but you yourself. Meditation removes the blindfold, the darkness that covers our eyes from the truth. Meditation generates the inner light that gives us vision to see just what is really happening around us. When you attain true bliss and happiness inside yourself through meditation, you will feel so overwhelmed with joy that you will not be able to adequately find words to describe it. No one can do this for you, you have to attain it yourself in order to understand how it feels. When you eat a chili, for example, others may ask you how it tastes, but you can only tell them that it is spicy. They do not really know what spicy means until they try it for themselves. Thus, you cannot describe inner happiness to others. You cannot attain inner peace for others and others cannot attain it for you. This is the truth of life. You must do it for yourself. Embrace the simple relaxed dhammakaya meditation technique that can be used by people of all faiths, regardless of nationality or race to attain inner happiness. Our meditation sessions are conducted by Dhammakaya practitioners who have committed their lives by ordaining to teaching meditation and dhamma (reality of life). They are eager to teach their technique and wisdom on meditation methods, benefits and knowledge gained from meditation, and our true purpose. Every session will be inspiring and will help encourage one to meditate. Though many of us are aware that meditation can help reduce stress, there is still so much more to learn from benefits of meditating.

Any one particular approach may not necessarily be \"right\" for you at this point of your journey, but many approaches are here for you to try on -- to utilize or to set aside as you decide -- depending on how well they appear&nbsp;<i>to you<\/i>&nbsp;to support what you want to create in your life. <br> <br>For you personal growth &amp; development leaders, PGN provides you with a giant toolbox that helps you to more easily share your concepts, techniques, tools, and love with the larger personal growth community. Given PGN's interest in collecting diverse techniques towards diverse goals, our community is \"open\" and \"non-denominational\". PGN welcomes effective approaches from any positive psychology or cognitive discipline:<\/p>\n<p><span>\u2022&nbsp;<\/span><b>National approaches&nbsp;<\/b><span>(e.g., Insight, LOA, Forum, HAI, Dale Carnegie, MAP, MDI, NLP)<span> <br><\/span><\/span><span>\u2022&nbsp;<\/span><b>Home-grown approaches<\/b><span>, developed by local members and drawn from many disciplines.<span> <br><\/span><\/span><span>\u2022&nbsp;<\/span><b>Study groups<\/b><span>, organized by members like you, supporting one other, perhaps practicing particular approaches more deeply or working together towards a shared life goal (e.g., health, new business)&nbsp;<span> <br><\/span><\/span><span>\u2022&nbsp;<\/span><b>Social events<\/b><span>&nbsp;where you create fun events that combine connection, fun, and learning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The path that serves you best may not serve someone else; your path today may well change tomorrow. Our open, diverse, growing, networked community is intended to remain your primary resource for personal growth &amp; development tools and support. Use whatever serves you best -- to learn and grow and succeed towards your current goal -- and, once complete enough, refocus on your next goal, perhaps utilizing different tools, perhaps in a different part of your life.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Our community creates 100s of events:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>\u2022&nbsp;<\/span><b>Social events<\/b><span>: dances, parties, get-togethers, movies<span> <br><\/span><\/span><span>\u2022&nbsp;<\/span><b>Study groups<\/b><span>: interest groups, support groups, mastermind groups, book clubs&nbsp;<span> <br><\/span><\/span><span>\u2022&nbsp;<\/span><b>Formal presentations<\/b><span>: classes, miniWorkshops, workshops, retreats, seminars.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Thus, our community needs many organizers to create this abundance.

This group is slowly taking on a colorful flavor of personalities.. not a big surprise lol. Our meetings have been slow to start but some of that has to do with health issues, sadly most members suffer from one or many painful chronic health problems. On the up side, we share a common solution that alleviates some of the pain. At this point, We all expect mmj to stay legal.<\/p>\nAnyway, a few guidelines for this group: No advertising on your personal profile. No private emails for networking or directly to individuals for building a patient list. And don't use the comment wall as an opportunity to mention your product. Come to a meeting. That's the purpose of the group! No posting your link on this group site. The sponsor request link is in the left column to see if you match our group needs. Formally, we are an educational group for individuals (not corporate entities). Bringing the public, medical marijuana patients, caregivers and interested parties together for the purpose of discussing use of medical marijuana in New England. If you are considering the option of medical marijuana as a more reasonable alternative to narcotic and prescription medication, then this group will help provide access to other like-minded individuals. If you are a Legal patient through the Department of Health's Medical Marijuana Registry and are looking for support, our group might fit your needs. We are completely neutral and non-judgemental in every aspect of your personal and private lives. \n<p>Regarding cannabis use at our events: Be respectful of other members during events. When in doubt, think of cannabis use similar to alcohol use. If you are out of control is anyway then it is uncomfortable for people around you. Unfortunately, our society has a high value on self control. Another consideration is that other members may not have access to products and may be a bit envious of your supply. We only ask that your medical condition is certified in writing by your doctor and that you have obtained the documentation required by the State that permits you to possess medical marijuana.<\/p>\n(Ignore the last profile question and type your favorite color instead) Thanks for joining our group.","lon":-71.5299987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/6\/4\/highres_214204452.jpeg","photo_id":214204452,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/6\/4\/600_214204452.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/6\/4\/thumb_214204452.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":9404589,"name":"Andrea"},"members":117,"name":"New England Medical Marijuana Discussion Group","id":7638222,"state":"MA","urlname":"New-England-Medical-Marijuana-Discussion-Group","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":42.2200012207,"who":"Patients, Growers, Caregivers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1363460184000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"sewing","name":"Sewing","id":1111},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"electronics","name":"Electronics","id":7848},{"urlkey":"diy","name":"DIY (Do It Yourself)","id":10438},{"urlkey":"technology","name":"Technology","id":10579},{"urlkey":"hacking","name":"Hacking","id":21123},{"urlkey":"arduino","name":"Arduino","id":39012},{"urlkey":"makers","name":"Makers","id":43887},{"urlkey":"gadget-lovers","name":"Gadget Lovers","id":67098},{"urlkey":"makerspaces","name":"Makerspaces","id":101438},{"urlkey":"3d-printing","name":"3D Printing","id":114528},{"urlkey":"screen-printing","name":"screen printing","id":138150},{"urlkey":"diy-technology","name":"DIY Technology","id":153215},{"urlkey":"open-source-hardware","name":"Open Source Hardware","id":403852},{"urlkey":"hackerspace","name":"hackerspace","id":949612}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cambridge-Hackspace\/","rating":4.91,"description":"<p>This is a group for anyone and everyone who enjoys making awesome stuff.

This meetup functions as movement to spread awareness about the benefits of meditation, and hosts meditation and breathing workshops, meditation mixers, and free meditation experience sessions. Most of us are now leading hectic professional and personal lives. In fact, the busier one is the more one has to meditate. Meditation, when used as a daily practice helps one dive inward to the source of joy, energy and creativity and come out into activity more able to practically express these qualities in our lives. Backed by science and personal experience, corporations and other institutions are now offering mediation workshops.

Haha. Yes...If you are not aware of this game, we admit that the name seems odd...BUT, it is the real name for the most exciting, fun, and competitive indoor\/outdoor game that men and women are falling in love all over the country and beyond! In other states, Cornhole is known as Baggo, Bags, and Tailgate Toss. Cornhole was born in Western Ohio. The origin of the name is simple: 6\" Bags filled with corn, that you throw into a hole. Sounds easy right? Well, although it takes about 2 minutes to learn, it can take a long time to master. Many people love playing the game, because there are not many sports that you can play, while holding a beer or drink in your hand. It has become a tailgating staple, and a back yard cook-out favorite. Beantown Cornhole LLC is a company that is dedicated to spreading this game to others in not only Boston, but all over Massachusetts and New England. We have weekly Events, Tournaments, Leagues, and more. We offer fundraising opportunities to charities and non-profit organizations. We also provide rentals and even sell the highest quality Cornhole Boards and Bags that you can find. Our goal is to spread the love of this game, through meet up...to meet and make friends with others who love to have fun while meeting others.<\/p>","lon":-71.0800018311,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/1\/7\/6\/highres_272933622.jpeg","photo_id":272933622,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/1\/7\/6\/600_272933622.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/1\/7\/6\/thumb_272933622.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":90204722,"name":"Lisa Crowell"},"members":44,"name":"Beantown Cornhole - New England's 1st Cornhole Meetup Group","id":8156222,"state":"MA","urlname":"Beantown-Cornhole-New-Englands-1st-Cornhole-Meetup-Group","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Baggers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1366565224000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"bike","name":"Bicycling","id":579},{"urlkey":"road-cycling","name":"Road Cycling","id":17259},{"urlkey":"cycling","name":"Cycling","id":18617},{"urlkey":"bicycle-touring","name":"Bicycle Touring","id":36803},{"urlkey":"bay-area-bicycle-touring","name":"Bay Area Bicycle Touring","id":42183},{"urlkey":"bicycle-commuting","name":"Bicycle Commuting","id":47860},{"urlkey":"cycling-for-fitness","name":"Cycling for Fitness","id":58196}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-s-North-End-Cycling-Club\/","rating":4.93,"description":"<p><strong>This group is for busy city dwellers with an active interest in recreational and sporting cycling.

However, feel free to email the organizers (boston[at]pyladies[dot]com) anytime if you are having trouble getting setup for a meeting. We also get there about 30 minutes early as well and are happy to help before (or after!) the meetup. The expected level of knowledge is just basic Python. Questions are always welcome, but if it's really basic, we will ask you if we can answer it later. If you can, also come grab a drink with us after the meetup!<\/p>\n<p><b>Beginner meetups<\/b>: Bring on your install problems! This is 100% about making sure beginners are up and running. Our beginner meetups are weekly (alternating Saturday and Sunday) and are project based. Don't have a project? No problem! You can still come and we'll help you get started.<\/p>\n<p><b>Hack Days<\/b>: We like building things together! Open to suggestions as to what we should build. We have coded our website during a hack day and have plans to build Django apps in other hack days. In general, we'll spend at least two hours trouble shooting installs, then the next four actually building something cool!

We will meet once a month - usually the evening of the first Tuesday - at a member's home on the North Shore. The North Shore Page Turners will be a very dynamic group of women who share one thing in common: an enthusiasm for books. Each month, members read a particular book, chosen by the whole group or by the Organizer, and meet to share observations, insights, and personal thoughts about it. Meetings are devoted to various genres, both contemporary and classic. The club's members may represent a variety of backgrounds and literary tastes, bringing wonderful diversity to each book discussion. The North Shore\u00a0Page Turners Club will hopefully thrive on both the celebration of literature and the camraderie of its readers. More importantly, the club values the ideas of its members, allowing everyone a chance to suggest book selections and other ideas for making this club a lively group to participate in. I had established a similar book club while living in San Francisco and met some wonderful friends and fellow readers. I am hoping this east coast north shore version, will inspire inspired new and ongoing interest in reading. The club will read everything from historical fiction and literary works to thrillers and graphic novels. Thanks to its members, the club will aim to be an engaging book interest group, discussion forum, and social club all rolled into one. The mission of the North Shore Page Turners Club is simple: provide an opportunity to explore the excitement of literature, one of humankind's oldest forms of leisure, and to meet like-minded people along the way. The book for each month will be chosen by a mixture of voting and consensus. Our discussions include both the book itself and the issues it raises. They are lively, informal, and respectful of everyone's view. We will be an enthusiastic bunch of women who love books and we look forward to meeting you!<\/p>","lon":-71.0299987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/4\/6\/6\/highres_244045702.jpeg","photo_id":244045702,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/4\/6\/6\/600_244045702.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/4\/6\/6\/thumb_244045702.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":10428610,"name":"Kathleen"},"members":51,"name":"North Shore Page Turners","id":8762232,"state":"MA","urlname":"North-Shore-Page-Turners","category":{"name":"literature\/writing","id":18,"shortname":"literature-writing"},"lat":42.5400009155,"who":"Page Turners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Swampscott","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1370288348000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"wahm","name":"Work at Home Moms","id":4082},{"urlkey":"workingmoms","name":"Working Moms","id":10555},{"urlkey":"womens-business-networking","name":"Women's Business Networking","id":21283},{"urlkey":"mompreneurs","name":"Mompreneurs","id":23247},{"urlkey":"women-small-business-owners","name":"Women Small Business Owners","id":23633},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273},{"urlkey":"moms-in-business","name":"Moms in Business","id":35766},{"urlkey":"professional-moms","name":"Professional Moms","id":36233},{"urlkey":"female-entrepreneurs","name":"Female Entrepreneurs","id":41905},{"urlkey":"womens-networking","name":"Women's Networking","id":43484},{"urlkey":"mom-entrepreneurs","name":"Mom Entrepreneurs","id":83279},{"urlkey":"momtrepreneurs","name":"Momtrepreneurs","id":94394}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Momtrepreneurs-of-Massachusetts-and-NH\/","rating":0,"description":"This group will cater to moms who are or want to be entreprenuers and the challenges of juggling family life and business life and give solutions and share ideas of other successful momtreprenuers.","lon":-70.9100036621,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":92098512,"name":"Shelly Duyen Vu"},"members":58,"name":"Momtrepreneurs of Massachusetts and NH","id":8767482,"state":"MA","urlname":"Momtrepreneurs-of-Massachusetts-and-NH","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":42.4700012207,"who":"momtrepreneurs"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1370304721000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"survivalism","name":"Survivalism","id":3372},{"urlkey":"self-sufficiency","name":"Self-Sufficiency","id":16025},{"urlkey":"primitive-skills","name":"Primitive Skills","id":17662},{"urlkey":"homesteading","name":"Homesteading","id":18527},{"urlkey":"organic-gardening","name":"Organic Gardening","id":20465},{"urlkey":"emergency-preparedness","name":"Emergency Preparedness","id":23570},{"urlkey":"apocalypse","name":"Apocalypse","id":31428},{"urlkey":"preppers","name":"PREPPERS","id":43275},{"urlkey":"outdoor-survival-skills","name":"Outdoor Survival Skills","id":48158},{"urlkey":"prepping","name":"Prepping","id":65766},{"urlkey":"wilderness-survival","name":"Wilderness Survival","id":66483},{"urlkey":"urban-survival","name":"Urban Survival","id":74865},{"urlkey":"hiking-walking-camping-rafting-fishing-canoeing","name":"Hiking Walking Camping Rafting Fishing Canoeing","id":102283}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-England-Preppers\/","rating":4.86,"description":"<p>This group is about getting ready&nbsp;with survival skills and\/or prepper skills in any situation whether a real bad snow blizzard, a hurricane or other natural disaster,&nbsp;an economic collapse,&nbsp;

Do you use a financial management tool like Mint.com? Then you might be a quantified self.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We're all generating lots of data, whether actively recording it or using transactions, apps, and sensors to generate the data. What do we do with that data? What can it tell us about ourselves?<\/p>\n<p>People in the Quantified Self community have been self-tracking and analyzing their data in novel ways. We are doing experiments, running correlations, fostering new habits. More tools are entering the consumer market to make it easier for us to track ourselves without much effort and we're starting to find tools that help us make sense of our disparate data sets. It's not just geeks or science bros running statistical correlations in R. Creating data can be just as useful as a tool for building awareness about a goal you have.<\/p>\n<p>Women's voices in the QS community are underrepresented, even though we've all been tracking things forever. We're hoping to change that. What does your data tell you about yourself? What can women learn when they take advantage of the existing data, and use more tools to generate novel data about our bodies, minds, and our environment?\u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n We want to create a <span>space for all the interesting, women specific QS conversations we want to have.

It's since been expanded to the general Boston Harbor area, including Boston, Cambridge, the harbor islands, Quincy, Hingham and Hull.<\/p>\n<p>There are alot of kayaking groups in New England, but not many that focus on the Boston region in particular. For me, I like to spend a lot of time in the waters of these areas, since they are local to me. As it just so happens, this region as a whole makes up one of the best paddling destinations one could ever hope to find.<\/p>\n<p><span>The variety found around here is extraordinary. Obviously there are lots of urban settings. Add to that Boston Harbor, Quincy Bay, Hingham Bay and World's End ... not to mention the many picturesque islands and lighthouses ... and you truly have a world-class area in which to paddle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So I'd like to see this group consist of a plethora of Boston-area excursions. Frankly, I'm gunna be in the water around there half the time anyway, so might as well do it with friends, old and new!<\/p>\n<p>Also, I've found alot of groups that seem to have far too few events at will encompass beginners. Sure, people who are farther along in things want to have a challenge, but I don't like to see people left out. We all were beginners once, and I like to remember that.<\/p>\n<p>So if you're an experienced kayaker who hopes to share some paddling time with others, or if you're someone just looking at getting started, I want this group to be something fun for you.

Mostly the book club part of this group is to get ideas for good reads from people, read something 'together' and use the book as a launchpad for conversation. I do not envision it being rigid or handing out bulleted discussion point lists. I'd love to go see movie versions of books we read and complain how bad they were. And just to meet nice, like minded people. About me: I'm 39 and have always been a voracious reader (some times in my life more than others, there were years when the books I read to my kids were the only ones I read). Here are some books I've enjoyed lately: Fiction: Toni Morrison - The Bluest Eye and the Song of Solomon, Barbara Kingsolver: The Prodigal Summer, The Bean Trees, Stephen King: 11\/22\/63, Alice Sebold: The Almost Moon, Kathleen Kent: The Wolves of Andover, Annie Proulx: Fine just the way it is, Mitch Albom: The 5 People you meet in Heaven...... \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Memoirs: Cheryl Strayed: Wild, Alice Sebold: Lucky, Mitch Albom: For one more day, J Maarten Trost: Getting Stoned with Savages, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Non-Fiction: Bill Bryson: A Short History of Nearly Everything, A Walk in the Woods, Nathaniel Philbrick: Heart of the of Sea, The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex, Marlene Zuk: Sex on six legs, Stephen Puleo: Dark Tide.

for riders of 2 or 3-wheeled motorized vehicles. It doesn't matter what you ride, only that you ride. Our group is about enjoying the backcountry roads of New England at a leisurely pace, in groups of 10 or fewer motorbikes and in a relaxed social atmosphere. Our rides often stop for a meal, ice cream stand, etc. along the way. Typically, our rides start\/end at various places between the 128 and 495 belts.<\/p>\n<p>We typically avoid highways, but on the rare occasion that we touch an interstate we will make our plans clear and keep the interstate travel quick and painless. Our ride leaders set a pace that is within 5-10 MPH of the posted speed limit. If you have the need for speed, this may not be the group for you.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re also about safety. We believe in \"Safe Riding Skills\" which includes following the MSF Group Riding protocol. The protocol is available by clicking \"More\", then \"Files\" from our home page. Boston\u2019s Countryside Cruisers\u2019 riders must have a minimum of 1- year or 1000 miles of riding experience and adhere to the MSF Group Riding protocols [<a href=\"http:\/\/www.msf-usa.org\/downloads\/Group_Ride.pdf\">or click here for PDF copy of MSF's Guide to Group Riding<\/a>]. You must be comfortable, and have the riding skills necessary to safely ride in a staggered motorcycle formation. This means that you must be able to safely maintain a 2-second gap between you and the bike in front of you, without drifting from side to side in your lane. You must also be able to understand, act on, and pass along group hand signals. Our ride leaders provide a safety briefing before each ride which reviews these hand signals [<a href=\"http:\/\/www.msf-usa.org\/downloads\/Group_Ride.pdf\">click here and see Page 3 of MSF's Guide to Group Riding<\/a>].<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/0\/5\/600_440523845.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>It is free to join, and there are annual dues of $5.00 after a 30 day try out period. You will be asked to sign an annual liability waiver; a copy of which is available for review on our Group's webpage.<\/p>\n<p>We will often stop at locally owned counter service establishments that are inexpensive and casual.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever a ride is posted there will be a tentative map, a list of planned stops and we will try to end up near or at where we started.<\/p>\n<p>Riders are always welcome to leave early, but please communicate this with both the Ride Leader &amp; the Sweep so that no one is waiting and wondering.<\/p>\n<p>The cruisers are based around Boston. Rides will start somewhere outside the city and head out for some great country roads.<\/p>\n<p>We will ride on many weekends in the spring summer and fall and will try to host a series of Thursday night rides and Wednesday night bike nights to break up the week as well.<\/p>\n<p>All Boston's Countryside Cruisers rides will:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Be open to all 2 or 3 wheeled motorized conveyances.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Be thoughtfully planned.<\/p>\n<p><b>\u2022&nbsp;BE DRUG\/ALCOHOL FREE<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Have 10 or fewer vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Stay within 10 mph of the speed limit nearly all of the time.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Choose back roads over highways.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Be a relaxed and fun way to meet other riders.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Come out and ride with us!<\/p>","lon":-71.1299972534,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/9\/4\/highres_434211604.jpeg","photo_id":434211604,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/9\/4\/600_434211604.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/9\/4\/thumb_434211604.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":176758612,"name":"\"TJ\""},"members":48,"name":"Boston's Countryside Cruisers","id":9991172,"state":"MA","urlname":"CountrysideCruisers","category":{"name":"cars\/motorcycles","id":3,"shortname":"cars-motorcycles"},"lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Cruisers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Needham Heights","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1377621163000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"ballroomdance","name":"Ballroom Dancing","id":3998},{"urlkey":"latin-dance","name":"Latin Dance","id":17993},{"urlkey":"dance-lessons","name":"Dance Lessons","id":19146},{"urlkey":"ballroom-latin-salsa-swing-tango-hustle","name":"Ballroom, Latin, Salsa, Swing, Tango, Hustle","id":20839},{"urlkey":"ballroom-dancing-basics","name":"Ballroom Dancing Basics","id":44931},{"urlkey":"social-dancing-ballroom-and-latin-beginner-class","name":"Social Dancing Ballroom and Latin Beginner Class","id":61660},{"urlkey":"learn-ballroom-dancing","name":"Learn Ballroom Dancing","id":63874},{"urlkey":"ballroom","name":"Ballroom","id":78777},{"urlkey":"ballroom-dance-lessons","name":"Ballroom Dance Lessons","id":94731},{"urlkey":"ballroom-dancing-lessons","name":"Ballroom Dancing Lessons","id":112279},{"urlkey":"latin-ballroom-dancing","name":"Latin & Ballroom Dancing","id":117154},{"urlkey":"ballroom-dance","name":"Ballroom Dance","id":125637},{"urlkey":"ballroom-dancing-for-beginners","name":"Ballroom dancing for beginners","id":402722}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Shall-We-Dance-Ballroom-Latin-Swing-Meetup-Needham-MA\/","rating":4.97,"description":"<p>This meetup is organized to help educate the public and increase awareness of the many positive physical, mental and social benefits of Ballroom Dancing.

We are a group of gamers in&nbsp;lower New England&nbsp;that meet up to play strategy board games, deck-building games, LCG's, and the like.&nbsp; We originally started in Metrowest, but have begun expanding beyond those boundaries to serve gamers across Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Connecticut.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, we have&nbsp;three weekly meetups (every Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday),&nbsp;four fortnightly meetups during the week (every other Monday and multiple events&nbsp;for Tuesdays),&nbsp;four monthly meetups on the first Thursday, the third Thursday, and the fourth Monday&nbsp;of the month plus one Friday night based on venue availability.&nbsp;On top of all that, we host&nbsp;one all-day event on a Saturday every quarter to&nbsp;play longer games that we are not quite able to get in at one of the weeknight meetups.&nbsp; There are also other occassional one-off meetups in addition to those and several several fill-and-fire events you can view by expanding the \"More Meetups\" at the bottom of the Upcoming Meetup list or at the Fill and Fire page (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MetrowestBoardGaming\/pages\/Fill_and_Fire_Games\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TabletopGamersAlliance\/pages\/Fill_and_Fire_Games\/<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>This meetup group was established on September 10th 2013 and currently costs $144 per year to run (<a href=\"http:\/\/help.meetup.com\/customer\/portal\/articles\/465027-organizer-dues-price-plans\">Meetup.com Subscription Pricing<\/a>).&nbsp;
