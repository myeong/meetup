This is the Reality that we are now, after eons, beginning to wake up to. The planet with all that is on it, individually and collectively as a whole, is undergoing the transformation that we have been prepared for for a very long time. The purpose of this group work is to help facilitate this transformation and awakening.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>THE WORK<\/strong> we do here is the work of inner self. We do not just study spiritual truth only, although that can be tranformative in and by itself. What we will do is lay down the foundation and set the context for the work with spiritual truth. We then take a personal and experiential approach to make it operational and feasible in bringing real healing and expansion of awareness. The process serves as a catalyst in activating one's compassion, wisdom, and power from within. We bring this about by taking responsibilities, letting go of resistance and barriers, so that love and truth as Divine essence stands revealed as one&rsquo;s true Self. Hence it is a work of love guided by truth. It is an inner-self work done in group settings.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>THE GROUP<\/strong> is utilized to serve as a safe play ground and an incubator in which guidance and support is provided to those committed for their spiritual growth and breakthroughs. Each group session is designed to consist of the following segments: a brief dharma talk as introduction, introspection meditation, interpersonal play and group process, alignment meditation at closing. We use various exercises and tools to learn about ourselves both by going within ourselves and from one another.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Spiritual aspirants from all walks of life, devotees from all paths, seekers of all levels are honored and welcome. Having some in-depth alignment and experience with one or more of the following spiritual teachings, texts, teachers, or programs or others alike can be very helpful but not required:<br>\n\n Centering Prayer (Christian mysticism, silence meditation based on &ldquo;The Cloud of Unknowing&rdquo;)<br>\n\n Advaita Vedanta Nonduality<br>\n\n Zen or Mahayana Buddhism<br>\n\n Bhagavad Gita<br>\n\n Tao Te Ching<br>\n\n Dr. David R. Hawkins<br>\n\n Fr. Thomas Keating<br>\n\n Sri Ramana Maharshi<br>\n\n Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj<br>\n\n ACIM<br>\n\n 12 Steps<br>\n\n This \"space\" is intended to accommodate and support various needs at a range of levels. We welcome teachers, healers, and students who have long been on the spiritual path as well as people who have newly committed to spiritual work to join us.

Games to be played include Trivial Pursuit (natch),\u00a0 Blast From The Past, Chronology, Facts in Five, Finish Lines, The Logo Game, Newshound, Smart Ass, 20 Questions, Who Am I?, Wits and Wagers and more. Different games will be played at each meetup, and there's over\u00a030 games. Meetups will take place in Manhattan on weekends, at least twice a month, more often if the group catches on. IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ - while these games are mostly easy to learn and fun to play, they ask questions or provide clues to specific answers. Therefore, having general knowledge in various subjects is required to play and enjoy these games. For some games, you'll be on a team or partnered with someone, so it won't always be up to you to come up with an answer. But again, given the format of these games, a general knowledge in various subjects is required. Subjects covered include Geography, History, Literature, Science, Sports and the various areas of Pop Culture (Movies, Music, Theater and TV). If you're looking for games like Monopoly or Taboo, this is NOT the meetup group for you (there are meetup groups for those games, by the way). A list of the games to be played is shown in the Discussions section of these boards. If you've read the above and feel you qualify, sign up and join. If you know others who are trivia geeks, let them know about this group.

\u00a0-\u00a0CaptureTheLight - North New Jersey is changing directions: beginning by keeping all workshops and activities that are commercially driven away from the Meetup platform. \u00a0Those events and shooting opportunities will be kept at the sponsoring website: PhotoFusionUSA.com, or through \n\nTheModelsDen.\u00a0CaptureTheLight - North New Jersey will continue with a focus on social activities with photography as the main focus.\u00a0That means: more events, less money, more variety.\u00a0PhotoFusionUSA.com will step in as a sponsor for all CaptureTheLight meetups nationally. \u00a0What it means to you: from time to time you will receive perks exclusively offered to members of CaptureTheLight.To put everything into perspective, CaptureTheLight has chosen a not-for-profit organization, MyFace.org, to be the benefactor of all fees collected through CaptureTheLight meetups less the meetup dues and the paypal or CC fees of course. \u00a0The accounting records will remain open in this meetup group\u2019s money page so members can see for themselves how much money has been raised and how muxg was sent to MyFace.org.\u00a0Please take a moment to view MyFace.org\u2019s website, See for yourself what their mission is all about.It has been my experience: when meetups are free: everyone RSVP's and only 10% show up. \u00a0It\u2019s human nature.\u00a0To combat that, there will be a fee all events of $5, $10 or even more. Not for me. It\u2019s all for charity.\u00a0It\u2019s not much per person but when combining that with the other CaptureTheLight \u00a0groups on a regular basis, those small amounts ad up to a significant amount. \u00a0\nThis way, the fees collected are justifiable, they have merit and a purpose. CaptureTheLight is committed, just as I am, to help change the lives of many. I can\u2019t wait until the end of next year when we all see the total of all the small amounts we raised.\u00a0I feel compelled to ask members, those who can spare 2-4 hours a month, to help in in any capacity possible. Whether it\u2019s to come up with ideas for events, find venues, host events, etc.\u00a0The more events, the more money is raised, and the more active the group is. It\u2019s a win win for everyone! \u00a0Let's make his happen!\u00a0If you are interested in becoming an event-organizer, contact me at John@PhotoFusionUSA.com \u00a0PhotoFusionUSA.com is committed too! I'll be traveling nationally starting CaptureTheLight Groups to help raise awareness of MyFace.org and donating workshops as a means of fundraising. \u00a0Hang on to your hats as CaptureTheLight prepares for some exciting and rewarding events. Not just in SouthFlorida but in some great spots near and far.What a great way to make new friends. Whether you're married, single, young, mature (cough cough), this group is truly the melting pot of photographers.\u00a0Photography is, of course, the main subject. If you're into photography, join us! Bring your point-and-shoot or DSLR. Regardless of what camera you own, photography is photography whether you shoot with a cell phone or a Hasselblad.If you are looking to get into photography professionally, then PhotoFusionUSA.com is a great source to help you achieve your goals.

Divergent creativity flowers when limits on length (and size\/complexity) are combined with themes that encourage participation, provided the tools available make actual production and sharing quick and easy. It happened with short-form Japanese poetry as a mass participatory art several centuries ago and could happen with animation if we had the software and hardware needed to let laymen easily animate from scratch and control frame speed for better viewing. They are not because makers have focused on the pre-existent commercial CAD market and 3-D animation movies and games rather than developing tools for a market they cannot imagine. I believe that we can create and collect a body of work clearly demonstrating the overlooked potential of hypershort (as a rule, 100-frame or less*) animation that may convince makers to cooperate. Such must include interesting work by and surveys of groups of students who are not all art-majors, as showing off our best work alone will only prove we are an exceptionally creative group rather than proving the popular feasibility of the genre itself. Anyone interested in doing and\/or helping to develop hypershort animation is welcome to join whether or not you have animation experience to date, can draw well or think creatively. Please bear in mind the fact that even otherwise be boring or even ugly figures can prove very entertaining when animated. Even someone who draws poorly can be a star. Or, you can start with pre-existent figures in famous paintings or cartoons by Edward Lear or Thomas Hood and make them do something. If that is not easy enough, the work of animation may be split up. The larger theme, idea for the plot, frame-by-frame plotting and actual drawing might each be done by a different person. Team production in schools could even allow us to survey how far these talents overlap.<\/p>\n<p>*Longer work is possible where\u00a0many people work in serial, each contributing a given number of frames taking up where the other left-off.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Managing Co-organizer Wanted!<\/p>\n<p>Background: When I\u00a0moved to Brooklyn in Fall of 2011 and thought I\u00a0might stay,\u00a0this was \"Flipped-out in Brooklyn.\"\u00a0Now, I find I must return to\u00a0South Florida and concentrate on other work that cannot wait\u00a0(a huge book, in Japanese, of an obscure but important genre of poetry that I hope will pick up the spirits of Japanese) for at least a year. As most members of the group\u00a0were not in Brooklyn,\u00a0on May 31, 2012, I renamed\u00a0us Flipped-out in NYC and\u00a0increased my debt to pay\u00a0the requisite dues for another 6 months which should be time enough to find a co-organizer or managing director (?). Ideally, that person would have: 1) imagination enough to\u00a0see the unlimited possibilites of hypershort animation; 2) access to, or at least knowledge about,\u00a0software and hardware as members who lack the means to create\u00a0need help\u00a0-- perhaps a teacher or outgoing student at a top arts school or an independent artist, affluent and knowledgeable enough to make this possible; 3) the time to be fully engaged with others.\u00a0 To members of the original group, I apologize for not following through -- I knew I lacked 2) but after finding I had less funds but more research to do in\u00a0the limited time I had in NYC, learned too late that 3)\u00a0made it impossible to continue.\u00a0 I will continue as founding-member\u00a0as the concept of Flipping-out has been mine since the 1990's and I want to be part of what happens, but plan to\u00a0stay pretty-much hands-off.\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/a\/3\/2\/highres_73390802.jpeg","photo_id":73390802,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/a\/3\/2\/600_73390802.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/a\/3\/2\/thumb_73390802.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":1831396,"name":"robin d. gill"},"members":40,"name":"Flipped-out In NYC -- Hypershort Animation Initiative","id":2830762,"state":"NY","urlname":"Flipped-out-In-NYC-Hypershort-Animation-Initiative","category":{"name":"pets\/animals","id":26,"shortname":"pets-animals"},"lat":40.6599998474,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1321638650000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"metaphysics","name":"Metaphysics","id":774},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"psychics","name":"Psychics","id":1523},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"lawofattraction","name":"Law of Attraction","id":3382},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"mediumship","name":"Mediumship","id":16603},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"conscious-movement","name":"Conscious Movement","id":18717},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"spirtuality","name":"Spirtuality","id":53440}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-New-York-Heal-Yourself-and-the-Planet\/","rating":4.95,"description":"<p>This group is for spiritual people to come together to discover the divine inside and to bring that energy and transmit that energy out into the world.<\/p>\n<p>Inner peace is one of the most powerful gifts to embrace and acknowledge.

(Arabic: tasawwuf) is the mystical view and the inner dimension of Islam. For sufis themselves it means the complete religion, the realization of devotion to God, and the experience of love in the heart. In addition to the Islamic way of life, sufi followers engage with practices and prayers for the purification of the heart and improving one's character (adab). The loving guidance of the sheikh (the spiritual master) provides for certitude and clarity on the sufi way (tariqa). Burhaniya Disuqiya Shadhuliya is the sufi order (tariqa) of Sayyidi Ibrahim Qurashi Disuqi (13th Century A.D.), the fourth of the great sufi sheikhs and founders of sufi orders (aqtab). The spiritual line (silsila) of the Burhaniya sheikhs trace back to the Prophet Mohammed (s.). The Tariqa Burhaniya has spread out in the time of Sayyidi Fahruddin Sheikh Mohamed Osman Abduh al Burhani (\u2020 1983) and his son Sayyidi Sheikh Ibrahim Sheikh Mohamed Osman (\u2020 2003). Today, under the leadership of Sheikh Mohamed Sheikh Ibrahim Sheikh Mohamed Osman, there are thousands of followers and hundreds of Burhani communities all over the world.

Thus, &ldquo;Da Truth,&rdquo; was born. &ldquo;Da Truth,&rdquo; is a place where men and women can find out the answers to their questions and use this knowledge to improve their existing relationships or develop new loving relationships. It is also a place where new ideas and techniques can be discovered so that we can begin to close the communication gap between men and women.

The workshop follows the centuries old tradition of the education of emerging artists in the working studio of a professional artist. It is inspired by the artist&rsquo;s workshops of Renaissance Europe. These workshops existed, and still exist, in all cultures and historical periods. It is and was in these workshops where the application of the &ldquo;craft and science of art&rdquo; was practiced and taught to the emerging artists of the next generation centuries before art academies where established. It was, and still is, a creative environment where practice and theory work hand in hand. In these workshops of the past many fine works were produced and are now exhibited in museums and collections through out the world, and are the great treasures of human culture.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>The workshop is followed by a salon where lectures and videos are presented and discussed<\/strong> in a lively, erudite and friendly atmosphere. The intellectual process of learning about the history, philosophy and metaphysics of art is as important as the application of the science of art, in the making of art. So the Workshop &amp; Salon is both craft and theory oriented.<\/p>\n<p>As Leonardo Da Vinci said:<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>\"Those who are in love with practice without science are like the sailor who boards a ship without rudder and compass, who is never certain where he is going.<\/em>&nbsp;<em>Practice must always be built on sound theory.&rdquo;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Leonardo Da Vinci<\/strong><br>\n\n <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Artist<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;THE RENAISSANCE WORKSHOP &amp; ARTIST SALON<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Taught by Artist-Instructor: Ra&uacute;l-Santiago Sebazco<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>Diploma Graduate: National Academy School of Fine Arts \/&nbsp;New York University Bachelor of Fine Arts&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Winner of International travel grants to study at: Le Ecole des Beaux Arts, Paris, France<\/p>\n<p>Centro des Bellas Artes, Madrid, Spain<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/6\/6\/highres_82170822.jpeg","photo_id":82170822,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/6\/6\/600_82170822.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/6\/6\/thumb_82170822.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3020391,"name":"RSS"},"members":257,"name":"The Renaissance Workshop & Artist Salon","id":2993862,"state":"NY","urlname":"Renaissance-Workshop-Salon-for-the-Arts","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Emerging artists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1325102646000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"girlfriends","name":"Girlfriends","id":15144},{"urlkey":"girls-night-out","name":"Girls' Night Out","id":16550},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"new-york-city","name":"New York City","id":16809},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"young-adults","name":"Young Adults","id":17649},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SocialCircleNYC\/","rating":4.96,"description":"<p>Making new girlfriends in NYC can be awkward - approaching a girl in a bar who looks like a cool person just seems weird.<\/p>\n<p>This is the group for you if you're in your mid 20's - mid 30's, are new to the city or just looking for some fun, new, real friends.

This is not a superficial singles discussion; it\u2019s an exclusive social experience based on the concepts of Fromm, Maslow, Reich, Ellis, and other greats in humanistic philosophy and psychology. The philosopher Martin Buber said that life is an encounter with oneself, others and nature, but we need to have these encounters enhance warmth, mutual understanding and health. In this new series of Meet-ups, on the third Friday of each month, we will explore all the many aspects of interaction and relationships that ultimately make our lives more gratifying and effective. With guidance from an experienced group moderator, participants will create an experiential dialogue of sharing and learning, followed by relaxed socializing and light refreshments. The Humanist Inspirational Meetup is based on many years of highly successful development at the Humanist Foundation; its leader and counselor Joseph B. David has professionally conducted hundreds of humanist growth workshops and seminars. The hectic pace and complexities of today\u2019s life make this program a welcome setting for meeting like-minded people and exploring ideas together.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/8\/a\/highres_120334442.jpeg","photo_id":120334442,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/8\/a\/600_120334442.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/8\/a\/thumb_120334442.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":35230322,"name":"Alyson Ben David"},"members":137,"name":"Humanistic Interpersonal Social-Cultural Meetup","id":3104922,"state":"NY","urlname":"Humanistic-Interpersonal-Social-Cultural-Meetup","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"humanistic explorers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1326730102000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"spanish","name":"Spanish Language","id":183},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"bilingual-spanish-english","name":"Bilingual Spanish\/English","id":22885},{"urlkey":"espanol","name":"Espa\u00f1ol","id":25923},{"urlkey":"opera-theater-films-foreign-films-book-reading","name":"Opera, Theater, Films, Foreign Films, Book Reading","id":43780},{"urlkey":"latino-culture","name":"Latino Culture","id":74736},{"urlkey":"spanish-language-book-club","name":"spanish language book club","id":692952}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/En-Voz-Alta-NYC\/","rating":4.69,"description":"<p>En Voz Alta, un grupo de hispanohablantes (principalmente avanzados), es un C\u00edrculo Literario, en espa\u00f1ol que se reune semanalmente para leer, en voz alta, un libro escrito por un autor latino.

Toastmasters International is a well known not-for-profit organization and I invite you to visit their website at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.Toastmasters.org\">www.Toastmasters.org<\/a> to learn more. Toastmasters has helped many to overcome the fear of public speaking by building self confidence, leadership skills, networking and so much more. Come and see for yourself how this organization can help you. If you are already a Toastmaster, your visit will be greatly appreciated and welcomed. This group is open to everyone.<\/p>\n<p> Our club has an award winning profesional speaker who has also been involved in Toastmasters for many years and holds the highest honor for Toastmasters, the DTM designation. He can help you with your professional and personal speaking goals.&nbsp; The focus of our club is on advanced public speaking, but we welcome anyone who wants to join Toastmasters.&nbsp; Since we are an advanced club, a new member is expected to complete their first 10 speeches (the Competant Communicator series) in a more excelerated time frame than in a regular Toastmasters club.&nbsp; We will also view speeches from famous authors and professionals and see how we can incorporate those ideas into our speeches.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>If you have any presentations that you are creating for your career or other endeavors, our club is a great place to receive useful feedback and advice for your project.&nbsp; You want to move ahead and we can help you do that.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone can learn and network while having a good time and some laughs.

The CFB&rsquo;s mission is to increase voter participation and awareness, provide campaign finance information to the public, enable more citizens to run for office, strengthen the role of small contributors, and reduce the potential for actual or perceived corruption.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <em>The Voter Assistance Advisory Committee<\/em> (VAAC), was created by an amendment to the New York City Charter in 2010, to advise the New York City Campaign Finance Board on increasing voter participation and awareness, with special attention to groups and communities of residents that are underrepresented among voters, including civil rights and disabled groups. Under the leadership of its Chair, Art Chang, VAAC has also formed a <em>Digital Action Working Group<\/em> (DAWG) to identify and connect with partners in New York City&rsquo;s non-profit and technology communities who will help make this vision a reality.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<em>Art Chang, Chairman of the Voter Assistance Advisory Committee<\/em> and board member of the NYC Campaign Finance Board. Art is a serial entrepreneur who has helped create and restart over 30 private and public sector organizations. He is the founder and CEO of Tipping Point Partners, an \"institutional entrepreneur\" that serves as a seed investor and founder of software startups that build bridges between new technology and human needs, with a particular focus on using disruptive technologies to transform existing industries and government. Tipping Point believes that great software, applied intelligently, can result in positive social and economic change.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n\n<br>\n\nArt serves as CEO of two of Tipping Point's portfolio companies: Cookstr, a technology company dedicated to cooking and food, serving as a data-centered \"Switzerland\" for rights holders; and AppOrchard, an iOS development and software company that bridges the gap between consumer Apple devices and the needs of large enterprises.

Pit bulls and bully breeds are welcome! Don't have a dog? Adoptable dogs and fosters are welcome, as well!<\/p>\n<p>***Please note that if you would like to bring an adoptable dog from the Liberty Humane Society you must first be a registered volunteer who has completed the volunteer orientation and dog handling seminar.\u00a0 More information is available at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.libertyhumane.org\/volunteer.php\">http:\/\/www.libertyhumane.org\/volunteer.php<\/a>. \u00a0You will\u00a0also be responsible for transporting the dog to and from the pack walk.\u00a0 \u00a0Please have the adoptable dog wear an \"adopt me\" vest (provided by LHS) to get maximum exposure.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : center\"><strong>Mission Statement<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : center\">The purpose of Positive Pittie Pack Walk (PPPW) is to create a structured environment to exercise and socialize our dogs. We recognize the importance of being responsible dog owners in order to raise confident, stable dogs, while working towards improving the image of pit bull type dogs. We welcome all types of dogs, and encourage owners who are working on reactivity and socialization issues to join us. Our dogs are always in training, and PPPW strives to be a constructive experience for every dog and his owner, regardless of what issues they are working through.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : center\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In order to achieve our goals, all members must abide by the following rules. There will be no exceptions. Anyone who cannot abide by these rules will be asked to leave the group.<\/p>\n<p><strong>No dog interactions:<\/strong> at no point before or during the walk shall dogs be permitted to greet one another, sniff each other, etc. There will be no physical interaction between the dogs whatsoever. It is the rhythm of walking together as a pack that is a positive, dog-social experience. To that end, structured pack walking can be an incredibly therapeutic, rewarding experience for a dog. However, if you are looking for a group where your dog can \u201cmeet\u201d new dogs and play, this is not the group for you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Minimum one handler per dog<\/strong>: one human per dog, and one dog per human. Extra humans welcome to help organize the pack!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Respect Space:<\/strong> when we begin our walks, we will aim to keep approximately 5 feet between each dog. As the walk progresses, and the dogs get into the groove of pack walking, the distance between the dogs will likely reduce. Towards the end of the walk many dogs may end up walking side by side. Although, some dogs may require additional space throughout the entire walk.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Follow Instructions:<\/strong> A few organizers will be navigating throughout the pack as we move along. If an organizer asks you or your dog to move up towards the front or hang towards the back, please do so, and don\u2019t take it personally! The goal is to find where each dog fits in to the pack most comfortably, and modify accordingly. Every dog will be different.<\/p>\n<p><strong>No Retractable Leashes:<\/strong> in order to ensure that each handler has proper control of his or her dog, please use leashes of no longer than 6 feet, and leave the retractable ones at home.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Respect Local Laws and Ordinances:<\/strong> At no time will PPPW violate local leash laws, and all owners are expected to clean up after their dogs. Furthermore, please be sure that your dog has the proper licenses and vaccinations displayed on his collar before joining the group.<\/p>","lon":-74.0299987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/5\/1\/6\/highres_227322262.jpeg","photo_id":227322262,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/5\/1\/6\/600_227322262.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/5\/1\/6\/thumb_227322262.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":11680467,"name":"Jaime"},"members":210,"name":"Positive Pittie Pack Walk","id":3220942,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Positive-Pittie-Pack-Walk","category":{"name":"pets\/animals","id":26,"shortname":"pets-animals"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Pack Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1328217860000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"ebizowners","name":"E-Business Owners","id":1330},{"urlkey":"newcareer","name":"New Career","id":2790},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"business-coaching","name":"Business Coaching","id":12669},{"urlkey":"business-owners","name":"Business Owners","id":15417},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"small-business-networking","name":"Small Business Networking","id":20301},{"urlkey":"women-small-business-owners","name":"Women Small Business Owners","id":23633},{"urlkey":"career-transition","name":"Career Transition","id":24110},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"legal","name":"Legal","id":42294},{"urlkey":"woman-entrepreneurs-business-networking","name":"Woman Entrepreneurs Business Networking","id":96909},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-New-York-Small-Business-Support-Group\/","rating":4.89,"description":"<p>I started this meet-up group to form a support group for owners of small businesses.

If you'd like one of these slots, let us know! Otherwise, we'll pull names from a hat if you decide in-the-moment that you want to share. &nbsp;In addition to sharing stories informally during drinks before and after the event, you may be one of the 3-4 randomly selected shares!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>This is a fun, casual opportunity to share a unique story from your travels (domestically, internationally, or even from one side of the city to the other). A Travelogue can simply be a story told, but it also can take the form of a read: journal entry\/ blog, a shared photo\/ souvenir, a recited poem\/ song, or even a played video.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>WHO SHOULD JOIN?&nbsp;Those who are interested in travel.

Motorcyclers!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>QUEST! isn't an acronym. QUEST! is simply the gathering of people whom enjoy motorcycling adventures in whatever form they may appear! All types of motorcycles are welcomed. BMW, Ducati, Harley-Davidson, Kawasaki, Victory, Honda, Indian, Can-Am, Yamaha, etc.. You must be licensed, insured, &amp; be a responsible experienced motorcycle rider.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Picture this in your mind\u2026 It\u2019s a warm, sunny Saturday morning in June. Temps are expected to hover around 75 degrees. You\u2019ve had difficult days at work last week &amp; between piano lessons &amp; baseball practice for the kids you\u2019ve been running non-stop. You just changed the oil in the car and just sat down to relax and maybe have an ice cold one. As you reach into the fridge for what you thought was the last can of the six-pack you realize that you polished it off the nite before. Arrrgh! You\u2019re on empty! As you grab the car keys to head out to the local 7-11 your smartphone chimes. It\u2019s an alert that a brand new QUEST! Meetup is happening in a few hours. There\u2019s a ride to a classic car show at Bear Mountain and the Budweiser Truck (along with the Smoothie King truck for you non beer drinkers) will be there! There will be live music too!<\/p>\n<p>You can almost taste the ice cold fizz of the King of Beer\u2019s sliding down the back of your parched throat\u2026but you haven\u2019t started your bike all week. The chrome is dusty, you haven\u2019t checked your tire pressure in weeks, and you need to top off your tank. The QUEST! riders are meeting to ride up to Bear Mountain together so you gotta BOLT!\u00a0 You say to yourself \"It\u2019s never just a \u201cMeetup\u201d with that group\" so this may turn out to be a great day! Where's my microfiber cloths?\u00a0 Where's my wallet?\u00a0 Where are the keys to my bike? I think I\u2019ll put a hold on that frosty brew until I see the QUEST! riders. It's more fun with that merry band of misfits anyway...\"<\/p>\n<p>You can finish the story above any way you choose. We've played it out a hundred times since we began riding motorcycles. Whether in New York, Louisiana, Florida or Colorado. Motorcycle riders enjoy others who also ride! Motorcycle riders are a very tight knit bunch. You don\u2019t have to know the lady rider at the traffic light sitting on her bike waiting for the light to change. You give her a nod and a smile through your helmet. She\u2019ll smile back, give you the two finger flip and off you go! That\u2019s why I created QUEST!. To answer the call to RIDE!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Excitement. Laughs. Pure enjoyment of the road. \u00a0These are some of the things you'll be a part of with Quest! \u00a0Below are a few more...<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Call to Adventure<\/strong> - Motorcycle rides will be our core focus! Long or short. Interstate or out of state. Day trips, over-nighters or weekend runs. QUEST! will also participate in some motorcycle rallies as a group. (Americade, Laconia, Roar to the Shore, etc..) With the \u201cofficial\u201d riding season lasting only seven (7) months, only active riders may suggest Meetups. We want you to be an <strong>ACTIVE<\/strong> member of QUEST! After 60 days of inactivity, riders whom have not participated in a ride will be removed indefinitely from the Meetup. <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><strong>I\u2019m not so interested in the number of riders whom join QUEST! as I am with building a great motorcycle riding collective<\/strong><\/span><strong>!<\/strong> Join to ride.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Journey<\/strong> \u2013 Launching out before dawn for a leisure ride to Pt. Pleasant, NJ for a day at the beach. Riding to Central Park Summer Stage to lounge on the Great Lawn to watch a free concert. Exploring twisties in the Catskills &amp; Adirondack Mountains of NY State. Riding through Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania &amp; Delaware Water Gap. From Springtime motorcycle maintenance opportunities where a certified motorcycle mechanic will be available to answer questions about your bike to Summertime rides for Maine Lobster and Philly Cheese Steaks in Philadelphia, to Fall foliage runs...the journey begins with QUEST!<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Return<\/strong> \u2013 If you ride you know that visiting places by motorcycle is better than seeing them from the inside of an automobile. The freedom that motorcycling offers is like nothing else. The wind. The sounds. The scents. The open road. After a long day of riding we\u2019ll pause to gather our thoughts of the day and bid farewells. Each ride is expected to offer something new. Every return home to our families and loved ones is a successful ride. Come on out and join QUEST! As a QUEST! rider you will be more than just a rider. As adults we all have various experiences &amp; talents which may lend themselves to a better\u00a0QUEST! experience.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>QUEST! Motorcycle Group is built upon 5 Core Principles:<\/p>\n<p><strong>A) Individual Respect &amp; Integrity \u2013 If these 2 principles need\u00a0explaining then QUEST! isn\u2019t for you.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>B) Personal Safety \u2013 Assuring that your Motorcycle is in good working order and you're wearing proper motorcycling gear, equipment and that all your NYS DMV papers are current and in order. This not only protects you as a rider, but your fellow Quest! riders and other travelers on the road.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>C) Responsible Ridership - YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN ACTIONS &amp; BY REQUESTING TO JOIN QUEST! MOTORCYCLERS, UPON APPROVAL YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS THEREIN! \u00a0YOU RIDE AT YOUR OWN RISK! \u00a0QUEST! MOTORCYCLERS NOR ITS LEADERSHIP TEAM ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU'RE HURT BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER PARTICIPATING ON A RIDE. \u00a0 RECKLESSNESS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED DURING A RIDE. \u00a0IF IT IS NOTICED THAT YOU ARE CAUSING A HAZARD TO OTHER QUEST! RIDERS YOU WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE! \u00a0NO EXCEPTIONS!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>D) TeamWork &amp; Good Sportsmanship - No one rider\/member is bigger than the collective Group. Period!\u00a0 We are a team!\u00a0 We are one.\u00a0 No one gets left behind.\u00a0 We ride for fun! That's what the QUEST! experience is all about!\u00a0 Let's enjoy the QUEST!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>E) Respect For The Ride - Ride &amp; Have A Great Time!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In sum, my endeavor in creating QUEST! is that each journey impact member lives positively. Have you ever heard the saying \u201cRide to Live, Live to Ride\"? I believe every person may be at different places in their lives where anything can impact them richly or meagerly. With this new Meetup I hope riders who join will enrich my life &amp; yours\u2026but only if we\u2019re courageous enough to allow ourselves to truly embrace\u2026 the QUEST!<\/p>","lon":-73.7399978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/9\/2\/highres_97997042.jpeg","photo_id":97997042,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/9\/2\/600_97997042.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/9\/2\/thumb_97997042.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":120705822,"name":"winston"},"members":227,"name":"QUEST!

I'm using the vast amount of Japanese pubs in the NYC area to recreate typical nights in Tokyo. Whats better then taking a couple hours to share some drinks and Japanese small plates and forget about the outside world with a good group? Maybe after we can belt out some tunes at a Karaoke house, or play some billiards, or go to another Izakaya?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : medium\">Also, this group has become very diverse in the events we hold. Outside of weekly happy hours and weekend Izakaya hang outs we have participated in a wide variety of other cool, Japanese-centric things. Some of the events we have attended include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Japan Block Fair<\/li>\n<li>Concerts (Japanese)<\/li>\n<li>Ramen Contests<\/li>\n<li>Sake\/Shochu Tastings<\/li>\n<li>Japanese food fairs and tasting events.<\/li>\n<li>Trips to the Japanese market.<\/li>\n<li>Other Asian restaurants.<\/li>\n<li>Izakaya crawls.<\/li>\n<li>Asian film festivals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>\"Is this a Japanese food club?\"<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No not exactly. Actually in Izakayas the spirits get the spot light. The food is complimentary to the sake, shochu, and beer. That doesn't mean you need to be a raging alcoholic to join. I myself am not a big drinker. But this is a pub based group. Still Japanese food lovers should do OK with this group too as we have visited many Japanese restaurants. I also like to include some nightlife when the group is not ready to go home. Its not unusual to end up singing karaoke, shooting pool, or finding a roof top bar and enjoy the view.<\/p>\n<p>I hope this explains the group.

The Deeksha brings about a growth in consciousness, thus heightening your life experience. The Deeksha changes emotions and perceptions or helps one be free of perceptions. This shift changes one\u2019s approach to challenges and opportunities since when perceptions change one no more perceives a problem as a problem. When perceptions change reality may also change because the external world is merely a reflection of the inner world. Higher perceptions and positive emotions create a more successful and fulfilling life.<\/p>\n<p>Effort does have a role in the Deeksha. While effort in the form of introspection, contemplation, asking the right question, having an intent, external doing etc. is also essential. The role of effort in this context is analogous to a plane speeding on a runway to take off, but the actual take-off also demands an appropriate wind current. The Deeksha is like the current that finally lifts the plane off the ground.<\/p>\n<p>Deeksha is given by the laying hands on the recipient\u2019s head or sometimes through intent. In this case, the giver holds the receiver in his or her awareness for a few minutes and allows the Deeksha to flow. In this way, the Deeksha can be given at a distance of thousands of miles or to a large group of people all at the same time. Deeksha unfolds differently in every individual as it depends on what the receiver may need it most.<\/p>\n<p>These are some of the common benefits in receiving a Deeksha as reported by the recipients. One can experience greater effects of it with prolonged exposure.<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 Awakens creative potentials, abilities and intelligence <br> \u00b7 Increases ability to learn <br> \u00b7 Resolves inner conflict leading to inner peace and harmony <br> \u00b7 Brings love to relationships <br> \u00b7 Heals emotional hurts and reduces thought burden <br> \u00b7 Evokes affection, friendship and a sense of connectedness with the other. <br> \u00b7 Awakens compassion <br> \u00b7 Infuses vitality <br> \u00b7 Heals the body by healing the mind <br> \u00b7 Relaxes the body and relieves stress <br> \u00b7 Helps build love and appreciation for the body <br> \u00b7 Invokes auspicious energies <br> \u00b7 Removes blocks that hinder success <br> \u00b7 Makes possible a mental frame for abundance <br> \u00b7 Initiates a journey into experiencing unconditional love and joy <br> .

This is achieved by the process of the Oneness Deeksha \/Oneness Blessing which is a phenomenon sourced in the deep passion and the intent of Sri Amma &amp; Sri Bhagavan. <br><\/p>\n<p>Oneness Deeksha (aka) Deeksha is an energy transfer that brings about growth in consciousness. The level of consciousness of a person determines his\/her quality of life experience. For instance, one\u2019s experience of the ongoing recession, the ability to handle misunderstanding in relationship or a daughter\u2019s rebellious nature, what emotions surge through when diagnosed with a health problem, the level of connection with people around and the joy experienced, the intensity of passion at work etc., depend on one\u2019s level of consciousness. As consciousness rises, there is greater awareness, joy, love, togetherness, and focus in everything that you do and experience. <br><\/p>\n<p>The Deeksha neither requires practicing a particular way of living nor is an initiation into following a new path. It does not bind one to any philosophy or ideology. It transcends religious and cultural barriers from the fact that it only chooses to awaken each to his\/her own spiritual tradition by facilitating a neuro-biological shift, thus making religion a matter of personal choice and convenience. Hence people belonging to any faith or age group can receive the Deeksha.<\/p>\n<p>The Oneness Deeksha or Oneness Blessing can be received in person as a hands on the head energy transfer, it can be received in a chat session, via a video webcast, or even over the phone.<b> <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Group History<\/b>:&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>This group was NYC Stress Reduction &amp; Abundance Meditation Group<\/p>\n<p>This group was originally started by Rosario Mazer (Awakened Oneness Trainer) and&nbsp;Vera L.

Helping with cowork spaces is a good start.<\/p>\n<p><span><span>Past &amp; Present:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>New Jersey is the home of Thomas Edison, Bell Labs and was the epicenter of the Pharmaceutical industry and Telco. We also have a highly educated population, great businesses, close proximity to NYC and\/or Philly and a well-developed educational system. However, if you look at lists of top states for entrepreneurship and innovation New Jersey never makes it. The great thing is that this is showing signs of changing. NJ Tech, Jersey Shore Tech and Princeton Tech have proven, by their stellar growth, that New Jersey wants\/needs an entrepreneurial ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p><span><span>LaunchNJ (Not for profit):<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Madison Tech has pivoted and is now called LaunchNJ. Our sole mission is the creation of an entrepreneurial community in New Jersey. This group is run by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs so we figured it only made sense to run it like a startup. We will take chances, measure results and iterate or pivot as needed.<\/p>\n<p><span><span>MVP:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Use the voice of LaunchNJ to support the creation of Special Interest Groups (SIG\u2019s): (i.e. Life Sciences, Developers, Female Entrepreneurs)<\/p>\n<p>Create events that provide high value for entrepreneurs: (workshops, deep dives, co-founder date night etc.)<\/p>\n<p>Make members aware of events occurring around the state (aggregate)<\/p>\n<p>Celebrate New Jersey company wins =\u2019s create buzz<\/p>\n<p><span><span>The Bottom Line:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>New Jersey has all the building blocks necessary to build an entrepreneurial and innovation hub, the movement has started. Since this is a grassroots movement we need you. None of the organizers are getting paid but they are working hard to deliver high impact programs and will continue to do so. However, if we are to succeed we need your help. Please let other entrepreneurs or entrepreneurial people know about the group. It is a great opportunity for them to learn and you are helping your community.<\/p>\n<p><span><span>Definitions:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Entrepreneurial:<\/em> A person who sees a problem and fixes it without having to be told and is willing to share knowledge with others.<\/p>\n<p><em>Entrepreneur<\/em>: An Entrepreneurial Person who chooses to take the plunge and commit themselves 100% to something that has a high probability of failing.<\/p>","lon":-74.2200012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/f\/5\/9\/highres_431724409.jpeg","photo_id":431724409,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/f\/5\/9\/600_431724409.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/f\/5\/9\/thumb_431724409.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13609772,"name":"Carlos Abad"},"members":384,"name":"LaunchNJ: Montclair Tech and Media Startups","id":3359272,"state":"NJ","urlname":"LaunchNJ-Montclair-Tech-and-Media-Startups","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Entrepreneurs & Techies"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1330143192000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"millionaire","name":"Millionaire","id":10424},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Zorkas-Mentors\/","rating":5,"description":"<p><b>Welcome!

A Meetup is where real-life connections and freindships can be formed and harnessed. A Meetup is where the church can practice being the disciple and image of Christ. A Meetup is a great place to introduce people outside the church to Jesus. A Meetup is an opportunity to be active participants in the church<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>PILLARS OF A GTT MEETUP<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Meetups should look different from group to group, but here are four things that should be common umong all groups: Prayer, Worship, Reflection\/Repentence, Hospitality,<\/p>\n<p>Scripture Prayer - Prayer is a staple and common attribute of Meetups because we want to give every person in our church the opportunity to be prayed and to pray for others on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p>Worship - Worship is fun. Sometimes it's singing songs or reading poems, sometimes its visiting sick people. But some kind of worship act, that puts Christ at the center of activity, is always the goal at a meetup.<\/p>\n<p>Reflection\/Repentence - We spend time pointing out God in life, we reflect on His impact on our lives and we consider how we can point our attention, actions and intentions more in step with what God is doing.<\/p>\n<p>Hospitality - An open door and a shared meal goes a long way. A meetup is not a mooch group, it's a communal effort. It's important that members of these groups bring something to offer and are offered something as well. This facilitates a communal ownership and great openess amung members.<\/p>\n<p>Scripture - A meetup is a place that honors scripture and uses it as a starting point for discussions, debate, worship and all other pillars of the gatherings.<\/p>\n<p>HOW LONG IS A MEETUP GROUP Meetup groups should last around the same time that any casual gathering would - around an hour to an hour and a half. This isn't a long service, it's a brief get-together. It's important to keep meetings short so that they are not a big burden on time.

If you have section hiked the AT in the past or even better if you have thru-hiked the trail we would be most pleased to have you in our group.

We can have more responsive services and lower cost without the web of politics, corruption and confusion that we have today.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>Curb Corporate Spending<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n Require corporations to obtain specific permission from shareholders prior to making any spending to influence legislation, elections, or public opinion and impose a 200% tax on such expenditures, which would fund Fair &amp; Clean Elections.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>Open &amp; Honest<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n Require full disclosure of funding sources for all political communications. Impose criminal penalties on corporations that make factual misrepresentations in any communications intended to influence legislation, elections, or public opinion concerning government policy.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>Legislative Reform<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n Establish a full-time, unicameral legislature with 60 representatives, who would each be paid $95,000 a year, prohibited from receiving additional earned income and subject to strict conflict of interest rules.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>Government Efficiency<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n Evaluate local government consolidation, such as unifying police and other law enforcement services in a centralized administration to eliminate excess administration and duplication of services. Create a statewide system of free public schools for every child from the age of three to a college degree.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>Polluters Pay<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n Require corporations to rectify environmental damage on property they own or owned and lobby to reestablish the federal Superfund petrochemical industry tax system.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>Resign to Run<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n Stop politicians from using one elected office as a stepping stone to another, wasting your tax dollars and failing to do their job. Any elected official should be required to resign if he or she wants to seek election to another job.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>No Double Dipping<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n Public officials should be barred from holding two or more jobs at taxpayer expense.

In August of 2012, We decided to be better.<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n We have a growing group of diverse individuals who like to help each other with issues we are faced with no matter what stage of the divorce process you are in - We welcome anyone who is contemplating, in or have completed the divorce process. We offer Compassion, Friendship and Fellowship and encourage new members to attend any gathering that you want to attend. You may attend any event that you feel like attending, We strongly encourage every member to attend the Monthly Support Meeting at least once.<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n You will be warmly welcomed When you attend your first meeting, event or outing there is nothing to be nervous about. Depending where you are in the divorce process, you will meet someone, with a compassionate ear and who has been in similar situations in which you find yourself today.<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n The Monthly Support Meeting usually last for two hours and your only cost is whatever you decide to eat or drink but you are not required. You don't have to talk much either all we ask is that you introduce yourself to the group and let us know what stage you are in the divorce process and what you would like to get out of our meetings.<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n You will find that you will make lots of new friends who totally \"get\" what you are going thru and you can feel free to ask the group anything you want and see if anyone has an answer or an opinion.<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<\/span><\/p>","lon":-74.2900009155,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/4\/4\/highres_149108772.jpeg","photo_id":149108772,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/4\/4\/600_149108772.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/4\/4\/thumb_149108772.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11202555,"name":"Stephen"},"members":1027,"name":"New Jersey Complete Divorce Support Group","id":3495402,"state":"NJ","urlname":"CompleteDivorceSupport","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.5600013733,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1332078929000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"esl","name":"English as a Second Language","id":182},{"urlkey":"anime","name":"Anime","id":286},{"urlkey":"jpop","name":"Japanese Pop","id":508},{"urlkey":"sushi","name":"Sushi","id":675},{"urlkey":"karaoke","name":"Karaoke","id":1193},{"urlkey":"expatjapanese","name":"Expat Japanese","id":9998},{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"japanese-language","name":"Japanese Language","id":25544},{"urlkey":"japanese-food","name":"Japanese Food","id":25545},{"urlkey":"language-exchange","name":"Language Exchange","id":26212},{"urlkey":"japanese-culture","name":"Japanese Culture","id":30366},{"urlkey":"culture-exchange","name":"Culture Exchange","id":67622}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/JKaraoke\/","rating":4.92,"description":"<p style=\"text-align : left\"><strong><span style=\"font-size : medium\">This group has been created to bring people together that love to sing in both Japanese and English<\/span><\/strong> <strong><span style=\"font-size : medium\">to do Karaoke around New York City.\u00a0 Occasionally, we go to other music and cultural events, such as festivals, street fairs, concerts, etc.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\"><strong><span style=\"color : #800000\"><span style=\"color : #ae3333 ;

It shapes the entire world that one knows. Through subtracting method\u00a0 the Universe mind will remain. This mind is always at peace regardless of conditions. It is the mind where there is no more ups and downs.<\/p>\n<p>Become free of the limitations imposed by the past. These pictures dictate thoughts, emotions, desires, behaviors and health.

By subtracting the human mind with the subtraction method of meditation , people can remove the source of all disturbances. Even one's body will become healthier through practice since stress and other emotions cause so many health problems.<\/p>\n<p>People live according to what they have in their minds. Through subtraction one's mind will change to the Universe mind and always follow the flow of nature. People will come to clearly know meaning and purpose in living.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone from any background is warmly welcomed. Come to know Truth directly from within without any reference to what one has found or been told in the past.

When the human mind changes to the Universe mind it is born again and never dies.<\/p>\n<p>--- What People Say About the Meditation ---<\/p>\n<p>\"Throughout my entire life I always felt like there was something missing. So I kept adding more and became stressed, but this method of subtraction \u00a0was just the opposite. Instead of adding, the meditation provided a simple method of subtraction. After subtracting my past I began to change my mind; how I viewed the world. The method of subtraction allowed me to get rid of my 'self' and my self-centered mind which controlled my speech, thought, and action. Meditation with subtraction method allows me to live freely, without judgment and with gratitude.\" - Ben \/ Foster City, CA<\/p>\n<p>\"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meditationusa.org\/\">Meditation<\/a> of subtraction method\u00a0transcends the boundaries of all religions. It will elevate the human mind to the highest level of existence; the level of divinity. That is where peace is; the element that is meant to control the universe. Once we achieve a permanent peace, we can give it to others.\" -Dr. Charles Marcieca \/ International Association of Educators for World Peace.

We have one mission: Unite startups to propel growth through collaboration. Successful startups almost always have one thing in common- they were able to talk to the right people and work with the right people. Through cultivating various key relationships and strategic alliances they were able to turn their idea into a reality. We are looking for all types of people- entrepreneurs, techies, creatives, socially conscious, non-profits etc. but everyone will have one thing in common which is the pursuit of their start up. Additionally, we don\u2019t want all start ups but rather the ones who are really committed to the idea of collaboration and building a community with a high caliber of people. When you walk in our doors you should be able to really feel the energy. Our goal is to get great people in the space to foster that environment and serve as a business incubator.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #272727 ; font-size : large\"><strong>The Action<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #272727 ; font-size : large\"><strong><br>\n\n<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #272727 ; font-size : medium\"><strong>At United Upstarts:<\/strong> we\u2019re going to take coworking one step further and actually focus specifically on Startups with an emphasis on how the community can help each other grow their businesses. Coworking naturally helps with this process because it encourages the exchange of ideas and sharing of resources. We will enhance this by hosting networking events, holding meetings to engage our members, and connecting our members with people who can help them expand their business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #272727 ; font-size : medium\"><strong>Prior to getting the space:<\/strong> we will start off by meeting at a coffee shop in NYC at least once a week (if not more) to share ideas, give input for the actual space, connect with fellow Upstarters, and find exciting entrepreneurial events to visit. We will also hold a weekly event simply to relax and unwind with our fellow coworkers over a few drinks. Our goal is to create an awesome coworking community before we actually open shop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #272727 ; font-size : medium\"><strong>Future Coworking Center:<\/strong> We\u2019re shooting to open the center in the next 2 months (or so) when we are able to generate enough interest.

And we are so very sorry to anyone reading this who has lost a love. &nbsp;This club is specifically only for those who had a committed relationship where you lived together under the same roof. We say this so specifically because we have found those of us who lost that kind of partner have a special set of grief and loss issues that we need help to get through. We best help ourselves by sharing our feelings and social time with others in that specific category. We meet to help each other regain our lives again and the joy, happiness and equanimity we all deserve and can find. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>\u201cThere is a secret to getting through&nbsp;grief, loss and pain. If we are alone we can't see who we are. When we join a Grief Club, other people become&nbsp;the mirror. Through them, we see ourselves and gain an understanding of what we are going through. Then slowly, real slowly, we learn to accept who we see<\/em><\/strong> <span><strong><em>in the mirror. Then you become the mirror for them. By being honest about who you are, you help them learn to love and accept themselves.\u201d<\/em><\/strong> <em>From The Grief Club: the secret to getting through all kinds of change By Melody Beattie; 2006; ISBN # 1592853498<\/em><\/span> <br> <span>9781592853496<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The organizers of this Club - The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow - and our active members who take part in our gatherings&nbsp;<span>have discovered that j<\/span><span>oining a grief club and being active in it is the best thing you can do to help yourself and to continue to help the rest of us. T<\/span>he single biggest tendency of those who have lost a great love and life partner is to isolate themselves. In isolating we try to be strong and busy and simply continue with our life without truly grieving the loss first or voicing our current feelings. These strategies are ineffective and keep us in a depressing downward cycle for too long.<\/p>\n<p>An important difference in our club and many other Meetup clubs is this: we are NOT a dating club or website. Our goal is not to introduce you to future life partners or dates (although this can and does happen and we are happy when people find each other because they are members of this Club.) But, &nbsp;we are not a way to find a mate and we caution each member to please NOT use this club simply to find a date. This is upsetting to many members whose grief is so raw and whose need is to remember and grieve their loss - not to move on to dating and the suggestion they should forget their partner. Everyone needs to move into dating on their own terms and time. Club gatherings are not the place to work this through. You are of course welcome to write to members and ask them out for coffee or a date. But please do it in a respectful and delicate manner that our common situations require. It is important to understand that we discourage discussion of dating at meetings<\/p>\n<p><span><span>Unfortunately a lot of relatives and friends and acquaintances will support you in your tendency to isolate and to keep busy to forget your grief, but we in this Club will encourage you to join with us in finding ways to get out the grief and also rebuild joy. We do this in the simple act of getting together often to share our feelings, stories and tears and to socialize. Doing things with other W's brings us such relief that someone finally wants to listen and share.<\/span>We need to do this together. It cannot be done alone - contrary to what people out there try to tell you. We do not believe that \"Everyone Goes Through Grief In Their Own Way\" . We organizers&nbsp;believe we all have shockingly similar experiences as W's and this helps us understand that by joining together we can go through grief in a new and healing manner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>When&nbsp;you get together with us in this club on Skype or in person, you will be amazed to find new hope and happiness and joy and connection&nbsp;like a window shade letting in the sunlight in the morning of our new life. It will be morning and not mourning for you after that. It may not happen at your first meeting but it will begin. And by the third or fourth or fifth consecutive weekly meeting - especially if you help create the meeting - you will be singing a new song and feeling that sunlight permeating your life. We have support meetings run as talking circles in person or by Skype and also social meetings where we spend a Sunday afternoon or evening together in Manhattan. We also have a \"Pages\" section on our Home page with readings on ways to grieve and rebuild.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The loss of a life partner continues to affect us for years and we need each other to find out ways to grieve, rebuild and find new joy in our new lives.&nbsp;<span>We &nbsp;have members who lost a partner last week , last month, last year and also those whose loss happened many years ago. When you know other W's, you can&nbsp;exchange guidance on what is working for each of&nbsp;you to get us all through the most trying experience of our lifetime. Take a look at our \"Group reviews\" on the Home Page under \"About us\"&nbsp;to find out what members have to say about us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The simple act of joining together - in person - on a weekly basis - with others who understand your experience WILL help you - it WILL begin and continue to heal you.&nbsp; In our meetings there will be people who lost a love one month ago and also those whose partners have been gone many years. Even though some of us have remarried or found a new love, we still come to meetings to deal with even that part of this journey. Our lives are never the same after loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to find what some call \"safe\" people to express our feelings and emotions to.&nbsp;\"Safe\" people are those who have had our experience and therefore empathize but&nbsp;do not pity&nbsp;us.&nbsp;Safe people know how to listen to us.<\/p>\n<p><span>The three main organizers of this club who have kept it going since its beginning in 2008 have a total of&nbsp;30 years of widowhood behind us. When we make statements about what might benefit the members, we know whereof we speak. These three people - Annie, Marvin, and&nbsp;Regina&nbsp;&nbsp;- have&nbsp;worked for years to find help for the members and ourselves. We have found answers to the agony we were in ourselves before we found the fellowship in this Club. Each of us would be happy to talk more personally to you about this new joy we have found.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Please go ahead and join! We have asked that you answer four questions just so we can feel a sense of connection to you and then all you do is push the join button. Once our organizers have reviewed your profile we will make the decision of whether you should join us. The only people who cannot join this club are those who have lost a family member or friend who was not a spouse or partner, because we know there are other clubs for them. One Club we are happy to recommend is Life After Death run by our co-organizer, Taruni&nbsp;at Meetup.com.<\/p>\n<p>Once we have approved your membership, please go to the Home Page often and RSVP for a scheduled event. Better yet - go there and schedule your own announcement that you are meeting on the corner of _ and _ on Friday evening to go to a play, a movie or to sit in a wonderful restaurant together. &nbsp;We'd especially love it if you would offer your private, quiet space for a circle of sharing. We look forward to meeting you, hearing your story and sharing ours with you.<\/p>\n<p>Best wishes from your Organizers: Regina, Annie and Marvin<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/e\/b\/8\/highres_421420632.jpeg","photo_id":421420632,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/e\/b\/8\/600_421420632.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/e\/b\/8\/thumb_421420632.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":2974964,"name":"Regina"},"members":157,"name":"The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow","id":3761882,"state":"NY","urlname":"The-Sun-Will-Come-Out-Tomorrow","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Stamford","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1335707118000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"mindfulness","name":"Mindfulness","id":15920},{"urlkey":"mindfulness-in-nature","name":"Mindfulness in Nature","id":33007},{"urlkey":"chakras-kundalini","name":"Chakras & Kundalini","id":71244},{"urlkey":"living-in-the-present-moment","name":"Living in the Present Moment","id":110539},{"urlkey":"rockin-meditation-for-relaxation","name":"Rockin Meditation for Relaxation","id":956902}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rockin-Meditation\/","rating":4.96,"description":"<p><span><em><span><strong>Rockin' Meditation<\/strong><\/span><\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Come Discover How Music Calms the Savage Mind!<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Meditation brings clarity and peace to your mind.

I used to meet and connect with people really strongly from activities at a gym, or playing a team sport. So let's try that! I'd like to meet a bunch of people working on cool projects\/companies, and play a fun and not overly-competitive sport together. While the intros we make at the beginning will spark interest in each other, it'll be the game play that actually create some kinships and a sense of communicating and working together. Not to mention we'd be getting exercise as opposed to the folks just meeting at the bar!

The Par 3 Club is for golfers - and beginners - who want to enjoy the game playing at NYCs Par-3 golf courses or driving ranges (for example: Flushing Meadows Park &amp; Randall\u2019s Island). Our Rules: 1. Be friendly, courteous and encouraging to other members. 2. Obey the rules of the course. 3. Pay for your own golf course fee, food, golf balls or club rentals (if you do not have your own). 4. If you RSVP \u201cyes\u201d please be on time. 5. Have fun! Events with more than 4 participants will need to break up into smaller groups (most courses have a 4-player per group maximum.) The average round of Par-3 golf takes between 2 and 3 hours. For events at the driving range, stay as long as you like. Join us for a fun summer with new friends, green grass, trees and birdies - bogeys are okay, too!

Our mission is to attract, educate, organize, and mobilize our fellow citizens to secure public policy consistent with our three core values of Fiscal Responsibility, Constitutionally Limited Government and Free Markets.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Core Values<\/strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n Fiscal Responsibility<br>\n\n Constitutionally Limited Government<br>\n\n Free Markets<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Fiscal Responsibility:<\/strong> Fiscal Responsibility by government honors and respects the freedom of the individual to spend the money that is the fruit of their own labor. A constitutionally limited government, designed to protect the blessings of liberty, must be fiscally responsible or it must subject its citizenry to high levels of taxation that unjustly restrict the liberty our Constitution was designed to protect. Such runaway deficit spending as we now see in Washington D.C. compels us to take action as the increasing national debt is a grave threat to our national sovereignty and the personal and economic liberty of future generations.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Constitutionally Limited Government:<\/strong> We, the members of The Tea Party Patriots, are inspired by our founding documents and regard the Constitution of the United States to be the supreme law of the land. We believe that it is possible to know the original intent of the government our founders set forth, and stand in support of that intent. Like the founders, we support states' rights for those powers not expressly stated in the Constitution. As the government is of the people, by the people and for the people, in all other matters we support the personal liberty of the individual, within the rule of law.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Free Markets:<\/strong> A free market is the economic consequence of personal liberty.

When we let go of our individual focus, we are able to experience the dynamics of life to a much greater extent. This allows us to move beyond the interpretation (understanding) of humans as objects in the physical world and thus experience humans from within.\u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n If we recognise that rather than meeting people, we encounter realities in which these people emerge, based on what they believe and defend, we develop a deeper compassion and understanding. We are aware that in this world we all wear a false smile.\u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Once we begin to comprehend the inner experiences of others, and to create through our being, we make a quantum leap in our communication. We lift communication up to the next level of evolution. This helps us to acknowledge the true cause of many conflicts, looking beyond the symptoms to the root of the problem.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Transparent Communication is a way of life in which different levels of consciousness as well as different levels of development and intelligence are included. It requires of us that we engage in an experientially oriented exploration of life. Only then will we truly learn to comprehend the world as a form of exchange in which we share a common space of interaction and learn to recognize the cosmic addresses of conscious content. We are in direct relationship rather than being distracted by symptoms. A high degree of interpersonal clarity is thus achieved, supporting our authentic expression, not to mention an expansion of the collective intelligence.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n This is the basis for a Higher WE.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.thomashuebl.com\/<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/3\/0\/0\/highres_239377632.jpeg","photo_id":239377632,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/3\/0\/0\/600_239377632.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/3\/0\/0\/thumb_239377632.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7706568,"name":"Robert Brugger"},"members":99,"name":"Transparent Communication NYC","id":4105292,"state":"NY","urlname":"TCPNYC","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Practitioners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1340068341000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"gaypros","name":"Gay Professionals","id":4270},{"urlkey":"gay-men","name":"Gay Men","id":19558},{"urlkey":"gay-male-social-group","name":"Gay Male Social Group","id":55541},{"urlkey":"gay-mens-fitness","name":"Gay Mens Fitness","id":99285},{"urlkey":"gay-men-over-40","name":"Gay Men Over 40","id":172590}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Gay-Mens-Hiking-Group\/","rating":4.9,"description":"<p>Are you a gay man over 40 who loves to hike?

I am a Board Certified Coach and Spiritual Life Coach. \u00a0My coaching practice is located in Fanwood NJ.

My name is Steven Bellafiore, and I am the founder of the Business Networking Organization called Simply Referrals! After a 7 year run on the American Stock Exchange as a floor trader, I wanted to broaden my horizons by creating an organization where professionals could meet in a fun, relaxed atmosphere that fostered the sharing of ideas, strategies and referrals. I tried other networking groups but always left feeling disappointed and frustrated because the structure they offered was never quite in-line with my vision of what a business networking group should be. So in 2007, I started Simply Referrals, a brand new concept in business networking, not based on fees and lengthy contracts or bylaws. You cannot buy your place in Simply Referrals it must be earned by attending meetings and contributing to the overall success of the group. Everyone has a stake and a voice; as well as, a GREAT opportunity to make real connections with other businesses. All memberships are category exclusive within each chapter, which increases the potential for referrals as opposed to other networking groups. There is no membership fee to join Simply Referrals! As a Simply Referrals member you will not only have the opportunity to grow your business at our networking events, but also by using the services of our S.R. Web Team that handle our Facebook &amp; Twitter accounts, and each S.R. chapters blog. Each Simply Referrals Chapter has its own website and blog. By simply emailing info@simplyreferrals.net you can have informative information posted to the Simply Referrals Blog, Facebook &amp; Twitter accounts, which will help increase your businesses Internet exposure. Our S.R.Web Team also posts weekly Internet advertisements to help continue to increase the overall membership growth of Simply Referrals, as well as announcements for any Simply Referrals event. The meetings are set-up to be fun, friendly, and stress-free! Everyone has a chance to pitch their business and everyone has a chance to voice their opinions or share their experiences with the group. We all understand that sometimes life and business doesn\u2019t always follow the schedules we lay out; however, you will find that Simply Referrals will quickly move to the top of your priority list when you meet the other members and become involved in the conversation. For more information, please contact either myself or the leader of your local chapter! stevenbellafiore@yahoo.com info@simplyreferrals.net www.simplyreferrals.net .<\/p>","lon":-73.5199966431,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/9\/f\/c\/highres_136347132.jpeg","photo_id":136347132,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/9\/f\/c\/600_136347132.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/9\/f\/c\/thumb_136347132.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12896638,"name":"Raina Bellafiore"},"members":115,"name":"Simply Referrals Levittown, NY Business Networking Group","id":4246312,"state":"NY","urlname":"Simply-Referrals-Levittown-NY-Business-Networking-Group","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"West Orange","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1341601249000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"salsa","name":"Salsa","id":1122},{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"couples","name":"Couples","id":3250},{"urlkey":"ballroomdance","name":"Ballroom Dancing","id":3998},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"cruising","name":"Cruises","id":19056},{"urlkey":"dance-lessons","name":"Dance Lessons","id":19146},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"weekend-getaways","name":"Weekend Getaways","id":28784}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Dances-The-Manor-Dome-Nightclub-West-Orange\/","rating":4.03,"description":"<p>To create settings where participants can make new friends.<\/p>","lon":-74.2600021362,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/b\/3\/highres_441497843.jpeg","photo_id":441497843,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/b\/3\/600_441497843.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/b\/3\/thumb_441497843.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":53809112,"name":"Ralph A.

You'll open up a world of new possibilities: giving better work presentations; leading meetings - and participating in them - more confidently; speaking more smoothly off the cuff; even handling one-on-one interactions with family, friends and colleagues more positively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/0\/9\/e\/event_151317502.jpeg\" width=\"90\" height=\"57\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left\"><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Visit our website:<\/strong> <span style=\"color : #0000ff\"><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/7487.toastmastersclubs.org\/\">http:\/\/7487.toastmastersclubs.org\/<\/a><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/9\/0\/2\/event_150926882.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left\"><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Visit our YouTube channel:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/NutleyToastmasters\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/NutleyToastmasters<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><br>\n\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/5\/a\/event_150927482.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left\"><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Visit our Facebook FanPage:<\/strong> <span style=\"color : #3366ff\"><strong>https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/NutleyToastmastersClub<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>Come and join us and have some FUN while improving your communications skills!<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong><br>\n\n<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-74.1600036621,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/9\/5\/c\/highres_142667452.jpeg","photo_id":142667452,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/9\/5\/c\/600_142667452.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/9\/5\/c\/thumb_142667452.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":28392712,"name":"Anthony Raimondo, Ph.

They all emphasize love as being the foundation of life. Are they talking intimate love or did romance somehow hijack the true nature of love? Everybody sings about it, talks about it, and writes about it - but what does love really mean and how can it help you live a better life and create a better world? This meetup is a philosophical exploration of the practical side of love - what does it mean to cultivate true love for yourself, other people, and our planet. Love isn't just a fuzzy concept that dating sites talk about. It's the fundamental motive force behind humanity. Every person wants to be loved and do what they love. Every great accomplishment is the product of people doing what they love. Each meetup is a guided discussion around a particular facet of love, be it compassion, service, forgiveness, kindness, following your heart, etc. We will explore how to apply ancient wisdom to modern human living. This group is open to all.
