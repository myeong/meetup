This will be a slower paced, mini-version of the paddle we did then.<\/p> <p><br\/>Finish off the weekend is style with this CKA laid back social paddle.\u00a0 Bring a snack for yourself and perhaps something to share with the group\u00a0for a break at\u00a0about midpoint in the paddle.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>This will be an relatively easy, approximately 7 to 8 mile laid back Sunday paddle which should have us off the water by 6:00-ish. \u00a0Lots of members like to bring a snack to share with the group during our social stop off the water at the mid point in the paddle but you shouldn't feel obligated to do so.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We'll be launching from the\u00a0the soft launch at Solley Cove Park promptly at 2:30 PM.\u00a0 The soft launch at Solley Cove Park is yet another result of the efforts of the Anne Arundel Public Water Access Committee. \u00a0Finding this launch site is a little tricky. \u00a0It's at the end of a dirt road by the Curtis Bay American Legion. Follow the signs for the American Legion and the paintball park.<\/p> <p>Solley Cove is located on Marley Creek which flows in to the south side of the Baltimore Harbor just west of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in an area known as Curtis Bay.<\/p> <p>Plan to arrive with plenty of time to have your boat and gear ready to be on the water by then.<\/p> <p>There are rental kayaks available for this paddle at\u00a0special weekend price of $45.00. Please answer the rental question when you RSVP to request one.<\/p>",

Rueda de Casino. Does that have something to do with gambling? Nope. It\u2019s a dance.<\/p> <p>Originating in Cuba in the 1950s, Rueda de Casino typically consists of multiple couples dancing synchronized moves in a circle, intermixed with frequent partner changes. Rueda is the Spanish word for wheel (dancing in a circle); casino is the Cuban term for the place that you would go to dance: the dance halls, not synonymous with the English definition of casino. No gambling involved!<\/p> <p>We\u2019re already familiar with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sheena.black.12\">Sheena Black<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cuffie.samateh\">Cher Jey<\/a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/oscar.rousseauxpons\">Oscar Rousseaux<\/a>, presenting us with the movements that define what it means to be Afro-Cuban at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/livewellbemore\">The Living Well<\/a>. Let\u2019s continue the momentum by participating in another popular Cuban dance style with those oh-so-familiar Latin beats that we\u2019ve all come to love in salsa\u2026 The music RDCB brings will be like salsa, but with more\u2026 groove. Funk. Sabor!<\/p> <p>What can you expect from a RDCB Party? In a word: vibrancy. This friendly group has dancers of every age, every race, and every ability. Their mission, \u201cto increase awareness, interest, and appreciation of Afro-Cuban music and dance in the Baltimore area and the Latin Dance community.\u201d<\/p> <p>And what if you don\u2019t know the dance? Rueda de Casino Baltimore\u2019s founder, Cedric Teamer, has an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 boasting his skills for bringing Baltimore the best Latin music mix and providing the city with the only Cuban based dance school in this area. RDCB has hosted at various Latin Dance venues in the city. They also regularly host public social events and classes; they\u2019ve even performed at Baltimore\u2019s renown Artscape in 2014, and here at The Living Well this past May. On Sunday, August 30th, at 4PM, Rueda de Casino Baltimore will be at The Living Well once again. A dance class, by casino group Fuakata from New York, will present an hour-long class before open dancing begins and the hottest Son, Songo, Salsa Cubana and Timba will be played by none other than\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/djdola.yorubaontwo\">Dj-dola Yorubaontwo<\/a>(co founder of SalsaUnderground Washington DC) and RDCB's own TIMBA TITAN !Consider yourself taught!<\/p> <p><br\/>Cost for the social is $12<\/p> <p>Like us at:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/rdcbaltimore\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/rdcbaltimore\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/rdcbaltimore<\/a><\/a><\/p>",

Pictures come off the walls, knives move across tables, and glasses break by themselves. There is supposedly a man who regularly appears in the bar area, holding a beer. A daughter of a patron described in detail five ghosts that she saw, including a young girl, about 2 years old. She even said that one ghost had his hand on her parent\u2019s shoulder, trying to get their attention. - See more at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.strangeusa.com\/ViewLocation.aspx?id=4678&amp;Description=_Belmont_Conference_Center__Elkridge__MD#sthash.7AC7db8B.dpuf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.strangeusa.com\/ViewLocation.aspx?id=4678&amp;Description=_Belmont_Conference_Center__Elkridge__MD#sthash.7AC7db8B.dpuf<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Need a deposit put in by June 6 so we need half down by next meeting.<\/b><\/p> <p>They have heard a little girl, a man, a carriage coming up the drive, and several other things. \u00a0There is a cemetery in the back. \u00a0A barn where the horses were buried and much more.<\/p> <p>This one is going to cost a little but I think it will be worth it. \u00a0Remember we are the first paranormal group to go in here. \u00a0$40 in person and $41 by paypal.<\/p> <p>You don't want to miss this one.<\/p> <p>History:<\/p> <p>In 1732, Caleb Dorsey, of Annapolis and Hockley-in-the Hole on the Severn River had purchased the land in which Belmont now resides. Caleb Dorsey\u2019s son had several iron forges on the creeks that fed onto the Patapsco River. A bustling and prosperous port thrived then in Elkridge. One of Dorsey\u2019s sons, also named Caleb, was an avid foxhunter. Once, while tracking a rare gray fox, he found himself in unfamiliar territory, near the home of Priscilla Hill. Their fortuitous meeting resulted in friendship, then marriage. The elder Dorsey gave the land to his son as a wedding present and the younger Caleb built the manor house. On either side of the front door were placed two carved plaques, \u201cCPD 1738\u201d. Caleb and Priscilla had three sons and six daughters. When Caleb died in 1772, his son Edward inherited the property, along with the iron forges and several other tracts of land.<\/p> <p>After Edward died, his headstrong daughter, also named Priscilla, gained ownership of Belmont. Priscilla eloped with Alexander Hanson in 1805. Hanson founded the Federal Republican, a pro British newspaper and he poured money into the endeavor. Hanson\u2019s unpopular views resulted in his being attacked during the war of 1812 and he suffered permanent injuries. In 1815, Priscilla received her inheritance, Edward Dorsey\u2019s property that she would name Belmont.<\/p> <p>After Hanson\u2019s death at the age of 33, Priscilla tried to run the farm, but financial problems beset her and she sold parcels of land in the 1830\u2019s. In 1839, she mortgaged the estate for $1,500. Realizing that her son, Charles, was addicted to horses and gaming, Priscilla stated in her will that if Charles ever compromised the estate, it was to be transferred to his wife and to her family. In 1875, the property went to a sheriff\u2019s auction, where it brought $25. However, because of Priscilla\u2019s foresight, the auction was contested and the property reverted back to Charles\u2019 children in 1879. His daughters Anna Marie and Florence stayed on the property while other siblings moved away.<\/p> <p>In 1917, the property passed to Mary Bowdoin Bruce, a descendant of Caleb and Priscilla Dorsey. Mary and her husband, Howard, restored the estate to its original beauty. Howard Bruce was the vice president and general manager of Bartlett Hayward Company, a small steel factory. His prominence increased during World War I, and he became well respected in the financial and political arenas. During World War II, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his vital contribution to the war production effort.<\/p> <p>Although Belmont remained a working farm, Bruce\u2019s predominant interest was in raising and breeding his stable of thoroughbred horses. He became the owner of the famed Billy Barton, who won numerous races including the Grand National Handicaps and the coveted Maryland Hunt Cup. Billy Barton is buried with full tack on, in an upright position, alongside another one of Bruce\u2019s horses near the time-worn barn. In 1961, after Howard Bruce\u2019s death, the property passed to his cousin David Bruce, the former ambassador to Britain, who in turn gave Belmont to the Smithsonian Institute. The Smithsonian converted Belmont into a conference center, where generals, vice presidents, astronauts and many other notables were able to meet in a quiet and controlled setting.<\/p> <p>In 1983, the 85 acre estate was sold to the American Chemical Society, which continued the tradition of providing excellent hospitality to the world leaders.<\/p> <p>In 2004, Belmont was purchased by Howard Community College. The Community College added hospitality classes to the Belmont experience while continuing the same traditions as the two previous owners.<\/p> <p>On June 21, 2012, Howard County Government purchased Belmont to ensure the stewardship of this beautiful site for the residents of Howard County. When fully operational, Belmont will become a popular venue for executive retreats, corporate trainings, weddings, company picnics and other special events. Environmental, preservation and historical programs will also be major components of the management plan.<\/p>",

FUN!<\/p> <p>However, since each workout program is intentionally different to alleviate boredom and to give you maximum results in minimum time its difficult to describe a \"typical day.\" You can expect some light running, resistance training, obstacle courses, core, body weight, and team training. On some days, you will hike, crawl, lunge, and have a fun time while burning a ton of fat and meeting new people. It's always an adventure! These 1 hour workouts are design to provide a total body workout, in half the time!<\/p> <p>Can wait to see you at the next session!<\/p>",

A pirate\u2019s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\u2019s more to a pirate\u2019s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\u2019s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate\u2019s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\u2019s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.<\/p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that\u2019s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there\u2019s power, there\u2019s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play, as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we are sure we have space for, but if there is more interest, we can almost certainly make more room. So please sign up for the wait list if you want to play.<\/p> <p>3.

Yes, for years, even though our permit was until 10:30 PM, we sometimes played until 11, 11:30 and sometimes even past midnight. Until-a new, nasty custodian turned us in to the Vice Principal, who sent an e-mail to the Rec council who forwarded it to us. We then had to be out of the gym 10:30 PM sharp, NO EXCEPTIONS.
