FEMA, PSE&amp;G and other institutions eventually reached the city to restore basic services. But our telecommunications companies were overwhelmed and unable to respond effectively in the face of unprecedented infrastructure failures. As a result, Hoboken residents and businesses had a very difficult time communicating with each other, with our local government, and with friends and family outside our community. We can't let Hoboken go off the grid like this again. And we can't wait for Verizon or Cablevision to harden their systems. Despite repeated calls from Congress and the Federal Communications Commission, the telecommunications industry is resisting new requirements for backup power for cell sites and other critical communications facilities. We have to fix this problem ourselves so that our community is prepared for the next big crisis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>A new technology called mesh wireless networking offers a fast, relatively inexpensive way to quickly build an open, free, redundant local network in Hoboken.

As many of you have probably experienced, the value-add of most startup events is minimal. The quality of talks and panels is low, but it is even worse when it comes to networking opportunities made available by these events. A chosen few get all the attention while rest of the attendees do nothing more than exchange business cards.\u00a0<span>Our goal is to provide a level playing field to everyone because it is our belief that you learn more from people who are \"in the same boat\" rather than from superstars who have \"been there, done that\".<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We want to bring together entrepreneurs, investors, mentors, providers and others from the startup ecosystem. Together, we will build a community that is completely focused on providing high-value to # STARTUP members. We may restrict access or organize invite-only events (based on member relevance to certain events) to ensure quality of our events and conferences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We are dedicated to building the best startup network in the world.<\/span> But, w<span>e will not grow our network at the expense of diluting value to our members.<\/span> Our long-term mission is to build local chapters that organize events and conferences in every major city across the world.

I found that time and time again, people not knowing how to use the various features of their cameras is what holds back their progress. Spend some time learning how to manually control your camera, it is time well spent. Also do a little planning and prep work before coming to the meetup, it will help you take better pictures. <br><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/f\/600_435361055.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>(Photos above were taken during our Light-painting meetup events in 2014) <br><\/p>\n<p>Some forms of photography require two people or more people working the equipment behind the scenes to effectively pull off a shot such as in the lightpainting shots above. A camera that can be controlled using manual settings and a sturdy tripod are the most basic pieces of equipment you will need for this group. All the photos shown on this page were taken using long exposure and sturdy tripods. (Below - HDR of Eiffel Tower at twilight, using bracketed 2 - 8 second time exposures)<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/5\/6\/event_296060822.jpeg\" height=\"162\" width=\"239\"><\/p>\n<p>Although not required, sometimes, additional equipment is needed such as&nbsp; flashlight(s), flash(s), wireless triggers, etc... for our light painting or off camera flash events (depending what you want to do). <br><\/p>\n<p>Lastly, I really encourage you to learn the software that has changed the way we develop photos. Probably the #1 program that has helped photographers make amazing shots is Adobe Photoshop. If you haven't learned it yet, I suggest you spend some time with this amazing program. I also encourage you to learn Lightroom. There are also many free programs available that one can learn to help achieve the effect you are looking for.<\/p>\n<p>So bring what equipment you have as well as a open mind let's make some cool photos.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a great idea for an unusal photo, either make a comment on the group page or come to our group meeting and let us know, we may choose to make it a group project.<\/p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Experimental-Photography\/pages\/Membership_Policy_and_Liability_Waiver\/\">Click here to see Membership policies<\/a> in order to join.<\/strong><\/p>","lon":-73.9400024414,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/a\/5\/highres_438563205.jpeg","photo_id":438563205,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/a\/5\/600_438563205.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/a\/5\/thumb_438563205.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":4556764,"name":"Patrick"},"members":134,"name":"NYC Experimental Photography","id":10755002,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Experimental-Photography","category":{"name":"photography","id":27,"shortname":"photography"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Experimental Photographers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"members","city":"Hoboken","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1382239179000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"expat","name":"Expat","id":4446},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"movie-nights","name":"Movie Nights","id":15940},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"foodie","name":"Foodie","id":18528},{"urlkey":"hoboken","name":"Hoboken","id":42476}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HIFgroup\/","rating":4.92,"description":"<p>Did you move to Hoboken from another country?

Some even develop PTSD, a serious condition that CAN be treated and even reversed. JOIN THE RESCUE DOG OWNERS SUPPORT GROUP! Monday evenings, from 8-9 PM. 131 West 72nd Street (b\/w Columbus &amp; Broadway), on the 2nd Floor. We get together each week to talk about what's going on with you and your dog. If you don't feel like sharing you can just come and listen. The meetings are beneficial either way. Our members have seen amazing changes in their dogs within just a few weeks. PAY IT FORWARD - HELP OTHERS - HELP YOURSELF - HELP YOUR DOG. No fee for the first meeting. $10 per meeting after that. Meetings are for owners only. Sorry, no dogs.

Our focus is on integrating theoretical models, study design, and statistical analyses to improve assessment and interventions in digital health research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We welcome anyone interested in health outcomes and mechanisms of change.

They also have the option to publish their poems on our website at http:\/\/www.thepoetrytable.com.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span><br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>","lon":-74.0100021362,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/1\/0\/a\/highres_422424842.jpeg","photo_id":422424842,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/1\/0\/a\/600_422424842.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/1\/0\/a\/thumb_422424842.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":105761092,"name":"Rosalind Resnick"},"members":311,"name":"The Poetry Table","id":10994752,"state":"NY","urlname":"The-Poetry-Table","category":{"name":"literature\/writing","id":18,"shortname":"literature-writing"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Poets"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1383780115000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hadoop","name":"Hadoop","id":18060},{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"mapreduce","name":"MapReduce","id":27591},{"urlkey":"nosql","name":"NoSQL","id":58162},{"urlkey":"hive","name":"Hive","id":61679},{"urlkey":"hbase","name":"HBase","id":61680},{"urlkey":"using-hadoop-in-the-cloud","name":"Using Hadoop in the cloud","id":140255},{"urlkey":"impala","name":"Impala","id":146292},{"urlkey":"bigdata","name":"BigData","id":149894},{"urlkey":"apache-hadoop","name":"Apache Hadoop","id":284431},{"urlkey":"open-source-analytics","name":"Open Source Analytics","id":773382},{"urlkey":"apache-hbase","name":"APache HBase","id":1116052},{"urlkey":"cloudera","name":"Cloudera","id":1247352},{"urlkey":"hadoop-analytics","name":"Hadoop Analytics","id":1368642},{"urlkey":"hadoop-integration","name":"Hadoop Integration","id":1420902}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NY-Cloudera-User-Group\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This is a group for Cloudera customers in the New York tri-state area to network, share best practices, and exchange ideas around the Cloudera Big Data platform and components including Cloudera Impala, Cloudera Manager, Cloudera Navigator, HBase, and so on.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/c\/6\/2\/highres_436304130.jpeg","photo_id":436304130,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/c\/6\/2\/600_436304130.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/c\/6\/2\/thumb_436304130.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":118766022,"name":"Cloudera User Groups"},"members":187,"name":"NY Cloudera User Group","id":11000382,"state":"NY","urlname":"NY-Cloudera-User-Group","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Cuggers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1383795043000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"skiing","name":"Skiing","id":2294},{"urlkey":"snowboard","name":"Snowboarding","id":3425},{"urlkey":"ccskiing","name":"Cross-Country Skiing","id":3490},{"urlkey":"cross-country-skiing","name":"Cross Country Skiing","id":52821},{"urlkey":"skiers","name":"Skiers","id":65097}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-City-Ski-Gypsies\/","rating":0,"description":"The New York City Ski Gypsies is a club focused on local skiing and are typically people who also share the same passion for scuba diving and ocean conservation.

Musa is a direct disciple of the Sufi Saint Bawa Muhaiyaddeen.\u00a0As Musa explains, Sufism goes beyond all languages, religions and cultural backgrounds. This is a path open to all seekers of the unseen, those striving to connect to their spiritual inner life, to give new meaning and direction that is easily put into practice.<\/p>\n<p>You can hear many of Musa's discourses on his website at <a>www.thewitnesswithin.com.<\/a> His latest book, The Elixir of Truth: Journey on the Sufi Path, is available through Amazon.com.<\/p>\n<p>To quote Musa, \u201cThere is this mystery of man\u2019s relationship to God. Every person has this relationship. We need to explore this relationship, and make that exploration something that is a life-long priority. We identify with our bodies, but we are not our body. Similarly, we identify with our culture, language, religions, but we are not any of these things either. Our true story is the story of our real identity. We need to find what and who that is. Just as we have duties to our family, and within the work-sphere, at the same time we also have to do what is necessary to understand where reality is, and who we are in that reality.

Out of the shadows and sorrow, I find a lightness and purpose that I suspect I may never have found had I not had to endure and transform the pain of my husband's passing.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>JP changed me for the better in life and even more so, in death.\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10781686,"name":"Taruni"},"members":100,"name":"From grief to transformation","id":11203222,"state":"NY","urlname":"grief-to-transformation","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1385161766000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"fashion","name":"Fashion Industry","id":1924},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"shopping","name":"Shopping","id":9349},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"positive-thinking","name":"Positive Thinking","id":16212},{"urlkey":"fashion-and-style","name":"Fashion and Style","id":16575},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"spiritual-development","name":"Spiritual Development","id":19141},{"urlkey":"transformation","name":"Transformation","id":21591},{"urlkey":"spiritual-awakening","name":"Spiritual Awakening","id":69583}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Lolas-Boutique-More-Truth-Will-Set-You-Free-Class\/","rating":0,"description":"More Truth Will Set You Free is a workshop that helps people empower themselves, heal deep hurts, and awaken to a higher part of themselves.

We'll experiment with a number of member-driven approaches to keep things fresh, informative, and useful for everyone.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>While many of us have strong opinions on the issue, we strive to be non-partisan and open, and welcome <b>working<\/b> <b>and experienced<\/b> VO artisans from both the union and non-union sectors.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Admission will be limited, to assess the experience, proficiency levels, and skill sets of prospective members to help develop a framework that meets everyone's needs.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:<\/b><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>This group was created by and for EXPERIENCED voice talent only<\/b>. We're NOT another \"get rich by breaking into the VO biz\" outlet, educational school, or training resource.<\/p>\n<p><b>This means all of us have committed to make VO our primary source of income, or it's a real, significant and very regular part of it.<\/b><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>In other words, we've paid our dues by doing this for a long time, and do it for a living every single day. Not part-time, not as a hobby, not as a source of quick \"money on the side\" with several months in between doing something else. It's our full-time job, or truly augments it (for example, some talented individuals do equal amounts of stage\/film\/TV as well as VO work ). If this sounds like you, we welcome seeing your application!<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>If you're \"new to the biz\", or \"just looking to get into voiceover\/voice acting\", or simply want to \"kick the tires\" or \"try things out\" to learn more about the trade and see if it's right for you - unfortunately this group isn't designed for you. Please be advised if you apply, your request for membership will likely be rejected, and your\/our time will have been wasted.<br>\n\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Please don't take this personally. Rejection is a daily reality in our business. Pros shrug it off and use it to drive themselves further ahead. There's a lot that goes into this profession, and it's not for everyone!<\/p>\n<p>However, if you're still serious about doing this for a living in the future, there are plenty of outlets here on Meetup.com and elsewhere online that we highly encourage you to look into.

Over the last several years, I've become a licensed Zumba instructor, an ACE certified Group Fitness Instructor and a Mayo Clinic trained Wellness Coach.

We have a large email list, completely separate from this website, and get about 5 to 10 people per meeting just from that.<span> <br> <\/span> <span><span> <br> <\/span> Anyway, most importantly, this group is commitment-free. Some of our members attend nearly every meeting; others show up once a month or even once a year. The main rule is to bring something to work on for the first hour. No assignments. No prompts. It's just a solid chunk of quiet time that you can use however you want. <span> <br> <\/span> <span><span> <br> <\/span> After the writing, there's a short break, and then we gather a little closer to take turns introducing ourselves. After that, we spend another hour or so doing an informal reading of our work. No one is ever forced to read -- that's not our style -- so at any given meeting, about half the people might end up sharing something. Some people read stuff they've been working on for a while. Others read what they've written during the hour. There's n<\/span><\/span>o need to bring copies because we read aloud. Each person gets eight minutes, which includes time for others to offer feedback, so we keep things moving at a pretty good pace.&nbsp;<span><br> <\/span> <span> <br> <\/span> People in this group have written and shared all kinds of stuff:&nbsp;novels,&nbsp;short stories,&nbsp;journal and diary entries,&nbsp;poems,&nbsp;personal essays,&nbsp;memoirs, plays, screenplays,&nbsp;articles, dialogues, outlines, limericks, newsletters, blogs, kids books, science fiction, erotica, comedy, book proposals, cartoon strips, horoscopes, wedding speeches, eulogies, and song lyrics. Anything goes, and the same is true for your writing experience. You don't have to be published or submit samples in order to join. The purpose is to have a varied crowd and a relaxed setting where we actually do some writing and have a chance to hang out and meet fellow writers, and since people often ask, we're mostly in our 20s and 30s. <span> <br> <\/span> <span><span> <br> <\/span> We get together every week or two. There's no regular location because we usually meet in people's homes all over the place. (If you can host, please speak up!) Twice a year, we meet at a big, antiquarian bookstore in midtown. In warmer months, we meet semi-regularly in Central Park and other outdoor spots. We've even taken a few road trips as a group,&nbsp;<\/span>but we almost always stay within MetroCard range. Once per month (ish),&nbsp;we meet on weekend afternoons, but we usually do our thing on weeknights from 7:00 until about 10:30pm. People are welcome to show up late or leave early, so don't worry if these times aren't ideal. Can't make it for the writing hour? No problem. Come after that and check out the readings. <span> <br> <\/span> <span> <br> <\/span> <span>We don't have a set schedule. Some people are never free on Mondays, for example, while others can never make it on weekends, so we meet on different days of the week to accommodate everyone.<\/span> <br> <span><span> <br> <\/span> Finally, this group has always been free (and will remain so for people who are already part of it), but because of the cost of advertising on Meetup, there's a suggested donation of $1 -- not per meeting, but just at the first one you attend. <br> <\/span> <span><span> <br> <\/span> That's it.

The charts demonstrate the correct rhythms, chord voicings, riffs and song form. In some cases, actual Phil Lesh bass lines have been transcribed. \u00a0The Grateful Dead, like many bands, shows that compositions may be flexible and improvisations may be structured.<\/p>\n<p>Note to budding song writers and improvisers - understanding song form helps one to better develop a dramatic arc, memorize songs more easily and improves one\u2019s ability to improvise and compose.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><span>WHAT YOU CAN LEARN:<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>As we learn each song, participants will learn the correct chord\u00a0progressions and song\u00a0forms; the actual chord voicings Jerry used;\u00a0the actual chord voicings Bob used;\u00a0specific chord progressions used during the improv sections;\u00a0pentatonic\/blues boxes for soloing;\u00a0chord\/scale combinations; Jerry's use of chromaticism; complicated ostinatos; inversion of guitar roles; use of triads; alternating triads as an improvisational tool; modal scales as an improvisational tool; variations on tone production through the use of hybrid picking; and rhythm guitar adaptations of keyboard parts using two and three-note voicings with palm muting techniques.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span>As the group coordinator, I will discuss how to build solos and the group will jam on those songs.\u00a0 This is an opportunity to master your soloing skills.\u00a0 However, there is no obligation to improvise.\u00a0 There won\u2019t be any pressure to do so.\u00a0 People may simply strum along and enjoy that participation.<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><span>Although actual songs that the group covers is at the coordinator's discretion, group suggestions play a big part. \u00a0In previous sessions we have learned and jammed on over 50 songs including: \u00a0<\/span><span>Alabama Getaway, Bertha, Big River, Birdsong, Black Muddy River, Brown Eyed Women, Casey Jones, China Cat Sunflower, Deal, El Paso, Eyes Of The World, Fire On The Mountain, Franklin's Tower, Friend Of The Devil, Goin' Down The Road Feeling Bad, Good Lovin\u2019, I Know You Rider, Jack-A-Roe, Jackstraw, Johnny B.

There's something for everyone at NHOC. Aside from hiking, the club is involved with many activities including camping, walking, horseback riding, bicycling, picnicking, and just about anything which broadens knowledge of and respect for nature. Some members participate in trail maintenance and other conservation efforts. During the winter months, indoor as well as outdoor activities are offered. All hikes and activities are graded on their level of difficulty - from easy (\"C\") to challenging (\"A\"). We are a friendly, social group looking for new members. \u00a0Many of our members fall into the SINGLES category and there is no better way to find new friends than by participating in an activity that you love. If you decide to become a full paying member of NHOC, you will receive our Shorelines publication several times throughout the year, informing you of all of our activities. We organize 15-30 hikes per month throughout the New York area. Parties, social gatherings, city walks, movie nights, bowling, and weekend trips are only some of the wide range of activities that we plan for our members.

Thursday evenings, 85th and York, 7-9 p.m. Easy international folk songs and rounds; as time goes on we can tackle more challenging works. Sheet music and transliterated lyrics will be provided. No audition; no experience necessary, as long as your voice blends well and you enjoy holding a part against others, singing in harmony.<\/p>\n<p>I recently returned to NYC from San Francisco, where I led a similar women\u2019s singing group for ten years. I have collected songs from many countries. Your suggestions are also welcome, as are cookies! We will do a little vocal improvising, too. Small mellow dogs may join us. No cigaret smokers, please. This is an elevator building but there are a few steps to the lobby. RSVP and I will send the address.

If you have any ideas or suggestions for a meet up, please feel free to share them with me. Even though I am the founder of this group I value and respect people\u2019s opinions.<\/p>\n<p>Check us out on Facebook<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/298834220301089\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/298834220301089\/<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>\"Like\" us on Facebook<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/NYlatinosocialgroup\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/NYlatinosocialgroup<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>Follow us on Twitter<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Nylatinosocial\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/Nylatinosocial<\/a><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/b\/3\/0\/600_435906960.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/1\/3\/5\/600_438409461.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/4\/5\/7\/600_436525687.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/1\/7\/9\/600_438409529.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/f\/3\/600_435908947.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/c\/e\/600_403639662.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/5\/9\/c\/600_411425532.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/3\/4\/c\/600_433384940.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/a\/d\/8\/600_434503736.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/d\/f\/2\/600_436128626.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/0\/3\/1\/600_436412817.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/7\/d\/600_436525469.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/d\/8\/c\/600_437479852.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/a\/4\/3\/600_437571779.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/d\/c\/f\/600_437744495.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/d\/b\/b\/600_437744475.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/c\/b\/3\/600_438031923.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/1\/5\/4\/600_435912628.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/a\/a\/9\/600_435906825.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/a\/a\/d\/600_435906829.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/a\/a\/f\/600_435906831.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/a\/b\/3\/600_435906835.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/a\/b\/7\/600_435906839.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/a\/b\/c\/600_435906844.jpeg\"><\/p>","lon":-74.0199966431,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/f\/e\/highres_334264862.jpeg","photo_id":334264862,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/f\/e\/600_334264862.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/f\/e\/thumb_334264862.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":43843532,"name":"Omar"},"members":621,"name":"Nueva York Latino Social Group","id":12798262,"state":"NY","urlname":"Nueva-York-Latino-Social-Group","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.6399993896,"who":"NYC Latinos"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1391980759000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"acting","name":"Acting","id":226},{"urlkey":"acappella","name":"A Cappella","id":1480},{"urlkey":"toastmasters","name":"Toastmasters","id":3307},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"publicspeaking","name":"Public Speaking","id":9300},{"urlkey":"music","name":"Music","id":15018},{"urlkey":"singers","name":"Singing","id":17301},{"urlkey":"performing-arts","name":"Performing Arts","id":17558},{"urlkey":"live-theatre","name":"Theater","id":23274},{"urlkey":"singing-for-beginners","name":"Singing for Beginners","id":39174},{"urlkey":"fear-of-public-speaking","name":"Fear of Public Speaking","id":42862},{"urlkey":"choir","name":"Choir","id":48306},{"urlkey":"song-writing","name":"Songwriting","id":72969}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Voice-Lessons-in-Midtown\/","rating":4.72,"description":"<p>Here you will be given clear advice that will make the most of your talent.

PONY allows its students to benefit from the same excellent, conservatory-trained musicians who teach the paying students of the Piano School of New York.\n\nPONY's scholarships cover 50-80% of the cost of the lessons, with parents, schools or PTAs making up the difference. Class size is small: three to six students. Piano-playing skills, note reading and writing, ear training, and rhythm are taught, together with music history. Each class is designed to meet the children.s individual needs according to their ages, and all children are introduced to a wide range of music, from sacred choral works of the Renaissance to 20th century jazz. PONY classes are educational, inspiring, and just plain fun! Each student receives individual piano instruction at every session, performs for and with classmates, and plays duets with their teachers. Year-end recitals at Alfred Lerner Hall at Columbia University provide a tremendous incentive and are highly rewarding to all participating students.\n\nPONY was incorporated in 2003 and has been approved by the IRS as a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization. It is an outgrowth of the Piano School of New York, which since its founding in 2001 has experienced extraordinary growth. Today more than 1500 children in over 60 public, parochial, and nursery schools throughout the City are enrolled in our group classes. At a time when spending on the arts in schools has been drastically cut back, the Piano School and the Piano Outreach actually bring the only music into many schools in New York City. In fact, The Piano School of New York has been placing pianos and\/or keyboards in schools where no instrument is available.\n","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/9\/0\/highres_338099792.jpeg","photo_id":338099792,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/9\/0\/600_338099792.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/9\/0\/thumb_338099792.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":120364042,"name":"Nat Berman"},"members":12,"name":"Piano Outreach of New York","id":13118922,"state":"NY","urlname":"Piano-Outreach-of-New-York","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Montclair","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1393688588000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Jersey-Fit-Club\/","rating":4.8,"description":"<p>Hi Everyone!&nbsp; Welcome.<\/p>\n<p>My vision for this group =&nbsp;\"grown-up gym class\" for anyone 26 and older. <br> <\/p>\n<p>Purpose:&nbsp; To get together at least once\/week for a pick-up game involving a different activity each time, with the emphasis on making fitness fun - basically, to get outside and play!

It's called unusual because it refers to a special kind of misfit, where you are not necessarily a misfit in all aspects of your life, but one or more of them and you feel really unusual, awkward or inexplicable about why you were not able to fit in. For example, it could be at work, in your family, or in your dating life with same\/opposite sex, or your surrounding society. These are the people who are waiting to fit into those areas that they always had trouble fitting in, but wanted to fit in. I understand that the name 'misfits' is used in television\/movie titles, but I have never watched any of them. So, just to be clear, this group is not an imitation or is not inspired by any sort of fiction. We can discuss our issues as to why we are not able to fit in those certain areas of life - probably come up with a solution or just laugh it off and move on.
