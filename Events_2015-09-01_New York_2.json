Traditionally, the answer has been traditional media organizations. However, these days most people will agree that Twitter has become a big part of the news generation and dissemination process. While Twitter is being used, however the process of news discovery is almost universally rudimentary; limited to searching using keywords that one may think of. Thomson Reuters R&amp;D along with our Reuters news division, has built a ground up technology that automates the news discovery process from social sources. Sameena, who led the research and development of this product, will highlight the machine learning and NLP algorithms contribution in this breakthrough technology.<\/p> <p><b>Joyce Shen<\/b> is the Director of Emerging Technology Partnerships &amp; Investments at Thomson Reuters.

Collaborations with these experts yield a broad range of opportunities, possibly the most significant of which is making the invisible visible through both pure and applied research.<\/p> <p>Over generations of design education and practice, architects have learned to use different types of information to produce buildings. Now we are entering a new era of information availability and application. How do you prove that good design is a matter of life and death? Why do architects need the social sciences, and why do social scientists need architecture? What data and research methods can make buildings that lift the human spirit? This program seeks to map out new ground for novel collaborations, particularly those with practitioners and researchers in the social sciences.<\/p> <p>It is increasingly clear that the social sciences, which include a wide range of fields, from psychology and anthropology to sociology and data sciences, have much to contribute to our field.

There has never been a time when the role of the architect has been more relevant as an instrument to shape culture, society, and positive environmental outcomes. \u201cDialogues\u201d will engage the practitioners amongst us who are breaking rules, trying new things, and taking new risks\u2014expanding the impact of the architect\u2014and disseminate their experiences to our professional community.<\/p> <p><b>Panelists:<\/b><br\/><b>Scott Francisco<\/b>, Founder and Director, Pilot Projects, is a hands-on designer, strategist, and cultural theorist in New York City who focuses on infrastructure and culture in organizations and cities.

Subsequent releases have added features to improve the data loading experience and performance. Some of these improvements include column name aliases (which can be used to overcome the 45 columns limit), the ability to map more than one spreadsheet column into one table column, advanced transformation rules, the ability to skip some steps (useful for larger set of records), better management of concurrency, and improved error handling.

Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside as a backup.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p><b>Do members need to bring anything?\u00a0<\/b><br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<\/b>\u00a0<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p><b>What should a newcomer expect?\u00a0<\/b><br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly. We have a colorful cast of characters from all walks of life who are ready and willing to have a good time.<\/p> <p>Whether you're interested in easy-going rallying or competitive play, we can accommodate you.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?\u00a0<\/b><br\/>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments; please send them to our head organizer, Frank Tirado via email.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bronxtennis\/events\/224373014\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Thursday Night Tennis @ Crotona Park","id":"224373014","time":1438898400000,"updated":1438943854000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335455062000,"name":"Bronx Tennis","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":3746792,"urlname":"bronxtennis","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07644","country":"us","city":"Lodi","address_1":"Memorial Drive","address_2":"The entrance is on Arnot St.","name":"Lodi Memorial Park","lon":-74.087196,"id":1134320,"state":"NJ","lat":40.876096,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":24,"headcount":6,"distance":10.107260704,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438392222000,"fee":{"amount":2,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":4,"average":4.75},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Lodi-Outdoor-Volleyball-Meetup\/events\/224321947\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Play Volleyball","id":"xnfqjlytlbjb","time":1438898400000,"updated":1438952321000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1438389570000,"name":"Lodi Outdoor Volleyball Meetup","group_lon":-74.0800018311,"id":18790121,"urlname":"Lodi-Outdoor-Volleyball-Meetup","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Paramus","address_1":"116 E Century Rd","name":"Paramus Library","lon":-74.060921,"id":19993272,"lat":40.926895,"repinned":false},"headcount":30,"distance":12.7982559204,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432055177000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.67000007629},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us as we watch and hear the tribute band ''Eaglemania'' performing classic Eagles hits.

We'll tackle that at the upcoming meeting. For those that are already trading, we'll also talk about having a process and enhancing what you're doing.<\/p> <p>A description of the agenda follows this note.<\/p> <p><br\/>Hope you can make it.<\/p> <p>Best,<\/p> <p>*Mitch FIrestone<\/p> <p>Organizer<\/p> <p>\n\n\n=======================<\/p> <p>Getting Started \u2013 Trading is a progression:<\/p> <p>First, you need to determine the type of trader you wish\/need to be based on your lifestyle, temperament, interest in trading, the time you wish to devote to it, and risk capital you have. The main styles of trading are position trading (long-term positions, sometimes referred to as buy-and-hold), long-term swing positions (a few weeks to months), shorter-term swing positions (1+ days to a few days or a couple weeks), intraday (a.k.a. Day-trading where you open &amp; close a position within the same trading day), and scalping (a few minutes to a few seconds. These are often trades that take on large position-size in order to grab profits with a small move in price in a very short time).<\/p> <p>Next you need to adopt &amp; start learning some set of core trading principles \u2013 e.g.,<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0momentum methodologies based on trend analysis and price action using chart patterns or specific candlestick formations. This entails getting into a trade where there is a well defined, strong directional price movement. You open a position based on certain metrics. This is akin to jumping into the back of a pickup truck as it's going by you, or when it slows or pauses a bit &amp; then continues in the same direction.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0retracement methodologies, again based on trend analysis and price action using chart patterns or specific candlestick formations. Here you identify the overarching trend or local price movement, then wait for price to reverse in order to return (correct or retrace) to a particular price level where it will then be expected to reverse and start heading back in its original direction. This predominant move is referred as the impulse. The reversal is into the zone is the correction. This is akin to watching a car go by &amp; waiting for it to turn around &amp; pick you up &amp; then reverse in the original direction it was traveling. The popular waiting to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d is the poster child for a retracement strategy.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0an intelligent combination of indicators and oscillators (moving averages, RSI, CCI, stochastics, MACD, etc.)<\/p> <p>Once you've mastered core trading principles and a general methodology, you then need to <i><b>adopt and\/or develop a strategy<\/b><\/i>, e.g., \u201cI will buy stocks to hold for a few days that are in a daily uptrend in the strongest two industrial sectors, and will use a lower timeframe to enter this broad trend using one of the three methods above (momentum, retracement or indicators\/oscillators).<\/p> <p>Following from the strategy you then need to determine the specific steps, tools and analysis you are going to do to screen for opportunities and then establish and qualify set-ups. <i><b>These are your tactics.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>Given our discussions at the July 14 meet-up and how many people are hunting for how to take the first steps in exploring trading we will step people through everything above, and tell you about what we do here in the trade room with our personal trading as well as novice and experienced traders we work with. This will give you a starting point in determining a logical route to exploring the world of trading.<\/b><\/i><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"between 5th & 6th Aves","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Technical-Trader-Talks\/events\/224104818\/","yes_rsvp_count":26,"duration":9000000,"name":"Meeting Announcement -- Thur Aug 6 @ 6:30pm","id":"224104818","time":1438900200000,"updated":1439303060000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1377713333000,"name":"NYC Technical Trader Talks","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":10010282,"urlname":"NYC-Technical-Trader-Talks","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Traders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.692301332951,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438436468000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come and meet our community of local real estate investors, build your network, and learn why real estate is IDEAL and why you should be involved with our community of real estate investors.

We'll tackle that at the upcoming meeting. For those that are already trading, we'll also talk about having a process and enhancing what you're doing.<\/p> <p><br\/>Getting Started \u2013 Trading is a progression:<\/p> <p>First, you need to determine the type of trader you wish\/need to be based on your lifestyle, temperament, interest in trading, the time you wish to devote to it, and risk capital you have. The main styles of trading are position trading (long-term positions, sometimes referred to as buy-and-hold), long-term swing positions (a few weeks to months), shorter-term swing positions (1+ days to a few days or a couple weeks), intraday (a.k.a. Day-trading where you open &amp; close a position within the same trading day), and scalping (a few minutes to a few seconds. These are often trades that take on large position-size in order to grab profits with a small move in price in a very short time).<\/p> <p>Next you need to adopt &amp; start learning some set of core trading principles \u2013 e.g.,\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0momentum methodologies based on trend analysis and price action using chart patterns or specific candlestick formations. This entails getting into a trade where there is a well defined, strong directional price movement. You open a position based on certain metrics. This is akin to jumping into the back of a pickup truck as it's going by you, or when it slows or pauses a bit &amp; then continues in the same direction.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0retracement methodologies, again based on trend analysis and price action using chart patterns or specific candlestick formations. Here you identify the overarching trend or local price movement, then wait for price to reverse in order to return (correct or retrace) to a particular price level where it will then be expected to reverse and start heading back in its original direction. This predominant move is referred as the impulse. The reversal is into the zone is the correction. This is akin to watching a car go by &amp; waiting for it to turn around &amp; pick you up &amp; then reverse in the original direction it was traveling. The popular waiting to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d is the poster child for a retracement strategy.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0an intelligent combination of indicators and oscillators (moving averages, RSI, CCI, stochastics, MACD, etc.)<\/p> <p>Once you've mastered core trading principles and a general methodology, you then need to\u00a0<i>adopt and\/or develop a strategy<\/i>, e.g., \u201cI will buy stocks to hold for a few days that are in a daily uptrend in the strongest two industrial sectors, and will use a lower timeframe to enter this broad trend using one of the three methods above (momentum, retracement or indicators\/oscillators).<\/p> <p>Following from the strategy you then need to determine the specific steps, tools and analysis you are going to do to screen for opportunities and then establish and qualify set-ups.\u00a0<i>These are your tactics.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Given our discussions at the July 14 meet-up and how many people are hunting for how to take the first steps in exploring trading we will step people through everything above, and tell you about what we do here in the trade room with our personal trading as well as novice and experienced traders we work with. This will give you a starting point in determining a logical route to exploring the world of trading.<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-City-Stock-Traders\/events\/224152778\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Meeting:Special Announcement -- Thur Aug 6 @ 6:30pm","id":"224152778","time":1438900200000,"updated":1438912361000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1401289115000,"name":"New York City Stock Traders","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":14728282,"urlname":"New-York-City-Stock-Traders","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Traders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"845 Third Ave 20 FL","name":"Dr. Alicia Armitstead's Office","lon":-73.969749,"id":23769863,"state":"NY","lat":40.756626,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.15694403648,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437936316000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>I have given a lot of advice to patients about how to manage stress through eating right, breathing exercises, affirmations, meditation, tapping, etc. Now learn what Dr. Armitstead has to say about using essential oils to help you decrease your stress.

The hour-long class will provide a nice change of pace for those pregnant women who are bored and unmotivated by the typical prenatal workouts.

Although non-pregnant hoopers will also be in attendance, modifications for all pregnant hoopers will be taught as necessary. \u00a0Please let me know if you'll need to rent a hoop for $3.\u00a0Class costs $20 (cash only) or a package of 10 is $180 (get one class free!).\u00a0<b>(In the event of rain, we'll likely be under the covered area on the East River Promenade (East River near 82nd Street) but be sure to check in with me before heading over.)

Mosley (Known to Evil) plays out an intriguing premise in his powerful latest: a man is given a second shot at life, but at the price of a hastened death. Ptolemy Grey is a 91-year-old man, suffering from dementia and living as a recluse in his Los Angeles apartment. With one foot in the past and the other in the grave, Ptolemy begins to open up when Robyn Small, a 17-year-old family friend, appears and helps clean up his apartment and straighten out his life. A reinvigorated Ptolemy volunteers for an experimental medical program that will restore his mind, but at hazardous cost: he won't live to see 92. With the clock ticking, Ptolemy uses his rejuvenated mental abilities to delve into the mystery of the recent drive-by shooting death of his great-nephew, Reggie, and to render justice the only way he knows how, goaded and guided by the memory of his murdered childhood mentor, Coydog McCann. Though the details of the experimental procedure are less than convincing, Mosley's depiction of the indignities of old age is heartbreaking, and Ptolemy's grace and decency make for a wonderful character and a moving novel.

If you cannot park in the lot nearest the beginning of the path, you'll need to reenter the park and park in the next closest lot. The driving area of the park is U-shaped so to get to the parking lot closest to the start of the run, you essentially drive around the \"U\" and approach the exit to the last lot on the right (by the dog park).<\/p> <p><br\/>We will start at the \"Wild Duck Pond Area\" and will turn around at some point. If you'd like to run additional miles, you are certainly more than welcome to do so as the mile markers make it simple to track your distance.

This is a fun run, not a competition.<\/p> <p>For those who wish to stick around after the run, we may get together at (insert favorite Ridgewood hot spot here) to relax, catch up, and share some laughs.

Effective altruism is about recognizing the importance of using our lives to do the most good we can and looking for ways to help others that are high-impact and well-supported by evidence. This approach may sound obvious, but careful consideration of the impact of different strategies for doing good can lead to some surprising, and even controversial, conclusions. Ethical philosophy, career strategizing, economics, and persuasion methods play important roles in these considerations, so EA attracts smart people and provides intellectually invigorating topics of discussion.<\/p> <p>A great way to start learning about our perspective is to watch Peter Singer's TED talk:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en<\/a><\/p> <p>If it piques your interest, have a look through the introductory links on the Effective Altruism Forum:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/effective-altruism.com\/ea\/6x\/introduction_to_effective_altruism\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/effective-altruism.com\/ea\/6x\/introduction_to_effective_altruism\/<\/a><\/p> <p>...and let us know what you think!<\/p> <p>Feel free to send me a message if you'd like to know more.

When they are assigned a mission as punishment for their latest recklessness by the mayor of Palisade and it turns out to be a trap, Hannah, Violet, Dee, and Betty come back to the town to figure out who has it in for them and the other local fighting gangs. And if they have to beat up a few people and monsters to do it, then that\u2019s just fine by them. Wiebe and Upchurch offer readers three-dimensional female characters with varying body types, races, sexual orientations, and backstories, while also including all the intriguing side characters, crude language, drug use, magic, violence, and sarcasm that a humorous, adult action-fantasy volume should have. Upchurch\u2019s art has beautiful depth, and his panels glow with life. Offer this to readers tired of the same old comics featuring cheesecake depictions of female characters or to readers who like intelligent plots with a side of smart aleck.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Purchase:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Rat-Queens-Sass-Sorcery-TP\/dp\/1607069458\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436887603&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rat+queens+vol+1\">Amazon <\/a><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.barnesandnoble.com\/w\/rat-queens-volume-1-roc-upchurch\/1120752613?ean=9781607069454\">Barnes &amp; Noble <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.comixology.com\/Rat-Queens-Vol-1-Sass-Sorcery\/digital-comic\/86920\">Comixology<\/a><\/p> <p>Or your local comic book store!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Girl-Geek-Adventure-Club\/events\/223916872\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"August Comic Club - Rat Queens Vol 1:  Sass & Sorcery ","id":"223916872","time":1438902000000,"updated":1438914014000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1315347100000,"name":"NYC Girl Geek Adventure Club","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":2444702,"urlname":"NYC-Girl-Geek-Adventure-Club","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1430417509000,"rating":{"count":5,"average":4.59999990463},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><i>Special Exclusive: At this meetup, we will be raffling off 2 tickets to the Cooper U design courses taking place in NYC this August! \u00a0<\/i><\/b><b><i>(more info @\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/tpg.li\/cooperu\"><a href=\"http:\/\/tpg.li\/cooperu\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/tpg.li\/cooperu<\/a><\/a>)<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Share, learn and network with fellow Product Managers at The Product Group.<\/p> <p><br\/>Some topics to expect...<br\/>- Collaboration (Strategies, Processes, Styles)<br\/>- and more...<\/p> <p>Featured Product:\u00a0<b>Researchscape<\/b><\/p> <p><i>From Tony Cheevers, VP of Business Development at Researchscape...<\/i><br\/>\"I'm the VP, Business Development and \u2018voice of the customer\u2019 product manager for Researchscape International (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.researchscape.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.researchscape.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.researchscape.com\/<\/a><\/a>).

You will BLAST away calories, while building strength and increasing your endurance. You will be working every muscle group in this class. Although, you will\u00a0be building strength in your core throughout the entire class, there will be more emphasis and focus on that area in the last 8 minutes of this class. I take advanced level exercise drills to challenge even my elite athletes - my warriors. I show you how it's done at an advanced level, and then I take that exercise and I demonstrate that same exercise taking out the high intensity to bring it down to a beginner and intermediate level so that there are no excuses - this class rocks for all fitness levels. We start off easy, and we increase our intensity throughout each set.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>If you try out these classes, you will love them and want more.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>A revoloutanary \u00a0cardio-based total-body conditioning program is based on the principles of MAX interval training. INSANITY pushes the participants to new training heights, resulting in more calories burned, faster results and more efficient metabolism. This interval training is the pinnacle of cardio training. You don't have to be in extreme shape - levels of each exercise are provided.<br\/>Insanity's not your traditional interval workout. It replaces traditional moderate-intensity exercise with maximum-intensity exercise, and trades short intervals of intensity for short periods of rest. The secret? Long periods of explosive intensity. You\u2019ll do cardio and plyometric drills with intervals of strength, power, resistance, and core training. With Insanity, you can burn up to 1,000 calories in an hour. Participants experience faster increases in cardiovascular fitness and burn carbohydrates and fat more efficiently.<\/p> <p>Class Description:<br\/>PLYOMETRICS for insane legs and gluts, UPPER BODY RESISTANCE for sculpted arms, shoulders, chest, and back.

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free. (Note: Although these classic articles are somewhat dated, decades of research on happiness reveal that findings on happiness tend to be extremely stable over time.)<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download?doi=10.1.1.335.9655&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change <\/a><br\/>By S Lyubomirsky, KM Sheldon and D Schkade, 2005.\u00a0 21 pages<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Kesebir-Diener_2008.pdf\">In Pursuit of Happiness: Empirical Answers to Philosophical Questions<\/a><br\/>By P Kesebir and E Diener, 2008. 9 pages.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Diener-Suh-Lucas-Smith_1999.pdf\">Subjective Well-Being: Three Decades of Progress<\/a><br\/>By E Diener, EM Suh, RE Lucas and HL Smith, 1999. 27 pages<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Happiness-and-Goodness-Club-White-Plains\/events\/224135761\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":5400000,"name":"Happiness and its Distractions  7:30-9pm at Barnes & Noble in White Plains","id":"mhqchlytlbjb","time":1438903800000,"updated":1438911510000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1398801633000,"name":"The Happiness and Goodness Club - White Plains","group_lon":-73.75,"id":14180342,"urlname":"The-Happiness-and-Goodness-Club-White-Plains","group_lat":41.0099983215,"who":"Very Happy People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11221","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"941 Willoughby Avenue","name":"little skips","lon":-73.93132,"id":2009361,"state":"NY","lat":40.697739,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.75091171265,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432833198000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Tonight's topic will be whether we should take the bible literally or figurative.<\/p> <p>1.

So sign on with us for the conference call to discuss issues and contribute your thoughts about what we can be doing politically.

Despite its name, the music often has a fast and happy rhythm. It is characterized by virtuosity, improvisation and subtle modulations, and is full of syncopation and counterpoint. Choro is considered the first characteristically Brazilian genre of urban popular music.

No refunds once the group purchase of the tickets is made!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Because we're watching on opening weekend there will be a line inside the multiplex in front of the theater. Trying to meet before going in could lead to awful seats for everyone because some people will be rushing from work and might be a little late. Instead, we all get our tickets before hand and then meet up afterwards to discuss the movie (and this way everyone gets to watch the movie in their favorite seats).<\/p> <p><br\/>While we are not going to wait until the bitter end for every RSVP to show up, and therefore lose all the good seats, we are going to be there 45 minutes ahead of time with a MG Meetup sign. We will be going up to the theater line once it opens. If you come up a little later to the theater line and want to sit with us in the middle section of the middle set of seats don't cut the line, just let us know when you get upstairs and we'll hold the seat for you (because you are already there, just further back in the line). But if you prefer another spot, that's ok too. Just pick your own seat. If you are kept late and work and get there 5 minutes after the trailers begin, you don't have to worry about the Group yelling at you because we held a seat for 30 minutes and you couldn't find us. (This is our first month doing this so we are working to make it as stress free as possible for everyone involved and it is a work in progress).<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nThe total member discount price is $11.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p>We'll play 3 simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with goals. There will be 6 teams on the field and we will play three games, 30 minutes\/game. Every 30 minutes we will have a short break and teams will switch to play against different team. Please check your email or our meetup message board on friday night or before 12.00pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p>If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.<\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>Riverside Park\u00a0at West\u00a0107 &amp; 108 Street<\/p> <p>Take the 1 RED Line Train to Cathedral Pkwy an walk two blocks down,\u00a0to 108th Street and Riverside Dr.<\/p> <p>The field is down the lower level near the river.

Jump balls\/disputed calls will be determined by a three pointer since the laws of basketball physics are very clear that \"the ball never lies.\"<\/p> <p>5. Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds. 6. Subs will enter the game no later than 6 points in (once one of the teams reaches 6 points). The sub will start the following game. Teams will regulate themselves but let's make sure everyone plays.<\/p> <p>See you on the court!

Also feel free to bring your own basketball for shoot-around. And don't forget to clip your nails prior to game day.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a
