I'm Ed Lee, the organizer of this Meetup and you must be reading this because you're crazy about photography in the Big Apple!&nbsp; We welcome all, whether you're a beginner or an experienced pro. We're here to help you improve your \"photo eye\" and translate your visions to images you can share with others!&nbsp; Networking and socializing with other photogs is my goal.&nbsp; Field trips in and around metro NYC are but one of the many activities I have planned.&nbsp; Others include interesting and historic sites, gallery hops, classes and speakers and any and everything related to our favorite hobby.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>As I mentioned, your skill level with a camera is not important! The type of camera you are using is not important as we have photographers with camera phones, film cameras as well as digital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The NY Photo &amp; Safari Meetup group's main focus (pardon the pun) is to go to locations and events in metro New York City to shoot great photographs!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>We hope to encourage you to get off the couch or leave your computer behind, to pick up your camera and join us for one or many of our upcoming events.<\/span><\/strong> <span>If you have always wanted to visit places that you would not go on your own or never thought about to visit.

The rest of the players take on the roles of individual fictional characters and explore that world, often becoming heroes in the story. The story is like a completely interactive \"choose your own adventure\" book.

Yes, this includes requests or propositions to stud, sell or buy a dog. Any mention of things eluding to such, whether at the Meetups or on our webpage, will be grounds for removal from the group. Period.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n 2) This group is comprised of many FRIENDLY, non-dominant or aggressive Frenchies, and we want to keep it that way. Thus while this group is meant for socializing dogs and we do understand that some who are new to the group, or being around other dogs in general, may be overwhelmed at first, we will not tolerate a continual over-aggressor and said party will be asked respectfully to refrain from coming again until their dog is more comfortable in larger-scale situations.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n 3) Each owner is responsible for the dog(s) they bring. This means you are to be watching, aware and on top of YOUR dog's behavior and actions at all times, specifically their attitudes and cleanliness. While we encourage socializing amongst the human participants, this is ultimately about the dogs' enjoyment, and parents must be steadfast in the monitoring of their personal dogs during play time to make sure that everything is going smoothly and that all dogs are having fun. As stated, over-aggressors will not be tolerated; this includes dogs who hump\/mount\/chase excessively or with aggression, instigate issues with others or actually aggressively bark at, growl or bite other dogs. Additionally, accidents (poop, pee, vomit or otherwise) are the responsibility of each owner to clean up immediately. We often times meet at indoor locations as well as nice community dog parks where we, the NYC French Bulldogs Meetup, are responsible for picking up after ourselves in order to be eligible to utilize the spaces. YOU are responsible for cleaning up after your dog promptly, no one else -<br>\n\n<br>\n\n 4) We require that the health of the dogs who attend Meetups be of the highest standard!! No puppies under the age of 5 months are allowed due to their compromised immune systems and ability to carry and pass germs along more readily than older dogs. Additionally, dogs are not welcome to attend Meetup if their vaccinations are not current (all dogs should be wearing collar and tags for verification) and up to date for their age, if they are in Heat or showing any signs of being close to a breeding cycle, if they've been experiencing or exposed to ANY SIGNS of illness within the last week, or if there are any open sores present on the day of the gathering.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n 5) Meetups are generally held once a month at varying locations around the city. We do our best to meet in convenient spots, and we are always looking for suggestions of large places our members would like to see us go. Indoor locations are generally only utilized if necessary per the weather, and we try to choose dog parks based on their level of public activity\/cleanliness\/safety as well as the ability to separate small and large breeds from each other. Please understand that this group is solely facilitated by Frenchie owners; no professional trainers or organizers host these events, so while we do our best to keep everything in line and running smoothly, there are times when we may not be able to meet due to extenuating circumstances and\/or things happen that are out of our control. We strive to avoid those times, but we appreciate your flexibility and willingness to go with the flow.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n 6) NYC French Bulldogs costs $12\/year to be a part of. This fee goes towards the rental of any indoor spaces we may meet at throughout the year as well as covering the fee that Meetup.com charges us to use this site for facilitation of the group.\u00a0\u00a0 In the event that our fund is running low I will ask members to help contribute to the cost of the indoor meetups.\u00a0 Any overage after all monies are collected, will be donated to French Bulldog Rescue Network in the NYC French Bulldogs Meetup's name to help aid FBRN in their mission to rescue and rehabilitate French Bulldogs throughout North America who aren't as lucky as ours.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n 7) Awesome members -- both 2 and 4-legged -- make for awesome Meetups!! We are happy to have all who are happy to abide by the rules and be upstanding members of the group!! Remember The Golden Rule, and we'll see you at the next NYC French Bulldogs Meetup!!<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for reading our rules!<\/p>\n<p>Joy (and Toby)<\/p>","lon":-73.9400024414,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/f\/b\/a\/highres_297688602.jpeg","photo_id":297688602,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/f\/b\/a\/600_297688602.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/f\/b\/a\/thumb_297688602.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":5777803,"name":"joy"},"members":824,"name":"FRENCH BULLDOG NYC","id":64078,"state":"NY","urlname":"frenchbulldog-6","category":{"name":"pets\/animals","id":26,"shortname":"pets-animals"},"lat":40.8499984741,"who":"French Bulldog Lovers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1066858789000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"thai","name":"Thai Language and Culture","id":2095},{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"thai-language","name":"Thai language","id":164396}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/thai-7\/","rating":4.71,"lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/9\/c\/highres_97532.jpeg","photo_id":97532,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/9\/c\/600_97532.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/9\/c\/thumb_97532.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":1307552,"name":"gaelee"},"members":499,"name":"Thai Language Meetup of NYC and NJ","id":153174,"state":"NY","urlname":"thai-7","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Thai Speakers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1066858789000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"divorcesupport","name":"Divorce Support","id":1570}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/divorcesupport-56\/","rating":4.65,"description":"<p>Our group is helpful for those going through a separation or divorce and is an open forum for discussions regarding our situations.

There are approximately 500 members of this group, although few can make it to each meeting, so gatherings have usually been quite intimate.We are Italian expatriates and advanced Italian language speakers looking for an opportunity to speak this beautiful language and visit Italy.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/8\/b\/c\/highres_254567292.jpeg","photo_id":254567292,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/8\/b\/c\/600_254567292.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/8\/b\/c\/thumb_254567292.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":2424178,"name":"REDAZIONE italianiallestero.TV"},"members":1276,"name":"ITALIANI NYc  italian language  www.ITALIANIALLESTERO.TV","id":196664,"state":"NY","urlname":"italianiallestero-TV","category":{"name":"language\/ethnic identity","id":16,"shortname":"language"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Italians italiani all'estero"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"members","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1109715223000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"literature","name":"Literature","id":15321}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bookclub-307\/","rating":4.77,"description":"<p>Join the NYC Bookclub for casual and fun book discussions.

Many of these techniques are best described as alternative medicine, including meditation, prayer, mental healing, movement re-education, and therapies that use creative outlets such as art, music, or dance. Others have now become mainstream (for example, patient support groups and cognitive-behavioral therapy).<\/p>\n<p>2) http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mind-body_connection The biopsychosocial model (abbreviated \"BPS\") is a general model or approach that posits that biological, psychological (which entails thoughts, emotions, and behaviors), and social factors, all play a significant role in human functioning in the context of disease or illness. Indeed, health is best understood in terms of a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors rather than purely in biological terms.[1] This is in contrast to the traditional, reductionist biomedical model of medicine that suggests every disease process can be explained in terms of an underlying deviation from normal function such as a pathogen, genetic or developmental abnormality, or injury.[2] The concept is used in fields such as medicine, nursing, health psychology and sociology, and particularly in more specialist fields such as psychiatry, health psychology, family therapy, chiropractic, clinical social work, and clinical psychology. The biopsychosocial paradigm is also a technical term for the popular concept of the \"mind\u2013body connection\", which addresses more philosophical arguments between the biopsychosocial and biomedical models, rather than their empirical exploration and clinical application.[3] The model was theorized by psychiatrist George L. Engel at the University of Rochester, and putatively discussed in a 1977 article in Science,[2] where he posited \"the need for a new medical model\"; however no single definitive, irreducible model has been published.[4] However, the general BPS model has guided formulation and testing of models within each professional field. Interestingly, evidence for the application of the biopsychosocial model was found in ancient Asian (2600 B.C.) and Greek (500 B.C.) civilizations prior to Engel's introduction of the theory in 1977. The novelty, acceptance, and prevalence of the biopsychosocial model varies across cultures.[1] Theodore Millon has extensively researched the Biopsychosocial model and has developed a systematic approach to understanding the clinical presentations found in many treatment settings.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/1\/7\/6\/highres_121853622.jpeg","photo_id":121853622,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/1\/7\/6\/600_121853622.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/1\/7\/6\/thumb_121853622.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8238496,"name":"Joel.E3"},"members":201,"name":"Connecting Mind & Body NYC","id":214083,"state":"NY","urlname":"mind-body-NYC","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"MindBody Explorers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1131937887000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"snowboard","name":"Snowboarding","id":3425}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYSG-SNOW\/","rating":4.61,"description":"<p>Welcome to the virtual home of NYSG!

A blossoming of political discourse in cafes and pubs led to demands for self rule in the capital. Unfortunately, the Prague Spring uprising was crushed with Soviet Tanks, but their spirit inspired our group's desire to exchange ideas on the domestic and international affairs.<\/p>\n<p>Prague Spring was founded in 2003 in New York City. The group picks a topic, identifies articles or chooses a book and engages in a focused, in-depth discussion. Prague Spring\u2019s strength comes from its members' diversity of ethnicity and careers as well as the spectrum of perspectives from conservative to liberal. Prague Spring welcomes anyone who can offer insight deeper than a TV sound bite, differ respectfully from their peers or simply enjoy an intelligent, informed debate.<\/p>\n<p>Our meetings types include:<\/p>\n<p>1. Topic Discussions: These meetings typically focus on a political issue currently dominating the news. We circulate articles and focus on the particular topic with a vigorous debate.<\/p>\n<p>2. Book Club: Prague Spring chooses books dealing with major issues in international affairs, either those that have shaped civilizations in the past or the generational challenges we face today. (For more details see the About Us section)<\/p>\n<p>3. Outside Events: Prague Spring identifies events sponsored by other organizations that we think may interest our members. Often we will socialize together at or after these events.<\/p>\n<p>Prague Spring encourages you to participate and submit any ideas you may have to Lee, Prague Spring\u2019s Founder and Organizer.

I have been the organizer of this group since June 2009. I diagnosed myself with Asperger Syndrome in 1997 and had it clinically confirmed in 1998. I started an adult Asperger's Syndrome support group in Phoenix, AZ in 2002 that thrives to this day. In April of 2008 I moved back to NJ after a nine-year absence, and began attending meetings of the Princeton Asperger Syndrome Meetup, which David Boticelli, the previous organizer of this group, had recently started.<\/p>\n<p>Asperger's Syndrome is a form of autism that involves a variety of symptoms that include:<\/p>\n<p>-Difficulty having one-on-one relationships,<br>\n\n -Following a strict schedule,<br>\n\n -A fascination with one topic in particular,<br>\n\n -Taking things literally that should be taken figuratively,<br>\n\n -Hypersensitivity to loud noises and odors,<br>\n\n -Inability to show facial expressions and body language,<br>\n\n just to name a few.<\/p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that I am not a mental health professional and I cannot diagnose anyone. But if you have been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, think you may have AS or know someone who has AS, I invite you to join this group. We meet once a month and can discuss the symptoms of Asperger's Syndrome, whether or not you or someone you know has been diagnosed with it or may have it, discuss personal experiences and possible treatments. I hope with this group, members can gain a better understanding of this disorder.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>Your organizer,<\/p>\n<p>Daniel Szyper<\/p>","lon":-74.4499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/2\/2\/highres_21532258.jpeg","photo_id":21532258,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/2\/2\/600_21532258.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/2\/2\/thumb_21532258.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":2920715,"name":"Daniel Szyper"},"members":197,"name":"Central NJ Aspies 4 Social Success Meetup Group","id":275098,"state":"NJ","urlname":"NJ-Aspies-4-Social-Success","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.4900016785,"who":"Adults with Asperger's Syndrome"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1151870803000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"redskins","name":"Washington Redskins","id":369}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-New-York-City-NYC-Washington-Redskins-Meetup-Group\/","rating":4.36,"description":"See the ''About Us'' page for details on Redskins bars in NYC.","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/0\/7\/9\/highres_5312889.jpeg","photo_id":5312889,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/0\/7\/9\/600_5312889.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/0\/7\/9\/thumb_5312889.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":4645103,"name":"Stroker"},"members":467,"name":"The New York City (NYC) Washington Redskins Meetup Group","id":275628,"state":"NY","urlname":"The-New-York-City-NYC-Washington-Redskins-Meetup-Group","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.7799987793,"who":"NYC Redskins Super Fans"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1151893652000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"cartoonists","name":"Cartoonists","id":397},{"urlkey":"webcomics","name":"Web Comics","id":750},{"urlkey":"indiepublish","name":"Indie Publishing","id":1604},{"urlkey":"illustration","name":"Illustration","id":10091},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"comics-and-novels","name":"Comics and Novels","id":19319},{"urlkey":"comic-artists","name":"Comic Artists","id":21260},{"urlkey":"digital-publishing","name":"Digital Publishing","id":25681},{"urlkey":"drawing-manga-and-anime","name":"Drawing Manga and Anime","id":739962},{"urlkey":"dynamic-action-models","name":"Dynamic Action Models","id":1086492},{"urlkey":"comic-book-mentoring","name":"Comic Book Mentoring","id":1086502},{"urlkey":"drawing-contests","name":"Drawing Contests","id":1086512},{"urlkey":"sequential-artists","name":"Sequential Artists","id":1086522},{"urlkey":"anatomy-for-artists","name":"Anatomy for Artists","id":1086542}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Dare2Draw\/","rating":4.64,"description":"<p><b>Here's a quick video intro to the Dare2Draw.<\/b> <br><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"embedded\" href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/uiCHNXI5yBY\">http:\/\/youtu.be\/uiCHNXI5yBY<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/d\/a\/8\/event_309228552.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>Welcome!<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the plan:<\/p>\n<p>Dare2Draw's main mission is to help provide networking, mentoring and promoting opportunities, along with resources, for artists of all levels, while raising money for artists in need, with the art done by our guests.

More details, including directions, are included in all our event descriptions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">We also organize some non-tennis events throughout the year to give our tennis members a chance to mingle during bad weather and to meet other cool people who might not play.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">We look forward to seeing you all, both on the courts and off!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">P.S.

EFT \u2013 Emotional Freedom Techniques \u2013 is most likely THE breakthrough therapy of our times.<\/p> \n<p>2)&nbsp; PsychoClarity - a rapid, effective means for developing a conscious healing and nurturing relationship with traumatized, immature, conflicted, dissociated aspects of the personality.&nbsp; Wholeness and integration of the personality is accomplished as the Higher Self is empowered to take charge of the person\u2019s life.&nbsp; Dis-identification with painful. limited aspects of the personality is achieved.<\/p> \n<p>3)&nbsp; Rohun Spiritual Psychotherapy - a spiritual and energy healing process for systematically purifying the chakras and aura.&nbsp; Consciousness is transformed and enlightened by gently releasing the stuck energies, negative consciousness, and trauma in the body-mind-spirit system.<\/p> \n<p>Individual and group exercises, and demonstrations will be offered to foster an experiential understanding of these methods.<\/p> \n<p><b><i>Dr. Jay Kantor<\/i><\/b> became interested in healing, metaphysics, and spirituality in the late 1960\u2019s,&nbsp;

If you live outside of Bay Ridge you are also welcome! &nbsp;Though most of our activities have taken place in Bay Ridge they are not limited to the area.

We understand you may have a busy schedule and your plans may change so make sure you change your RSVP, especially if it a time or space-sensitive event. We do keep track of \"no shows\". Guests are more than welcome to attend but please include them in your RSVP.<\/p> \n<p>Also, remember, when you make friends with people in the group, put in the effort to maintain the friendship.

The best way to get there is to take the C local (B on weekdays) to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>+++<\/p>\n<p><strong>OTHER SEASONS...<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

Have only the vaguest notion of what a soccer ball looks like. Just started playing recently, or haven't played since, like, one time in P.E. in sixth grade.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">Level 2<\/span><br>\n\n Not a TOTAL beginner, but not quite intermediate yet. Have played for a little while, or started learning a long time ago but rarely play. Still working on the basics and screw up a lot. Can sort of pass, but super slow or non-existent on the footwork. Still trying to figure out how to keep people from stealing the ball so easily.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">Level 3<\/span><br>\n\n More or less have the basics down, but just barely. Absolutely nothing fancy. Just really simple ball handling\/dribbling, slow but mostly accurate passing, shooting, etc. Maybe played a little in school but not college. Can head the ball if necessary, but who knows where it will go? Still learning. Prefer a slower game. Note: You are probably better than a level three if you have been playing on and off since childhood.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">Level 4<\/span><br>\n\n Solid player. Most people who learned to play as a kid are this level. Have been playing most of your life, on and off. Have ball handling skills, can head and switch the ball pretty comfortably, pass accurately most of the time. Maybe played on a few competitive leagues, or play a lot of pick up, and prefer a regular to fast-paced game.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">Level 5 (and up)<\/span><br>\n\n Very good player. Play often. \u00a0Have played since you were young. Maybe played competitive or club soccer. Dribble easily at a run, can head and switch the ball confidently. Enjoy a faster, fairly intense, physical game.<\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/1\/0\/highres_77058192.jpeg","photo_id":77058192,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/1\/0\/600_77058192.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/1\/0\/thumb_77058192.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":3550742,"name":"Monica-Lisa"},"members":2267,"name":"Prospect Park (Beginner + Intermediate) Pick-up Soccer","id":392218,"state":"NY","urlname":"prospect-park-soccer","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Learning Soccer Players"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1167602817000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"sailing","name":"Sailing","id":1176},{"urlkey":"boating","name":"Boating","id":8595},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"yachting","name":"Yachting","id":17436},{"urlkey":"water-sports","name":"Water Sports","id":17437},{"urlkey":"sailing-long-island-sound","name":"Sailing Long Island Sound","id":74932},{"urlkey":"learn-to-sail","name":"Learn to Sail","id":77742},{"urlkey":"sailing-lesson","name":"Sailing Lesson","id":77779},{"urlkey":"yacht-racing","name":"Yacht Racing","id":146599},{"urlkey":"sailboat-crew","name":"Sailboat Crew","id":146600},{"urlkey":"new-york-yacht-racing","name":"New York Yacht Racing","id":146611}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-New-York-Sailing-Group\/","rating":4.69,"description":"<p><span>\"If a man must be obsessed by something, I suppose a boat is as good as anything, and perhaps a bit better than most.

Solid turnout and strong reviews by attendees and musicians have all served as proof that the event is a welcome and valuable addition to the New York City social landscape. The Barn Dance is a fully participatory, traditional, social dance event, and attendees are invited to participate as dancers regardless of experience.<\/p>\n<p>The dances we do are old-time squares from southern Appalachia.\u00a0 People are friendly here and are willing to dance with each other, so there's no harm in coming alone.\u00a0 We make sure that everyone who wants to get out on the floor does so the whole night long!<\/p>\n<p>You should also know that we teach and walk-through all dances.\u00a0 The teaching is efficient because we all want to get on to the dancing!\u00a0 This event is a dance party, not a dance class!<\/p>\n<p>Come join us for a night of lively dancing to live music!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Yours,<\/p>\n<p>Dave Harvey<\/p>\n<p>Event Organizer<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/c\/7\/e\/highres_115600062.jpeg","photo_id":115600062,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/c\/7\/e\/600_115600062.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/c\/7\/e\/thumb_115600062.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3614686,"name":"David Harvey"},"members":730,"name":"NYC Barn Dance","id":403763,"state":"NY","urlname":"squaredance-4","category":{"name":"dancing","id":5,"shortname":"dancing"},"lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Barn Dancers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1168841013000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"wine","name":"Wine","id":611},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"singles-30s-50s","name":"Singles 30's-50's","id":16660},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Social\/","rating":4.82,"description":"<p><span><strong>Welcome to the largest &amp; most active&nbsp;NYC Social Group on Meetup with<\/strong><\/span>&nbsp;<b>10,00<\/b><span><strong>0+ Members!<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Join us if you are interested in meeting new people, making new friends, and having fun at various social gatherings.<\/strong><\/span> <span><strong>We also offer exclusive discounts to our members for special events. <br> <\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>All of our&nbsp;Meetups are well organized and well attended.&nbsp; We pride ourselves on putting together unique and quality&nbsp;events for our members.&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope you will join us and look forward to having you in our group.&nbsp; Thanks.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Please feel free to also&nbsp;visit and join our Facebook Page:<\/strong><\/span> <span><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/newyorkcitysocial\/\">http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/newyorkcitysocial\/<\/a><\/strong><\/span><\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/b\/a\/highres_330767802.jpeg","photo_id":330767802,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/b\/a\/600_330767802.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/b\/a\/thumb_330767802.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":4988418,"name":"Lou"},"members":11054,"name":"!

We also meet regularly for open traditional Irish seisiuns, including the Tuesday night seisiun at Dempsey's, the longest-running open seisiun in New York, providing an opportunity for musicians in our group to become more active in the seisiuns.

It is not meant to encourage &nbsp;militarism. The Men's Club is, in fact, a pacifist enterprise - even as men like Ernest Hemingway and Muhammad Ali were pacifists.&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Boxing is not practiced primarily for self-defense, but in the pursuit of a higher order of being, what was once referred to as <em>character-building<\/em>, in that boxing is the only human activity which claims to measure the better man, and that the practice of boxing makes one a better man, competition notwithstanding<\/strong><strong>.<\/strong> <span><strong>The self-defense aspect, while of considerable value, is simply an added benefit.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>To amplify, your organizer gives a short talk on <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hBaWHu6oMdc\">The Art of Boxing<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/span><strong><span><em>.<\/em><\/span> <span>For further clarification, read<\/span> <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.boxingarts.com\/\">A Commentary on Boxing and Culture<\/a><\/em><span>, also by your&nbsp;organizer.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>**Note: The word \"<em>hunter<\/em>\", noting the almost universally accepted definition of humans as being \"<em>hunter\/gatherers<\/em>\", refers to the hunting, gathering or harvesting of any and all natural, renewable resources (in, of course, a sustainable manner). The Men's Club avers that h<\/span><\/strong><strong>unting is by far, and without question, the most ecologically&nbsp;sound and&nbsp;<\/strong><span><strong>environmentally&nbsp;sustainable means of providing nourishment.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>It should be noted that all Men's Club activities (i.e. not only boxing) are designed to make one a better man. A builder grows to understand the nature of materials, how to work with his hands, what constitutes \"quality\" in all things man-made, and so on. Those things make him a better man.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><strong>A hunter learns about nature, ecology, self-reliance and the interconnectedness of all living things. All of this makes him a better man ... and so on ... ... ...&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>:: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;::<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>The philosophy of the Men's Club<\/strong> is based on the fact that the human genetic endowment has remained virtually unchanged for more than two million years, that it is the direct result of our engagement with physical reality via the five senses; that our every thought and action derives from that fact; that that is a good thing, and that the only path toward maximum personal development is through increasing and intensifying said engagement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In addition, engagement with physical reality stimulates changes in epigenetic activity which results in incremental, marginal changes in perception and behavior, all of which enhances the human life experience. These changes then result in changes in genetic activity; though whether or not behaviorally-induced epigenetic transformations effect structural changes to the human genome is still undetermined. Still, any man who develops even rudimentary skills in all of the subject areas of study of <i>The Men's Club<\/i> will be a profoundly different human being than one who has none.<\/p>\n<p><span>Furthermore, various and seemingly unrelated human activities share common components and are often mutually enhancing and reinforcing. Dancing, for example, helps develop the balance that is so important in boxing, which, in turn, heightens the sensory perception that is so important in hunting. Hunting and gathering educate the practitioner in those qualities inherent in natural resources which make them useful, whether for food or crafts-work. Everything is interrelated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/1\/1\/event_432346609.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><em>\"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.

You can have joy by making room for all of this to happen. To be willing to be with and experience the ups and downs of life. Life is a roller coaster, and is never a striaght line. Going through, and working with our emotions (ironically) is the only way to get past them. Unfortunately, we (human beings) hardly ever do that. Instead, we eat too much, we drink too much, we never have enough sex, we watch too much TV, we take drugs, we smoke, we neglect our responsibilities, we pretend it's not happening, etc... anything to get away from our socalled negative emotions.<\/p>\n<p>Joy is not having to avoid our feelings, or people, or places. Joy is being able to embrace life with all its complexities. Until we learn to do this, life will continuously shrink us, and as we age, it will only get worse.

Looking for a little bit of adult conversation?  Enjoy reading?  Then this Meetup group is for you.  I am a former high school English teacher who has decided to leave the school classroom for a bit to stay home.  I enjoy being home, but I found I really missed talking about books with people.  That was the initial impetus for starting the group.  I also needed to read something more advanced than Dr. Seuss to ward off brain atrophy (ha ha).

This group is for people of all skill levels and of all kayaking types (recreational, touring, whitewater, surfing, etc.). We meet regularly for sea-kayaking in Stamford, Greenwich, and Rowayton, but also plan meetups in other areas, both on the Long Island Sound and inland in freshwater locations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you are a beginner, this is the place to start. You will meet others who can give you advice before you buy any gear. If you are an experienced paddler, this group is an ideal way to meet other paddlers to talk about gear, local paddle spots, and to plan trips. Kayakers of all levels are welcome!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>SKG\u00a0is a forum and a social network, not a club, training\u00a0facility, or\u00a0outfitter. All events are\u00a0common adventures, are<\/span> <strong>non-autocratic<\/strong> in nature, and not for profit (unless hosted specifically by a\u00a0business, institution, or outfitter following a different liability model). SKG, its organizers, and its members assume no legal and or civil responsibility for or to any individual or event.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span>We Encourage Safe Paddling<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>We suggest that everyone paddle in a pod of three or more for safety reasons.\u00a0The forum makes it possible for novice, intermediate, and advanced kayakers to find each other and form safe paddle pods.\u00a0The social nature of the group allows members to\u00a0share\u00a0safety tips and skills in a non-structured friendly format. \u00a0We also try to send information to the group about safe kayaking tips and training. \u00a0Occasionally we might have an event just to share and practice (but the group is not a certified kayak training school, vendor, etc). \u00a0Safety is your responsibility!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>How We Set Up Events<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>SKG is not a leader-dictated Meetup group, but a member-driven forum.\u00a0Kayakers are welcome to join the forum and suggest locations for common-adventure paddles.\u00a0 All members can suggest a place, date, and time for a kayak event.\u00a0 In fact, SKG relies heavily on individual members to put events on the calendar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>You can schedule member-originated common-adventure paddles<\/span> in the following ways:<\/p>\n<p><span>Whenever you visit the SKG Meetup page<\/span>, you will see \u201c<strong>+ SUGEST A NEW MEETUP<\/strong>\u201d just below the word \u201c<strong>Welcome<\/strong>\u201d\u2026 this is the mechanism for scheduling member-originated common-adventure paddles.\u00a0 Click here and you will be taken to a form that will prompt you to type in the event name, place, date, time, and details for your suggested meetup.\u00a0 In the details please describe the type of water (protected, open-water, white-water, etc.) and be very specific about the\u00a0kayak type, skill level, and pace of your suggested paddle (just so others know what to expect of you and the paddle).<\/p>\n<p><span>Alternately, you can view others SUGGESTED events to see if there is a suggested event that you might want to attend.<\/span> Often a member will throw out an idea but not include any details.\u00a0 You can expand on their suggestion by specifying place, date, time, and details (including type of water) for the suggestion.<\/p>\n<p><span>SUGGESTED events become UPCOMING events when two other members decide to attend, making the minimum three person paddle pod. The suggestion moves to the calendar and is announced to the group as an Upcoming event.<\/span> Sometimes when an event is complete (i.e. name, place, date, time, and details are provided) one of\u00a0the\u00a0SKG moderators\u00a0will announced it to the group with less than three people on the RSVP list to get the word out to all members sooner.\u00a0\u00a0We will not announce suggestions without the basic details.<\/p>\n<p><span>Once it is on the calendar your idea is no longer a suggestion, but an event and it gets announced to the group by e-mail. \u00a0Whenever you visit the SKG Meetup page<\/span><span>,<\/span> <span>you should check the SUGGESTED events page to see if there is a suggested event that you might want to attend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Many people worry that if they suggest a paddle too many kayakers will show up and they would be\u00a0responsible\u00a0for a large group. \u00a0Most of the SKG<\/span> <span>e<\/span><span>vents attract about 1% of the members, which is about 3 to 6 kayakers.\u00a0That is just the right size for a group paddle. \u00a0Members just need to be specific on the day, time, and place (as well as kayak type, skill level, etc.) when making a suggestion. \u00a0The events are common adventures, so you are not\u00a0responsible\u00a0for others, just yourself, but there is always safety in numbers. \u00a0However, you should be very specific about the\u00a0kayak type, skill level, and pace (protected, open-water, white-water, etc.)\u00a0of your suggested paddle. \u00a0It is not a good idea for kayakers of a single pod<\/span> <span>to have<\/span> <span>a mixed expectation of the paddle... it just leads to\u00a0disappointment\u00a0and a paddle pod break down. \u00a0In short, be clear in your suggestion\u00a0description\u00a0and others with like<\/span><span>-minded<\/span> <span>thinking will join you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>SKG wants all its members to feel free to make paddle event suggestions.\u00a0Such suggestions can be sit-on-top novice paddles in protected waters (i.e. lakes and marshes), intermediate-level day paddles, or advanced-skill sea-kayak paddles. Anyone can take the initiative to add paddle events to the calendar as discribed above...\u00a0And, this is the best way to get events that work for your personal schedule and skill level so you never have to paddle alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><br>\n\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Please read the\u00a0The Stamford Kayak Group disclaimer:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/StamfordKayakGroup\/messages\/boards\/thread\/3398196\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/StamfordKayakGroup\/messages\/boards\/thread\/3398196\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/StamfordKayakGroup\/messages\/boards\/thread\/3398196<\/a><\/p>","lon":-73.5199966431,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/1\/3\/9\/highres_3889465.jpeg","photo_id":3889465,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/1\/3\/9\/600_3889465.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/1\/3\/9\/thumb_3889465.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3701751,"name":"Peter"},"members":1062,"name":"The Stamford Kayaking Meetup Group","id":506423,"state":"CT","urlname":"StamfordKayakGroup","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":41.0900001526,"who":"Kayakers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Oakland","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1179692401000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"couples","name":"Couples","id":3250},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/women-375\/","rating":4.74,"description":"Longtime resident or brand-new, the Oakland Newcomers & Neighbors Club welcomes you!

We welcome all of you to join us and have a good time at our events.<\/p>\n<p>I want to take this opportunity to THANK our Founder \"DON\" from the BRONX known warmly by our group as \"DONNIE BASEBALL\" for all that he's done since he started this meetup group in the Summer of 2007. Don showed his generosity during the 1st 3 summers &amp; I commend him for all that he gave to the group. Good luck Don in whatever you do next and we hope to see you occasionally in OG's.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, I want to recognize CARLOS-V for his loyalty, dedication and hard work each and every Sunday since July 2007 preparing for games and clearing up all the equipment at the conclusion of the day. Carlos is our field general extraordinaire and should be commended and respected for all of the selfless efforts he makes for this meetup group.<\/p>\n<p>During that summer of 2007, my first experience was meeting DonY, BillyM, MikeA &amp; CarlosV in July, all of whom I say with pleasure are still somewhat active in this group. It was softball and free pizza @ PS 46 off Springfield Blvd.<\/p>\n<p>Jack \"The Glove\" - stepped up the following year (2008) and created weekday meetups for \"PRACTICE\" that many of our members enjoyed attending and have gotten better as a result. Honorable Mention goes to JohnM and JamesY who all assisted Jack in his week night meetups.<\/p>\n<p>Emily - \"Everyone loves Emmy\" in 2008 became our group's true blue : cheerleader, fan, player &amp; glue!

Thank you Captain for your tireless efforts and love of people and sports.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to our softball meets, we have hosted bowling &amp; pool (non swimming) parties during the off season as our group has become tighter and friendships have blossomed throughout the year.<\/p>\n<p>I want to reiterate - that this meetup group is strictly for fun. As competitive as I am personally, I think the core group knows that it's all about having a good time when you attend our events.<\/p>\n<p>There should be absolutely no place for disruptive behavior, arguments &amp; fights, and the organizers and assistants will not tolerate them. Let's all act maturely and I guarantee we'll get along.

Please note this will be used for miscellaneous meetup membership fees, permits, equipment as needed and social events we host during the Summer &amp; Fall i.e. BBQ's Pizza Birthday, Wine &amp; Cheese Parties etc.<\/p>\n<p>We meet generally in one of the following 3 fields:<\/p>\n<p>1) PS 213 Carl Ullman School (usually when it rains the days preceeding a meetup date) <br> <br> 2) Peck Field -

Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned professional, an intermediate hobbyist, or a complete beginner hoping to get your feet wet; whether your focus is rock, pop, classical, Broadway, Jazz, R&amp;B&hellip;there will be an event designed specifically for you.<\/p>\r\n<p>Our primary purpose is to have fun becoming better singers; to improve together as vocal artists and performers beyond where we are at present. The &ldquo;how&rdquo; depends largely on our current level of proficiency, our current levels of training and experience, and where our interests lie.<\/p>\r\n<p>That is why each event will be geared towards different singers with different goals. Some events will be designed for beginners looking to get their feet wet among friends. Some will be for seasoned professionals to work on specific sticking points in their technique, delivery, etc.  Some will be for intermediate singers who just want to have fun with other singers, in a non-intimidating climate, honing their voices and craft.<\/p>\r\n<p>Events will include, but will not be limited to:<\/p>\r\n<p>&bull; Fun outings to open-mic events, karaoke nights, jams, and other venues for public singing among peers.<\/p>\r\n<p>&bull; Group vocal lessons, clinics, and workshops, focusing on everything from proper warm-ups, breathing, ear training, resonance and range expansion, to conquering stage fright, song interpretation, audition preparation, vocal improvisation, or even specific &ldquo;sticking points&rdquo; some of us might collectively want to work through together.<\/p>\r\n<p>&bull; Group members&rsquo; gigs\/performances:  a great way to gain motivation and learn is to support your peers as they perform in their individual projects (artists supporting each other can be invaluable!).<\/p>\r\n<p>Note from the group&rsquo;s moderator:<\/p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been a private vocal instructor for over 15 years now, and a professional singer for most of my life. I love the act and art of singing, and over the years, I&rsquo;ve developed a true fondness and affinity for helping others develop into the singers they want to be. That is why I chose to start this group.<\/p>\r\n<p>THE IMPORTANT THING:  I want to hear FROM YOU. What kinds of outings would you be interested in? What are some of your goals as singers? What sorts of techniques and topics would you like to see group lessons, clinics, and workshops cover? Please, send me an email and let's discuss some ideas!<\/p>\r\n<p>This is your group. Let&rsquo;s mold it together into something really cool, and really special; something that helps us all evolve together as singers, performers, and artists, while having fun doing it.

Let's get some friendly matches going!<\/p>\n<p>I do my level best to meet, greet and match up new &amp; returning members to insure a good outing of tennis.<\/p>\n<p>I am always looking for like minded\/dedicated individuals that would serve as assistant organizers &amp; event hosts to enhance our group's ability to put out additional meetup events or services for our members.<\/p>\n<p>Join our meetup events by RSVP'g \"YES\".

We are dedicated teachers and students of A <em>Course in Miracles<\/em> (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM-based Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in all areas of your life. Bring any issue you are facing right now \u2014 physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, or whatever \u2014 or just bring your shining spirit, and receive a short session of energy work.<\/p>\n<p>You will experience healing by the Holy Spirit through our healers' hands. Together, we create a Holy Triangle, consisting of the Holy Spirit and two brothers (you and a healer), to be the witnesses of miracles together. Together, we can help each other to accept God\u2019s love! After your healing we might whisper to you a brief message that we receive from the Holy Spirit about what is going on in your energy field. Otherwise, we don't talk or discuss ACIM during this meetup event. We share healing quietly instead and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p>\n<p>So, rather than offering your advice, we'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project. We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Schedule:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mondays from 7 \u2013 7:50 pm<br>\n\nTuesdays from 7 \u2013 7:50 pm<br>\n\nThursdays from 11 \u2013 11:50 am\u00a0<br>\n\nSuggested donation $20.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014 <em>A Course in Miracles<\/em> Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/5\/1\/e\/highres_18249502.jpeg","photo_id":18249502,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/5\/1\/e\/600_18249502.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/5\/1\/e\/thumb_18249502.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":4797971,"name":"Yasuko Kasaki"},"members":903,"name":"Walk-In Spiritual Healing Clinic","id":622378,"state":"NY","urlname":"ACIM-healing","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"friends"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1187239055000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"ebizowners","name":"E-Business Owners","id":1330},{"urlkey":"freelance","name":"Freelance","id":9876},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/web2fem\/","rating":4.76,"description":"We are a network of women entrepreneurs looking to expand and explore our roles in the evolving stage of Web 2.0.
