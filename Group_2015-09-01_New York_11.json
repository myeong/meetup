A Course in Miracles is a complete self-study spiritual thought system based on universal spiritual themes.

For the purpose of shared reading, we recommend that members bring the book titled, A Course in Miracles, Published by the Foundation for Inner Peace, Combined Volume.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0The Course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love's presence, which is your natural inheritance. This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way: Nothing real can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists.

Background: This past&nbsp;spring I was fortunate enough to serve as a teaching assistant&nbsp;for the extraordinary poet and distinguished professor Kimiko Hahn in a newly conceived Queens College graduate level course for NYC public school teachers. The course was specifically designed for those interested in writing poetry and short stories. It was an outstanding experience and the good&nbsp;results in the 14 week course were wonderful to see. I want to keep the concept alive and more: create a poetry writing community for educators that&nbsp;focuses on their personal experience and relationships&nbsp;with learning and U.S. education.&nbsp;Please consider giving this writing circle a try&nbsp;for sanity's sake as you continue to bang your head up against that imposing Common Core wall. <strong>[The first group <\/strong><strong>is for beginning poets only; a second group for practicing and emerging poets to follow. Please scroll down for more details.]<\/strong> <br>&nbsp; <br><strong> About the DTCP workshops:<\/strong>&nbsp; <br>They are&nbsp;designed for NYC public school teachers and others who are serious about learning to write poetry and\/or microfiction and enjoy meaningful conversations along with building&nbsp;strong learning communities. Prior experience with poetry is not needed: just having a strong interest and willingness to write regularly will do. Indeed, anyone who has never considered writing poetry at all for whatever reason(s) is welcomed. These workshops are intended to be low-pressure participant-centered and very supportive. I'm looking for sincere and kind individuals who will take an interest in the learning and well-being of others as well as their own. Using selected readings and facilitated dialogue we will explore craft elements; possibilities for revisions;&nbsp;the individual's creative writing process; a variety of themes&nbsp;related to education; and other objects of knowledge. The ultimate goal is to&nbsp;build a supportive and inspiring community for poet&nbsp;educators that engenders creativity and original poetry. The locations for a projected two or more separate groups will be easily accessible in Manhattan, Brooklyn, or Queens; please participate in the location poll. There is a modest fee of $5 for each 1 \u00bd to 2 hour weekly session (pay in advance or as you go), with a series ending dinner, group reading, and poetry chapbook give-away&nbsp;for interested participants included.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <br>Based on early member feedback, the first scheduled group&nbsp;is designed for poets and writers who have little to no experience writing poetry.&nbsp;Mixing&nbsp;teachers who have taught poetry at the high school and\/or college level together with less experienced writers could present problems.&nbsp;For the more experienced members&nbsp;who&nbsp;have responded, please send your&nbsp;best days\/times to see about beginning&nbsp;another group. <br> <br>So, if you are a teacher with little experience writing and teaching poetry, or simply someone interested in&nbsp;U.S. education and&nbsp;writing poetry, then this first group is for you. <br> <br>If you do have experience, please stay in touch; send days and times that would work for you and we will gather a critical mass of interested participants to start a group for more experienced poets and writers. <br> <br>Please let me know if you have any questions. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><strong> About the organizer:<\/strong> Andr\u00e9s Castro fell in love with poetry during a&nbsp;curiously meandering&nbsp;career path that included teaching tennis;&nbsp;counseling and academic advisement;&nbsp;Met Museum of Art special security; a two-year (and change) stint with&nbsp;the NYC Teaching Fellows; traveling around the country&nbsp;on the U.S. Dept. of Education Even Start Classroom Literacy Intervention Outcome (CLIO) Study; and other jobs.

After starting a job in management consulting, I found it difficult to consistently attend any existing running group sessions, as most did not accommodate my unique working hours. I tend to hit the pavement by 6am for morning runs, an after 8pm for post-work runs. I also live and work in the financial district, and have found few groups who meet in my neighborhood. This group will meet rather early or late, depending on the day, for group runs at moderate (weekend warrior) pace runs. We will run primarily out-and-back and loop runs that start and end in the financial district, and can be more creative on weekend runs.

But we also need YOU, to bring your background and point of view. This MeetUp is not meant to answer all the questions and solidify the solutions, rather its purpose is to foster the conversations and facilitate discussions around the topics.<\/p>\n<p>If you're an entrepreneur, tech professional, or anyone genuinely interested how technology will affect society, this MeetUp is an opportunity to listen and learn, exchange ideas and network with liked-minded individuals.<\/p>\n<p>We hope you will join us.

I want to build strong friendships, have fun with people who feel comfortable around each other, and provide an ample shoulder to lean on when times get tough. THIS GROUP IS NOT FOR BBW ADMIRERS!! This group is for plus sized women who want to do the following with each other: - shopping... at stores where clothes fit us! - fun outings... where the activity level fits our needs and abilities! - movies... with people who understand that we need a seat in between each other, and don't feel weird about it! - dinner out... without anyone looking at your plate and wondering if you should \"really be eating that!\" - fitness...without judgement, at a pace and level that works for each person! - FEEL FREE TO BE 100% WHO WE ARE AROUND EACH OTHER!

Non-denominational and undogmatic, the worldwide Oneness Blessing phenomenon attracts  participants of all ages from all walks of life and beliefs (or non-beliefs) who bond over  a common desire for something more in life. \n\nThe blessing is a brief, light laying on of hands of subtle energies transmitted by Oneness Blessing Givers that initiate a neurophysical change in the brain, declutching the mind and quieting inner chatter and divisiveness. Participants experience deep inner peace and expansiveness during the process, resulting in growing clarity, inner peace, self-acceptance, personal breakthroughs, and miracles. \n\nThe evening includes a chakra meditation to raise kundalini (energy) and a discussion or Q&A period.

We hope to bring business leaders, teachers, successful freelancers and much more who can help get you in the right mindset and guide you with the right tools to be more financially independent and set yourself up for beyond your years in school.<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/f\/c\/highres_434228956.jpeg","photo_id":434228956,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/f\/c\/600_434228956.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/f\/c\/thumb_434228956.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":184309468,"name":"Tek Kim"},"members":53,"name":"Student Side Hustlers","id":18423750,"state":"NY","urlname":"Student-Side-Hustlers","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Side Hustlers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Newark","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423529046000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"african-dance","name":"African Dance","id":15079},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"dance-lessons","name":"Dance Lessons","id":19146},{"urlkey":"african-drumming","name":"African Drumming","id":20732},{"urlkey":"west-african-drumming","name":"West African Drumming","id":28750},{"urlkey":"african-culture","name":"African Culture","id":35648},{"urlkey":"dance-african-dance-and-drumming","name":"Dance: African Dance and Drumming","id":49751},{"urlkey":"west-african-dance-and-drum","name":"West African Dance and Drum","id":106702},{"urlkey":"west-african-dance","name":"West African Dance","id":121920},{"urlkey":"west-african-drum","name":"West African Drum","id":133886}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Newark-West-African-Dance-Meetup\/","rating":4.33,"description":"<p>This class is for anyone who loves to dance!

Also, we need to expand our horizons and we welcome participation from others. On occasion we \"meetup\" for events: this past month for example, attended Martha Graham Dance Co. performance\u2014modern dance is an unusual art form-- \u201ctakes one's mind far away. \u201d We attend music, and theatre events, mostly off or off-off B'way, and lectures. Our last was a lecture on Feb 22, at the SVA Theatre (333 W. 23rd) on the subject of energy. Later, we meet for \u201ccoffee,\u201d for discussion. We have endorsements from NASA scientists for a vital music discovery that we\u2019ve turned into a play, theatre\/music piece\u2014with potential positive ramifications. This segment is called: \"Translators of the Universe.\" The content is new to the music industry, but also includes innovative ideas for living. We meet in the West 80's or at Nola Studios on W. 54th. Prior to 12\/31\/14 we met at Steinway Hall, as many know the Steinwway company has moved. We convene 2-3 times a week to move our project forward. We are hoping to augment our team with people who have interest in classical music, theatre, and healthy living. We meet to exchange ideas that might enhance the project, have dinner, and involves a social meetup. I thought the MeetUp group might infuse energy into our project. Having volunteered for Musica Sacra (choral music), the U.N. and other organizations, we model our meetings to include a healthy dinner while brain-storming ideas for a national release of our passion, Breaking The Rules. The cast includes 3, but we do also need actors who can step in, and lots of participation from a committee. Our group and ideas are exciting, and hope you\u2019ll consider joining our fun, meetups, and efforts. Every summer we go on a retreat. Last summer to Nantucket summer of \u201913 the Adirondacks. I know the description does not explain everything, however, should you have interest please see our site.

We will meet on a regular basis over coffee to introduce ourselves, learn something about chinese food, culture and business, and share our experiences learning chinese. This group is fit for people who already have some basic knowledge of mandarin, which means you can already speak a little bit of mandarin.

BubbleBall guarantees to make you spin, bounce and laugh like no other sport in history!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>What is Bubble Ball Soccer?<\/p>\n<p>Bubble soccer (also known as \u201cBoblefotball\u201d \"bubble football\" \"bumperz\" and \"bubble ball\") is the brainchild of Henrik Elvestad and Johan Goldenfirst. The first game appeared on&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xIl45f6i1PU\"><i>Golden Goal<\/i><\/a>, a Norwegian TV show, in 2011. Since then it has rapidly spread like wildfire throughout the world and finally, Bubble Ball Soccer has landed in NYC (the tri-state area).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To play, teams of up to ten players don typical soccer\/sports clothing and put their giant bubble ball suits (loosely described as giant, inflatable hamster balls) on top. Each suit is very safe and is designed for any type of weather or outdoor arena.They have a built in backpack style harness so you can strap the balls on, and handles to allow for pain free spills, hard tackling, bumping, knocking, bouncing and rolling.<\/p>\n<p>Don't worry though, you won't get a yellow card for this type of behavior. Bubble ball soccer is a full contact sport and there are no tackling fouls to be heard of. Roughhousing is actually encouraged and&nbsp;what makes bubble ball soccer so much fun! The balls will absorb the tackle and do what it does best, bounce back and bring you to&nbsp;your feet without causing you any harm, pain or injury!<\/p>\n<p>So, what are the actual rules? Simple - keep the balls in bounds and score! This is a lot harder than it looks (actually it doesn't look easy at all) and as a result most games end up with only a few goals. Despite this fact, it's still a very entertaining game to watch and even more fun to play. Expect to&nbsp;burn up to 1000&nbsp;calories, sweat, laugh, get some aggression out and experience withdrawal symptoms until your next round!<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/highres_440702134.jpeg","photo_id":440702134,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/600_440702134.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/thumb_440702134.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":273759,"name":"camille"},"members":66,"name":"NYC Bubble Ball","id":18427171,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Bubble-Ball","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Bubble Ballers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423656423000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"publicspeaking","name":"Public Speaking","id":9300},{"urlkey":"business-coaching","name":"Business Coaching","id":12669},{"urlkey":"leadership","name":"Leadership","id":15121},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"presentations","name":"Presentations","id":16223},{"urlkey":"personal-development","name":"Personal Development","id":16468},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"communication-skills","name":"Communication Skills","id":20923},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"fear-of-public-speaking","name":"Fear of Public Speaking","id":42862},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Speech-Party-Speed-Learn-Public-Speaking-for-Busy-People\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>We are on a mission to save the world from boring presentations.&nbsp; Like Steve Jobs, Warren Buffet, and Richard Branson we know how important public speaking can be to our professional and personal success.&nbsp; But similar to sleeping and eating, our busy schedules don't always allow us to devote enough time to it.&nbsp; The goal of Speech Partiers is to make public speaking fun and to hack the learning process.&nbsp; We do activities inspired by both the power of neuroscience and the power of crowdsourcing to speed up our progress.&nbsp; Welcome to the party!&nbsp; <\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/7\/f\/8\/highres_434226136.jpeg","photo_id":434226136,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/7\/f\/8\/600_434226136.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/7\/f\/8\/thumb_434226136.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":114208432,"name":"Shannon"},"members":211,"name":"Speech Party: Busy People Speed-Learn Public Speaking","id":18427559,"state":"NY","urlname":"Speech-Party-Speed-Learn-Public-Speaking-for-Busy-People","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Speech Partiers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423670840000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"witi","name":"Women in Technology","id":10296},{"urlkey":"technology","name":"Technology","id":10579},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"bootstrap","name":"Bootstrap","id":19373},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"android-developers","name":"Android Development","id":20346},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"html5","name":"HTML5","id":78565},{"urlkey":"ios-development","name":"iOS Development","id":127567},{"urlkey":"women-in-tech","name":"Women in tech","id":220771},{"urlkey":"swift-language","name":"Swift Language","id":1486112}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Free-Tech-Training-For-Women-In-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Training for Employment in an Executive or Computer Professional Capacity<\/p>\n<p>You start out as Exempt from Dues.

All our members know that our club is the best place you can learn communication and leadership skills in both English and Japanese. We have accomplished the \"Distinguished Toastmasters Club Award\" 5 years in a row. This award is given by Toastmasters International to the clubs that accomplished at least 5 of its specified goals. Not only is our club effective, but it is so much fun that it\u2019s addictive! Our membership is open to anyone who is interested in improving their public speaking skills in a culturally diverse environment. We meet in mid-town Manhattan twice a month, and in each meeting, we run two sessions; first in English and then in Japanese. However, you do not need to speak Japanese and you are very welcome to participate in the English session only. Our club provides a friendly and supportive environment where you can build up confidence with each speaking assignment. By regularly presenting a speech in front of like-minded professionals, you will soon find yourself speaking in a more relaxed and confident manner to the board of directors, to your customers or even in job interviews! Feel free to join us as a guest and see for yourself how it works.

Mastermind groups offer a combination of brainstorming, education, peer accountability, and support in a group setting to sharpen your business and personal skills.

Each lady will take a turn and speak about what she is working on, goals, and with what she needs help.

Then for the next 20-30 minutes, the rest of us will brainstorm, share ideas, solutions, and constructive feedback towards a solution for her. Each lady will feel free to share as much or as little as she wants. This will not be a \"woe is me\" session and every lady will be safe to share herself without fear of being attacked or made to feel ridiculous. <br><\/p>\n<p>Kindness above all else is our most valued principle. <br><\/p>\n<p>After the meeting is over, we can leave, or just chat and get to know each other.

SONW is very beneficial for people of all ages even for seniors. SONW is beneficial for those who both in ill and good health.<\/p>\n<p><span><b>We do not walk properly<\/b><\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>All of the known benefits from these various researches are only a minor part of the true benefits we can achieve from walking. The true benefits have not yet been achieved because most people still do not walk properly. <br> <br>What\u2019s the proof? Look at the soles of your shoes, for most people the left and right soles are worn out unequally. Measure the size of your calves. For most people, the shape and size may not be the same because they do not use both sides of their body equally. This is why, what should naturally happen when we take each step cannot happen properly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Natural Healing Abilities<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Our body is specially designed and created. A grazed skin or a broken bone can naturally mend itself. Our body is equipped with countless natural healing abilities.

When girls have no pads, they often remain in isolation a week a month, while they are bleeding, missing valuable school days. Adding days and years to a girls education prevents many negative outcomes: human trafficking, rape, fistulas, conflict in regions, maternal death rate and more. We have over 250 \"Days for Girls\" chapters in 14 countries making sustainable feminine hygiene products. We have aided girls in over 70 countries with roughly 200,000 menstrual kits. We are hosting a training in Manhattan 3\/12, Thurs 9am-6pm. Our founder, Celeste Mergens, who is based in WA, will be in NYC this March to speak at the UN at the Global Summit on the Status of Women. Please join us for this great opportunity to train with Celeste, who is a global expert on women\u2019s rights and practical solutions. By the end of the day you will be a certified Ambassador of Women's Health. Supplied with everything you need to know to educate a girl about her body, menstruation and self defense. All aspects of class are taught with awareness for cultural sensitivities and to best support the girls. This is a great seminar for anyone working or desiring to work in relief\/aid or education anywhere domestically or internationally.All backgrounds welcome. You will laugh and cry but leave uplifted when you learn you can do something to aid women in the world. This day will be way better than you are even expecting it to be right now!

We have two families who recently have moved into the city to share our love with the people here. We originated as a result of day trips into the city for a number of years to share the light of the gospel. As we made acquaintances here, they requested a church where we could meet together. We started out as a one Sunday a month Bible study and as more interest grew we became a local body of believers with church services every Sunday and some services in the week. In June of 2014 we moved a pastor into the Bronx. Our congregation consists of the two families here, two families and some youth who drive in from Pennsylvania, and a number of dedicated people from the city. A personal note from the pastor:<br>Hi there! I am Tim. I was born in 1976. My brother (my co-pastor) and I are in the middle of six children. Today of those six, two are missionaries in Honduras, two of us are involved in the church plant here in the Bronx, and two are settled in Pennsylvania.

I like to try to get out of town (and even out of the country) once or twice a year. Traveling on our own gets lonely - teenagers, especially, are really much happier when they have the company of other kids\/young people. So we have been experimenting with group travel. So far, we've taken one tour designed for families, and are planning to take two others in the coming year. While the tour we took was quite good in some ways, it would have been better if there were more families like ours (the tour was mainly composed of large extended family groups with two parents, grandparents, etc.). I thought it might be nice to gather other single parents (meaning single, divorced, or widowed - anyone traveling as one parent with one or more children) facing the same trip planning issues and share our experiences and maybe even - if it really works out - figuring out how to join up for group travel. I'm not interested in camping or low-budget type of tours, so I specified \"high-end\" (meaning very good tour group, really good accommodations, etc.). So we'll have to see who signs up. If there's interest, maybe we can then set up a meeting somewhere and talk over coffee or brunch and see where it goes from there. Depending on what's most convenient, if we do meet, we can do it somewhere that's centrally located in the Greater New York area (maybe in Manhattan).<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":131857822,"name":"Marthe"},"members":81,"name":"Single Parents Interested in High-End Family Group Travel","id":18469538,"state":"NY","urlname":"Single-Parents-Interested-in-High-End-Family-Group-Travel","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Single parents looking to travel"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425235263000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"online-marketing","name":"Online Marketing","id":15585},{"urlkey":"affiliate-marketing","name":"Affiliate Marketing","id":15899},{"urlkey":"pay-per-click","name":"Pay Per Click","id":17602},{"urlkey":"cpa-marketing","name":"CPA Marketing","id":20233},{"urlkey":"facebook-marketing","name":"Facebook Marketing","id":66499},{"urlkey":"affiliate-marketing-ecommerce","name":"Affiliate Marketing (Ecommerce)","id":141895}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-City-Affiliate-Marketing-Meetup\/","rating":4.5,"description":"This is a group for AFFILIATE MARKETERS ONLY.

Most activities are comp but may ask for a small fee for organization. Transportation for 6 individuals ( mom and one preteen preferable) may be provided depending on location availability. After each meeting there will be Preteens Get Togethers Rock packages for a very small fee of $5 available for moms and daughters to interact together and to give mom pointers of how to deal with our Preteens even when we are not meeting, which is very beneficial for our Preteens. We will meet once a week, possibly on the weekends for I know weekdays are hard for some working moms.

Included in the first $10 fee will be a #2 pencil, eraser and your first sheet of paper to start your first drawing.  Eventually, you should get a #4 drawing pencil from Michael's or any other craft or art supply store you have nearby.  Suggested paper:  Strathmore, Windpower smooth Bristol, 14\" x 17\", 15 sheet, 100 lb. pad of paper.  \n\nVikki Anderson has had many art shows throughout the years in the tri-state area.  Her mediums are watercolor, acrylic and oil.  She uses interwoven paper in much of her artwork, but has become fascinated with drawing over the past five years and has had drawn many wonderful subjects including scenery, birds, pets and various stone images.  She has taught art in local libraries and now wishes to teach art in her home for those who truly want to give pencil drawing a chance.

It was one of the steps to a total and significant overhaul of my life. I decided to take greater responsibility for my body, soul, and mind. I was very conflicted in my heart; I liked my relaxed hair, but I realized that the chemicals in the relaxers were not good for the health issues I had. Since I did not know what direction to take, I spent one week praying and journaling my prayers, thoughts, and any answers that God had given me. After a week, the answer was obvious; I needed to change my hair care routine.&nbsp;There were three steps I took to turn things around.<\/p>\n<p>The first step of my natural hair journey was to educate myself on natural African textured hair. I had a relaxer for 25 years of my then 36 years of life, so I had no idea how to even take care of my REAL TEXTURED hair. I followed natural hair blogs, watched natural hair YouTube videos, and read books and articles.<\/p>\n<p>The next step was to stop relaxing my hair. At first this was easy, but one year into it and I was rocking an Erykah Badu African wrap-up EVERYDAY!! My wash routine (which started the night before) would sometimes take over 3 hours and consisted of pre-shampooing, washing, deep conditioning, washing, moisturizing, sealing, and protective styling. This took a lot of time and gallons of water. I had to stop swimming, water aerobics and doing serious cardio in the gym because the so-called natural products would run down my face and burn my eyes.<\/p>\n<p>Last step I took was to I made 14 satin pillow cases and sleep bonnets. You all know us beautiful colored girls HAVE to tie our hair up at night with satin scarves or hair bonnets, sleep on satin pillow cases and wear satin scarves in the winter to protect our edges and keep moisture in. Well, you also know that satin hair bonnets, don\u2019t always stay on our heads at night, so sometimes I\u2019d wake up with product on my face.<\/p>\n<p>HAIR PRODUCTS were the hardest thing ever. I spent lots of money and had various brands of so-called natural products. At first it would work and then it would stop, as if my hair was saying, \u201cYo, chick, I\u2019m over this! Next!\u201d I battled with lots of end knots, dryness, and split ends. My hair was growing but I could never leave it out because it would dry up so fast. I would have to saturate my hair over and over again with moisturizers. My biggest concern at that point was that it would eventually seep down my face and into my eyes. I hated that, so I did some more research on products I could use. Last year, I finally decided to go \u201cDo-It-Yourself\u201d for my hair. I was basically DIY for almost everything except my makeup (which is my 2015 goal)! I was a bit nervous, but with God\u2019s help, I found amazing recipes and ingredients to use.<\/p>\n<p>This opened up a new world of hair care products to me. I felt more in control and I felt confident. I controlled what I used in my hair because I made it. This was so exciting, and I made many different combinations of things. My motto was that I should be able to ingest anything I put on my skin and in my hair. My hair products consisted a combination of Young Living Essential Oils (Lavender, Rosemary, Lemon, Geranium, Cedar wood, Thyme, and Clary sage) with organic carrier oils (Almond Oil, Avocado Oil, Cocoa Butter, Coconut Oil, Grape-seed Oil, Jojoba oil, Olive oil and Shea Butter). In addition, I used Vegetable Glycerin and Aloe Vera gel for moisturizers and Dr Bronners\u2019 unscented soap to create my own shampoo solutions.&nbsp; These products worked wonders on my hair and skin, along with cutting down my wash routine drastically.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I can now go swimming, do water aerobics and hard cardio in the gym wihtout worrying about products dripping from my hair. Also, whenever my hair bonnet would come off at night I rest assured that the products in my hair are also good for my face too. HOLLA!!&nbsp; (Vegetable Glycerin is pretty sweet). It took several months of trial and error, but I am now able to confidently write and say that my hair has flourished under these products, and I myself have become healthier for it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/highres_434919189.jpeg","photo_id":434919189,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/600_434919189.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/thumb_434919189.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13285151,"name":"Nadine"},"members":425,"name":"Kinky, Curly, Coiled, Natural Hair Meetup","id":18476380,"state":"NY","urlname":"naturallynatural","category":{"name":"fashion\/beauty","id":8,"shortname":"fashion-beauty"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"naturally natural"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425471409000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"cocktails","name":"Cocktails","id":10475},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"singles-30s-50s","name":"Singles 30's-50's","id":16660},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"dating-over-35","name":"Dating over 35","id":20662},{"urlkey":"new-york-city-events","name":"New York City Events","id":26546},{"urlkey":"singles-events","name":"Singles events","id":29852},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"singles-40s-50s","name":"Singles 40's - 50's","id":61916}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Single-And-Ready-To-Mingle-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Calling all singles!!!

They have been used throughout history in many cultures for their medicinal and therapeutic benefits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Dr. David Stewart, Ph.D., D.N.M. Integrated Aromatic Science Practitioner, describes the function of these fragrant essential oils in his book, The Chemistry of Essential Oils Made Simple: God\u2019s Love Manifest in Molecules.<\/p>\n<p>Essential oils have been called \u201cthe life blood of a plant.\u201d They circulate through plant tissues and pass through cell walls, carrying nutrition into cells and carrying waste products out. [Page 59]<\/p>\n<p>When essential oils are applied to people, they do the same thing, carrying oxygen into cells and carrying waste products out. In fact, essential oils are one of nature\u2019s best body cleansers. They can cleanse our cellular receptor sites of pharmaceutical drugs, petrochemicals, and other disruptors of intercellular communication. They can also chelate heavy metals and other toxins, helping to remove and flush them through the liver, colon, sweat, lungs, and kidneys. They can also increase our ability to absorb vitamins and other nutrients. [Page 59]<\/p>\n<p><b>Why I use Essential Oils<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Essential oils have also been used for thousands of years for cosmetic purposes, as well as for their spiritually and emotionally uplifting properties. Young Living has always been at the forefront of bringing this ancient tradition to modern users, introducing millions to a total mind body wellness they may never have dreamed possible. Primarily extracted through careful steam distillation but also through cold pressing, the purest essential oils are far more powerful than the botanicals from which they were extracted. Any time you hold a bottle of our powerful essential oils, you are holding nature's pure essence. Any time you hold a bottle of our powerful essential oils, you are holding the pure essence of health-promoting botanicals that can be diffused, inhaled, applied topically, incorporated into massage, or taken internally to:<\/p>\n<p><b>&nbsp;Inspire a positive emotional state:<\/b> Each essential oil\u2019s complex, pleasant, and unique scent activates the limbic system\u2014the brain\u2019s center of emotion and memory\u2014differently. Essential oils can be your key to a more fulfilling and balanced emotional life.<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils are convenient<\/b>, quick and easy to use.You can wear them during the day, diffuse them in your home or work place, or simply keep them in your pocket. Essential oils can be used in massage, and to enhance meditation and concentration.<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils&nbsp; penetrate the skin and cell membranes<\/b>.They can actually diffuse throughout the blood and tissues instantly in a matter of seconds! Oils cross the brain-blood barrier and reach the amygdala and other limbic parts of the brain that control our mood, emotions and beliefs. So they can help us with our ability to handle stress, anger or any other emotion we are dealing with!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Enhance your physical wellness :<\/b>Modern lifestyles don\u2019t always create optimal conditions for physical wellness. Poor diet, lack of exercise, and an overabundance of environmental toxins can leave the body unbalanced and diminish energy levels. From cleansing and weight management to supporting every system of the body, essential oils and essential oil-infused supplements can provide the targeted solutions you need to restore balance and feel your best.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil benefits include oxygenating properties<\/b>.Because they contain oxygen molecules they can transport nutrients to cells that are nutrient and\/or oxygen deprived. Healthy cells need oxygen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil benefits include that they are high in antioxidants.<\/b> We know that antioxidants strengthen the body\u2019s systems to prevent the damaging effects of aging, diet, and the environment; and eliminate free radicals. The Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) which tells you the antioxidant capacity of a food item is documented for many essential oils. Clove essential oil has an ORAC value of 1,078,700 \u00b5TE\/100g; this is a million more than the value for carrots which is 210 \u00b5TE\/100g!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Purify your home<\/b>: Harsh chemical formulas aren\u2019t your only home cleansing option. Enjoy peace of mind without compromise when you polish countertops, clean sticky messes, and cleanse dirty surfaces with the gentle but effective power of essential oils,<\/p>\n<p><b>Refine your skin:<\/b> Purge chemicals from your beauty routine and rediscover your natural glow. An ancient skin care secret, essential oils can help promote a clear-looking complexion, soften the appearance of signs of aging, and nurture healthy-looking hair.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils soothe muscles and joints.<\/b> They also can assist with minor aches and pains related to everyday activities especially in combination with massage. Yeah! &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil soothe digestion.<\/b> Peppermint (Mentha piperita)is one of the oldest and most highly regarded herbs for soothing digestion, it may also restore digestive efficiency. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Essential oil benefits include d-limonene a powerful antioxidant Lemon consists of 68 percent dlimonene.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Create deep spiritual awareness:<\/b> Incense and essential oils from plants have always played an important part in religious and spiritual ceremonies, helping participants to transcend the trivial and connect with something larger than themselves. Research shows that the pure constituents in these oils stimulate olfactory receptors and activate regions in the brain\u2019s limbic system associated with memory, emotion, and state of mind. To enhance your spiritual practice, dilute and apply meditative, empowering essential oils directly to wrists, feet, and behind the ears, or diffuse in a quiet space.<\/p>\n<p><b>Why I chose Young Living Essential Oils<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Young Living is proud to set the standard for essential oil purity and authenticity by carefully monitoring the production of our oils through our unique Seed to Seal\u00ae process.

Here is what sets this group apart: <br><\/p>\n<p>1). We will typically have 1-3 meals per week. Some weeks will have more and some will have less. So far we have averaged around 2 per week.<br><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;2). I am aiming to organize smaller dinners so everyone can get to know each other and we avoid being a large and awkward group. Dinners will almost always be around 4-5 people. This makes it very important that you show up if you RSVP. So far I have been asking new members for a written confirmation of attendance and we have had 100% attendance. I hope this will continue.<br><\/p>\n<p>3). Fees: I hate it when meetups charge a few dollars from each member. It makes me feel like the organizer is making money instead of bringing people together to enjoy an activity. I will cover all the meetup fees for now. If anyone wants to contribute feel free to but for now I am not going to ask.<\/p>\n<p> 4). A lot of groups seem to do the same activities or go to the same places over and over again. I will find new and exciting places to try that have good write ups and reviews. That being said, I am always open to member suggestions, so please send me suggestions of places you want to go. <br><\/p>\n<p>Thanks and I hope you join the group and we can have a lot of fun exploring the amazing NYC food scene.

The current power structure will have you believe that all that exists is the physical world before your eyes. Yet, they use spiritual and other supernatural means to control and dominate the planet all the while conspiring to limit your potential as a divine being. They have subversively replaced our moral values given to us by our ancient ancestors with the worship of satanism, sex, money, materialism, militarism, power, racism, and sexism. They have further replaced true spiritualism with religious dogma and the belief in the five senses (physical existence) only. In fact, they are the chief architects of many of the planets conflicts.<\/p>\n<p>Project Illuminated is a global effort to reveal the truth of our existence and show you how to create a new reality. One where you don't need to protest, amass a military like arsenal of weapons or get into wars to change the direction of the world. The powerful and free information as presented through this group will reveal the secrets of the universe that will help revolutionize our current thought process.

To find your dance is to find yourself at your most fluid and creative level. While the practice itself is the essence of simplicity, it has the power to catalyze deep healing and creative expression. The primary teaching of this work is: If you put the psyche in motion, it will heal itself. The five rhythms are: Flowing, Staccato, Chaos, Lyrical, and Stillness. They come together to create the Wave, a movement meditation practice. Rather than having steps to follow, each rhythm is a different energy field in which you find you own expression and choreography, thereby stretching your imagination as well as your body. Each rhythm is a teacher and you can expect to meet different and sometimes unknown aspects of yourself as your dance unfolds and your practice of the rhythms deepens over time. What to expect \/ what happens in class? In every class or workshop, there is always a wide range of experience in the 5Rhythms work, from first-timers to certified Wave addicts. In any given class, the teacher will be following the energy of the room. So, while the essential map is one of five rhythms, the teacher might take the class through the entire Wave or focus on just one rhythm or one facet of the rhythm. The rhythms themselves are gateways to literally thousands of different movement landscapes. Like the body, they are alive and designed to catalyze the dancer\u2019s movement expression in the moment. You are different every time you walk into the room; so is the group and so is your teacher. Therefore, each class holds completely unique possibilities. Class is located at the beautiful studios of Hamilton Health and Fitness (HHF), at 161 Erie Street (by Hamilton Park). HHF is a unique fitness center, offering integrated services for the body, mind and soul. Class cost: No charge for full members or HHF $20 for non-members $15 for non-member students and seniors","lon":-74.0500030518,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":24485922,"name":"Jilsarah"},"members":21,"name":"Release: A 5Rhythms\u00ae Event in Jersey City","id":18489513,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Release-A-5Rhythms-Event-in-Jersey-City","category":{"name":"dancing","id":5,"shortname":"dancing"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Valhalla","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425941365000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"workingmoms","name":"Working Moms","id":10555},{"urlkey":"moms-supporting-moms","name":"Moms Support","id":17140},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147},{"urlkey":"mommy-me","name":"Mommy and Me","id":18014}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westchester-Weekend-Mommy-Me-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This is a meetup group for toddlers and their mommies!

How many of our needs and wants can we fill by connecting with members of our community, or people they know? What happens when we fill each other's needs and wants without expecting anything in return? Rather than arrange exchanges, we give our goods and services freely. Gratitude takes the place of money. You feel gratitude when you receive a gift; you express your gratitude by paying it forward. Through this beautiful experiment, we seek to test the hypothesis that we can establish richer relationships, and live richer lives, right here in New York City - if we risk leaning on each other a bit more, and thereby realizing our collective wealth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>In our first year or so of meetings (called Gift Circles), we saw exchanges ranging from the small and concrete to the huge and amazing.

You might ask for cooking lessons,&nbsp;a book, a dog sitter for the weekend, help cleaning your apartment, writing help, shoes, a foot massage, tools, a shoulder to cry on,&nbsp;a lamp, tools, an apartment, or anything at all! Whether your requests are granted will depend on who's in the Circle and what resources they can call on. <br><\/p>\n<p>- <b>Offering gifts<\/b> - What do you want to give to the community as a whole, or to one or more people within the community? You might offer a jar of pickles, a hug, a bike, friendship, a couch to crash on, a ride to the airport, guitar lessons, sewing help, a job, a home-cooked meal, an E-reader, or (again) anything at all! <br><\/p>\n<p>- <b>Expressing gratitude<\/b> - What do you feel grateful for?

It\u2019s about connecting to life in its purest form \u2014 breath. It\u2019s about the union of your mind, body, and spirit. My amazing teacher calls laughter yoga, \"THE HAPPINESS WORKOUT\" and says that it is a form of \u201cedu-tainment\u201d designed to relieve stress and cultivate joy through a fun mix of mind-body exercises. All it takes is an open mind and a willingness to let go. Your body doesn\u2019t know the difference between spontaneous and induced laughter. So, even forced laughter produces endorphins and decreases cortisol\u2014instant benefits for your mood and stress levels. Before you know it, fake laughter turns into real guttural belly laughs. That\u2019s when the really good stuff gets released! Doing that on a regular basis actually re-wires your brain toward positivity. Benefits of Laughter Yoga Good Mood and More Laughter: Laughter Yoga helps to change your mood within minutes by releasing certain chemicals from your brain cells called endorphins. You will remain cheerful and in a good mood throughout the day and will laugh more than you normally do. Healthy Exercise to Beat Stress: Laughter Yoga is like an aerobic exercise (cardio workout) which brings more oxygen to the body and brain thereby making one feel more energetic and relaxed. Health Benefits: Laughter Yoga reduces the stress and strengthens the immune system.You will not fall sick easily and if you have some chronic health conditions, you will heal faster. Quality of Life: Laughter is a positive energy which helps people to connect with other people quickly and improves relationships. If you laugh more, you will attract many friends. Positive Attitude in Challenging Times : Everyone can laugh when life is good, but how does one laugh when faced with challenges? Laughter helps to create a positive mental state to deal with negative situations and negative people. It gives hope and optimism to cope with difficult times. How does Laughter Yoga work? Most of the Laughter in a Laughter Yoga session is initiated in the group with full body laughter exercises, clapping, eye contact and youthful playfulness. The \"simulated\" laughter soon turns into real, spontaneous and contagious laughter that brings much more oxygen to our body and brain, lifting our spirits and carrying over into our work, school and social lives. We will also end with a chocolate yum meditation. Dr Kataria who is the brain child behind laughter yoga says the 5 benefits of laughter yoga are : 1. Good Mood and more laughter 2. Healthy Exercise to beat stress ( and who couldnt use a little less stress in their life) 3. Health benefits ; lower your blood pressure and cholesterol. Help beat depression, chronic pain issues ...the possibilities are endless 4. Quality of life improves, you are able to connect with people more and on a more true and intimate level 5. Positive in Challenging times **All this just from laughing!** Come once or come every week for this amazing experience.

You are the author of your life. Art completes you and that completion will allow you to create either the life you want or paint from your authentic self. You will have the inspiration and energy after our meet ups. Your constant Self doubt made you forget that you are a possibility. You will learn the practices that you can do on your own so you can continue your own expansion. Materials you might need: 1. If you already know that you will continue your practice please invest into a new and awesome multi media sketch book. We will turn it into your own text book and a book of personal inspiration and guidance. If not, loose paper is good too. 2. Colors that you choose matter. If you can afford good quality colors that have a better pigment please get them. Focus only on the colors that attract you if you are buying them separately. 3. Avoid oils an acrylic for this introductory workshop for easy clean up. 4. My suggestion would be to include markers and pencils and watercolors and tempera or quashes. Tempera and quashes will allow more vibrancy in your work. Watercolors is a great idea if you like soft and tender art, 8. Brushes of different sizes would be good. I would not suggest spending a lot of money on the expensive brushes yet. I will talk about other courses I teach or promote like Modern Breakthrough for women, Vedic Art, Paint Your Private Sessions, Meditation Meetups and Science of Completion workshops. I noticed that these session facilitate the artistic progress and I find them very relevant to your artistic growth.

Nowrouz: the first day of Spring and the New Year holiday in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Iran, Pakistan, parts of Russia and India and among the Kurds; comes at the vernal equinox.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":107352602,"name":"aresh"},"members":23,"name":"New York's Chaharshanbeh Soori (Fire Festival) Advocates","id":18507362,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-Yorks-Chaharshanbeh-Soori-Fire-Festival-Advocates","category":{"name":"language\/ethnic identity","id":16,"shortname":"language"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Charshanbeh Soori Advocates"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1426607771000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"ebizowners","name":"E-Business Owners","id":1330},{"urlkey":"freelance","name":"Freelance","id":9876},{"urlkey":"coworking","name":"Coworking","id":14990},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"small-business-owners","name":"Small Business Owners","id":20743},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"creative-freelancers","name":"Creative Freelancers","id":25505},{"urlkey":"freelancers-in-new-york-city","name":"Freelancers in New York City","id":82583},{"urlkey":"freelancer-networking","name":"Freelancer Networking","id":496242}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Freelancers\/","rating":0,"description":"This is a group for anyone interested in networking and building professional relationships with the growing freelancer community in Brooklyn.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":128112762,"name":"Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce"},"members":183,"name":"Brooklyn Freelancers","id":18508223,"state":"NY","urlname":"Brooklyn-Freelancers","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Freelancers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1426608148000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"machine-learning","name":"Machine Learning","id":29971},{"urlkey":"data-analytics","name":"Data Analytics","id":30928},{"urlkey":"data-visualization","name":"Data Visualization","id":37381},{"urlkey":"predictive-analytics","name":"Predictive Analytics","id":38458},{"urlkey":"data-mining","name":"Data Mining","id":55324},{"urlkey":"data-science","name":"Data Science","id":102811},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"big-data-analytics","name":"Big Data Analytics","id":383411}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Columbia-Data-Science-Institute\/","rating":4.5,"description":"The Data Science Institute at Columbia University is a world-leading institution in both research and education in the theory and practice of data science.

After my own almost 3 year infertility struggle, I've found it hard to connect with other women like myself and hope to find some compassionate and supportive women who want to get together to talk and listen and discover new friendships over drinks, coffee, brunch, dinner or other social activities. I am not a therapist and this group isn't meant to replace therapy, its intended more as a social outlet to connect with others who have had the unfortunate experience of dealing with infertility, and can relate to one another. If you are interested in this group, then my heart goes out to you because I know the pain you've carried.

We encourage active participation.&nbsp; NYLXS Members are participants in all activities.<\/p>\n<p>From its foundation in late 2001, granted its 501.c status in 2007, its membership driven structure has driven the organization to try experimental, new organizational and educational concepts, much of which has been ground breaking and adopted by other organizations world wide.<\/p>\n<p>NYLXS was the first organization to offer cheap and free detailed classes on the use of free software, Linux and the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/GNU\">GNU<\/a> system for the general public. It has been on the cutting edge in framing Digital Rights issues with the founding of NY Fair Use, and later, the New York Association of Copyright Stake Holders. NYLXS also began a publicly available professional \"<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Inservice_Program\">Inservice Program<\/a>\" in which professionals and researchers in <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Free_Software\">Free Software<\/a> are given a platform to explain their latest technological research to other professionals, in a peer review process.<\/p>\n<p>NYLXS also created the <i>Free Software Chamber of Commerce<\/i>, which aligns <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Information_Technology\">IT<\/a> consultants into a joint support group for improved customer services and legal services for individual IT consultants in the New York City area.<\/p>\n<p>We have established a weekly radio show every weekend which is broadcast over the Internet only, as well as a quarterly scholarly journal, and a variety of mailing lists. They've worked with the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_Department_of_Education\">Department of Education<\/a> in bringing free software to schools. They have supported education nationally, internationally, and in local government about the availability and advantages of free software, as well advice on public policy which will encourage, and promote free software. They have also focused on education of the public's broad interest in survival of free software.<\/p>\n<p>We meet in <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Brooklyn\">Brooklyn<\/a> and Manhattan, but have reached people all accross the world from Europe to California.&nbsp; We meet most frequently in <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Brooklyn\">Brooklyn<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lower_Manhattan\">Lower Manhattan<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>NYLXS as a non-profit sells no services, and only provides public service.<\/p>\n<p>People come to the Free Software movement for a variety of reasons. Except for the most politically active members among us, the main reason is an attraction to the soundness of the technology and the freedom to access the computer systems we use. Another compelling reason is the economic incentives it can provide disenfranchised individuals as well as large businesses. It's a testimony to our current freedoms that we come to free software without a second thought to the underlining principles that allow for the existence of such systems. In our work promoting free software, we've been surprised how often, even in our own circles, there exists huge resistance to anything political or the least bit distasteful. As a population, we have learned to be skeptical of politicians and stubbornly apolitical.&nbsp; We loudly promote Free Software by having members participate in teaching, writing, learning, and marketing Freee Software. <br><\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/6\/e\/highres_435438286.jpeg","photo_id":435438286,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/6\/e\/600_435438286.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/6\/e\/thumb_435438286.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":185403393,"name":"nylxs"},"members":17,"name":"NYLXS - We are Doers","id":18512482,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYLXS-We-are-Doers","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Do'ers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Rahway","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1426865102000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"photo","name":"Photography","id":223},{"urlkey":"group-photo-shoots","name":"Group Photo Shoots","id":15731},{"urlkey":"model-photography","name":"Model Photography","id":16615},{"urlkey":"studio-photography","name":"Studio Photography","id":19646},{"urlkey":"nude-photo-shoots","name":"Nude Photo Shoots","id":34214},{"urlkey":"nude-photography","name":"Nude Photography","id":40287},{"urlkey":"glamour-photography","name":"Glamour Photography","id":48375},{"urlkey":"nude-photography-workshops","name":"Nude Photography Workshops","id":80333}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Speakeasy-Glamour-Photography\/","rating":4.98,"description":"<p>This is an exclusive network of artist photographers and models set out to great art.

As domains like medicine, technology, and marketing face dramatic cultural changes, these counter-corporate points-of-view are coming into the fore in ways that are more influential than ever. HIPS explores the current and future applications of the behavioral and social sciences to solve real-world problems through monthly meetups and online publications.
