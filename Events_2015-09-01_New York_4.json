It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts.

Much higher level of meditation in group than I can achieve doing my own practice. I was very happy to find a meditation group that was focused on bringing together community members to practice meditation. Bodhi meditation is unique because they offer free sessions to the community. Nan is a wonderful teacher, and very compassionate person. You can sense that she has extensive experience in oriental medicine including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and energy healing,. Thank you Nan. \u201d Joe, Bodhi Meditation class Wednesday October 29, 2014\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"It's like looking into the eyes of Pure Love. I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for. Thank you, Lynn\" Bodhi Meditation Class Saturday March 14, 2014\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201c Very strong healing energy tonight. I got there feeling very tired. I had stomach pain all day, and during the first meditation of the evening it got a lot better. By the end I wasn't thinking about it at all. I left full of energy. \u201d Pam, Bodhi Meditation class November 22, 2013<\/p> <p>\u201c I didn't realize I would be reaping the benefits of Bodhi Med so quickly after attending only two classes. After my second class I felt even more relaxed. I have insomnia, but after the second session I fell asleep faster and deeper which has not happened for a long time. \u201d Dee, Bodhi Meditation class September 18, 2013<\/p> <p>It was enlightening!!! Every time I practice Bodhi meditation, it feels like my Chi increases more and more!

After high school, he moved to Los Angeles in 1984, playing with Dick Berk, Dave Pike, Pete Christlieb, and Jack Sheldon and recording a quartet date for the R.A. Records label in 1987. Two years later, he moved to New York and has since worked mostly as a leader. Affif, an excellent bop-based guitarist whose style was influenced a bit by Joe Pass and George Benson (both of whom in turn enjoyed his playing), has recorded several impressive albums for Pablo. ~ Scott Yanow, All Music Guide<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/500658280100745\/500658286767411\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/500658280100745\/500658286767411\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/500658280100745\/500658286767411\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Juke-Joint-Music-Social-Club-Meetup\/events\/223988108\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Ron Affif Live @ The Zinc Bar","id":"223988108","time":1439258400000,"updated":1439271161000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1435324391000,"name":"NYC Jazz and Blues Music & Social Club Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18700409,"urlname":"NYC-Juke-Joint-Music-Social-Club-Meetup","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Juke Joint Jazzers!"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"71 W 35th St","name":"Monarch","lon":-73.98632,"id":23773499,"lat":40.750034,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.193105742335,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1434591324000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello Friends,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Join us Friday's at Monarch Rooftop for our first social Fridays this season.

However, they are prone to estimation error due to outliers and poor estimates may have significant impact on subsequent model results. We examine one technique for reducing this error as well as a method for extracting structure from the correlation matrix by use of a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Specifically, we first specify, download, and wrangle, end of day price time series for the majority of exchange traded US equity securities from Yahoo! Finance. Next, we review a result in random matrix theory of Marcenko and Pastur about the distribution of eigenvalues of correlation matrices constructed from random time series as well as financial applications of their result by Bouchaud and Potters. These ideas are then applied to filtering a correlation matrix constructed from the end of day stock prices. Next, we use an hierarchical clustering algorithm on the filtered correlation matrix in to order its columns and extract sector information of the stocks\u2019 time series using only their price data. We finally comment on a few interesting facts that we find as a result. \u00a0<i>Stephen Taylor enjoys using Python for applied data analysis and statistics projects. He holds a B.S. in Applied Mathematics, an M.S. in Mathematics, an M.S. in Physics, and a Ph.D. in quantitative finance from SUNY Stony Brook and\u00a0the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management. He has served as an industry student project advisor for the University of Chicago and NYU Quantitative Finance programs. He also has worked as a\u00a0Quantitative Researcher at Bloomberg, was on the research staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory,\u00a0was a fixed income strategist at Morgan Stanley, and worked in the quantitative research\u00a0group at Hutchin Hill Capital.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Jason Grout, <i>SageMathCloud - Mathematical computing in the cloud.<\/i><\/b>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sagemath.org\/\">Sage (sagemath.org)<\/a> is a comprehensive open-source mathematical software distribution based on Python. \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.sagemath.com\/\">SageMathCloud (cloud.sagemath.com)<\/a> is an <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sagemathinc\/smc\">open-source<\/a> web platform for using the Sage mathematical software. \u00a0It provides, among other things, full collaborative editing in the Sage notebook, the IPython notebook, an online TeX editor, and a Unix shell, as well as frequent snapshots of data, public sharing of projects, and a course management system for educators using the platform in the classroom. \u00a0We will discuss both Sage and the SageMathCloud platform. <i>\u00a0Jason Grout is a professional software developer at Bloomberg. \u00a0He develops systems using Python and web technologies for interactive scientific computing and data exploration. \u00a0He has contributed extensively to the SageMath and IPython\/Jupyter open-source projects, and is a member of the IPython steering council. \u00a0He earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Brigham Young University and formerly was an assistant professor of mathematics at Drake University, where he used technology extensively in teaching.<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Spencer Lyon, <i>QuantEcon: economics meets open source.<\/i><\/b> \u00a0In this talk we will explore <a href=\"http:\/\/quant-econ.net\/\">QuantEcon<\/a>\u00a0(<a href=\"http:\/\/quant-econ.net\">quant-econ.net<\/a>), a collaborative effort to bring open source teaching materials and tools to economics.

Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside as a backup.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

There are &lt;a&gt;multiple games&lt;\/a&gt; going on at once, so getting involved in a game is &lt;a&gt;easy&lt;\/a&gt;.<\/p> <p><br\/>For those of you unfamiliar with the term, a Table Top RPG (Role &lt;a&gt;Playing&lt;\/a&gt; Game) is a type of game where the players create characters based on the \u00a0story\/system available and one person acts as a storyteller. Everyone interacts and works together to &lt;a&gt;create a story&lt;\/a&gt; and have a few laughs as well.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>New Rules for Signing Up:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>How to &lt;a&gt;sign up&lt;\/a&gt;: There will be at leas two &lt;a&gt;games running&lt;\/a&gt; each week.\u00a0 You will be able to see who is running, what games are being &lt;a&gt;played&lt;\/a&gt;, and who is &lt;a&gt;playing&lt;\/a&gt; below. There will be a total of six spots &lt;a&gt;open&lt;\/a&gt; in each game, so if a game has filled up you will not be able to join that game.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>When you &lt;a&gt;sign up&lt;\/a&gt;, leave a comment stating which game you would like to participate in and your name will be added to the roster. If you would like to leave a game or switch over to another game in &lt;a&gt;progress&lt;\/a&gt;, simply speak to Justin or Cat. They will let you know if there is &lt;a&gt;open&lt;\/a&gt; space to do so.<\/p> <p><br\/>If it is your first time &lt;a&gt;attending&lt;\/a&gt; a game, we have pre-made characters for you to &lt;a&gt;select&lt;\/a&gt; from. Beginning on your third RPG event, you may choose to make an original character for whatever game you're currently participating in.<\/p> <p><br\/>Can I run my own game?: If you would like to run your own game, please contact Justin or Cat to reserve a slot.<\/p> <p><br\/>Need Dice?: Please bring yours if you have some if you need extra I will provide some.<\/p> <p><b>Cat, Steve and Myself will be available to run.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYSciFi-Fantasy\/events\/220778198\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"NY SciFi & Fantasy Tabletop Role Playing and Game Night","id":"dtzrrcytlbpb","time":1439331300000,"updated":1439344836000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1210270716000,"name":"NY SciFi & Fantasy","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":1141101,"urlname":"NYSciFi-Fantasy","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"SciFi & Fantasy Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Carle Place","address_1":"165 Old Country Rd","name":"Panera Bread","lon":-73.615768,"id":20013132,"lat":40.743511,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":19.6344127655,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432726213000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We are planning to sit, chat and have fun while improving our American Sign Language skills. \u00a0We are at a great location right off of the Meadowbrook Parkway at Panera Bread. \u00a0So if you are coming from work, you can grab a bite to eat and relax too!

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't open our door from 6:30 - 7 pm while meditation is in progress. Kindly refrain from ringing our buzzer during this time.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/223814443\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjytlbpb","time":1439332200000,"updated":1439345324000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"131 Greenpoint Ave","name":"The Bounty","lon":-73.954811,"id":23509312,"state":"NY","lat":40.730385,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":18,"headcount":0,"distance":2.29170894623,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438108642000,"fee":{"amount":65,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price (inc. tax\/tip)","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":4,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello Oyster Lovers,<\/p> <p>We're in the height of summer and there's no better time to set sail with <a href=\"http:\/\/thebountybrooklyn.com\/\">The Bounty<\/a> on a boysterous journey!

But before they became the corporate machine that they are sometimes referred to as today, they earned this title by wowing audiences worldwide with some of the most electrifying performances in the history of rock-n-roll. Beginning with the recording of the classic album \u2018Beggar\u2019s Banquet\u2019 in the late 60\u2019s, the Rolling Stones would enter into what is widely considered to be their most creative period that would continue right up through the release of the album \u2018Exile On Main St.\u2019 You will be amazed at the way The Glimmer Twins are able to recreate the look and feel of The Rolling Stones during this period and beyond. The Rolling Stones single handedly changed the way rock concerts were presented to large audiences when they kicked off their \u201969 U.S. Tour which is thoroughly documented in the movie \u2018Gimme Shelter\u2019. By combining the raw energy of the band with the more sophisticated amplification systems for the times, The Stones were able to connect with their mass audiences in sold-out arenas on a whole new level. The Glimmer Twins will give you a close-up view and feeling of what it was like to be in the audience at one of these historical performances. By 1972 their live performances were creating such frenzy, that many venues needed to utilize a lottery system in order to fairly distribute tickets because of the overwhelming demand. In subsequent years, the audiences kept increasing in size to the point where The Stones were selling out stadiums across the world. Everyone wanted to experience the sensation of seeing The Rolling Stones perform. What makes The Glimmer Twins such a special attraction is their ability to capture the raw energy of the most electrifying performances throughout The Rolling Stones career, and present it in such a way that audiences are able to experience the same sensation of what it was like to be at a Stones concert in their heyday. Because of the uncanny resemblances to Mick Jagger &amp; Keith Richards in their prime coupled with the special attention given to the minutest details both musically and visually, The Glimmer Twins deliver a Classic Rolling Stones Experience to their audience.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Look for orange cowgirl hat, bring bug spray,  a lawn chair.

I will also present the motivations behind developing Clasp, which is to develop software that will enable the design of sophisticated molecular devices that mimic and rival the proteins that are the machines that build the natural world.<\/p> <p>A goal of Clasp is to become a performant Common Lisp that can use C++ libraries and interoperate with LLVM-based tools and languages. The first sophisticated C++ library with which Clasp interoperates is the Clang C\/C++ compiler front end. Using the Clang library, Common Lisp programs can be written that parse and carry out static analysis and automatic refactoring of C\/C++ code. This facility is used to automatically analyze the Clasp C++ source code and construct an interface to the Memory Pool System compacting garbage collector.<\/p> <p>The primary purpose of Clasp is to act as a performant language for scientific computing that will be used to design sophisticated new molecular devices, catalysts and therapeutic molecules based on our \"Molecular Lego\" technology. Clasp is a general programming language that will support many other applications. About the Speaker: Christian Schafmeister visited Google\u2019s Cambridge, MA office to deliver the talk \"Clasp: Common Lisp using LLVM and C++ for Molecular Metaprogramming\u201d.<\/p> <p><b>Bio<\/b><\/p> <p>Christian is Associate Professor of Chemistry at Temple University. Research projects within his group will use the tools of synthetic chemistry, molecular biology, and X-ray crystallography to develop a universal molecular scaffold that would allow the systematic design, construction, and investigation of macromolecules that display chemical functionality in three-dimensional space. A scaffold like this will allow the design and synthesis of new catalysts, molecular sensors, and ultimately molecular machines. His group will use synthetic chemistry to synthesize molecular building blocks that they will couple to each other through pairs of bonds to construct rigid macromolecules with diverse and programmable shapes. His group has developed computer software that allows the computer-aided design of these molecules to carry out specific functions.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LispNYC\/events\/218893039\/","yes_rsvp_count":61,"name":"Christian Schafmeister on CLASP","id":"dzfpqytlbpb","time":1439334000000,"updated":1439356008000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1291904633000,"name":"LispNYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1748515,"urlname":"LispNYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Lispnycs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10022","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"Lexington Avenue and East 53rd Street","name":"THE ATRIUM @ Citigroup Center","lon":-73.971005,"id":3337342,"state":"NY","lat":40.758376,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":0,"distance":1.15262103081,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1393992688000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will be near the piano, come look for us.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>Let's tame some idioms and some accents !!<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>This week we're continuing with a combined session: about half our time taming idioms as usual, and the second half working on accent reduction and pronunciation.<\/p> <p>All our native tongues introduce elements that we bring to learning English as a Second Language.

We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

Here's a blurb from Amazon:<\/p> <p>This Has Never Happened Before.<br\/>You're operating your business in a time when something is happening that is so momentous it has never happened before. Jim Blasingame identifies it as an epochal marketplace shift that's causing the 10,000-year-old Age of the Seller to be replaced by the Age of the Customer.<\/p> <p>Jim will reveal to you in plain language:<br\/>How the two Ages currently, but temporarily, exist in parallel universes, and how much time you have left to join the emerging universe.<\/p> <p>How relevance is replacing competitiveness as the coin of the realm, and what you have to do to make this switch to Age of the Customer thinking.<\/p> <p>How your future will increasingly be decided at the Moment of Relevance, and what you have to do to be the chosen one at that moment.<\/p> <p>The new influencers who co-own your brand message sometimes before you even know they exist and how you can get them to be your partner.<\/p> <p>Why you must become a storyteller.<\/p> <p>The good, bad, and ugly of social media.<\/p> <p>The killer app that wasn't any part of your past but will dominate your future.<\/p> <p>Jim will teach you how the Age of the Customer is impacting love, trust, emotions, niches, globalization, intellectual property, selling, branding, and even technology. Plus he will reveal what is not going to change.<\/p> <p>In the Foreword, Steve Forbes says Jim has both the foresight of a prophet and the courage of a heretic. This book is a visionary message delivered with tough love and, as Steve says, Jim is the best at this.<\/p> <p>You'll keep this book handy for continual reference, because you won't find the perspectives Jim Blasingame delivers here anywhere else in any one place. It's The Age of the Customer.

You can be fancy and call it being an \"<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@garyvee\/13-thoughts-on-being-an-entrepreneur-18f2157af78b\">entrepreneur<\/a>,\" but at the end of the day, I do business. While most eight year olds were learning how to properly squeeze a lemon, I was managing seven lemonade stands across my neighborhood in Edison, NJ. When I turned twelve, I set my sights on my local mall, where I became something of a legend selling baseball cards on weekends. In high school I joined the family business, a liquor store called Shoppers Discount Liquors that my dad started. It wasn\u2019t long before I became obsessed with collecting wine.<\/p> <p>My core thesis has always revolved around one question:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wDAJEjWjrCc\">Are you marketing like the year you actually live in?<\/a>\u00a0That\u2019s it. It\u2019s not about where things are going to be in 5 years, and it\u2019s definitely not about how we\u2019ve always done it. Do what works. Right now.<\/p> <p>In 1997 I was selling wine with an email list while most stores were still faxing their customers. Building on that, I quickly came to recognize the importance of e-commerce, and launched\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/winelibrary.com\/\">WineLibrary.com<\/a>, one of the very first wine sales sites. As soon as Google Adwords came out, I was the first (and for a long time the only) person to advertise against people searching for \u201cwine.\u201d All of this helped me to grow the store from a $3 million business to a $60 million business, and it was just the beginning.<\/p> <p>Within a year of YouTube popping up, I knew it would be an incredibly powerful platform. Armed with a Flipcam and a NY Jets bucket, I started\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/tv.winelibrary.com\/\">Wine Library TV\u00a0<\/a>in 2006 to share my knowledge and passion for wine with a community that desperately needed a fresh voice. It wasn\u2019t long before 100,000 people were watching my videos every day (shout-out to my Vayniacs \u2013 love you guys).<\/p> <p>In the spring of 2009, my brother AJ and I launched\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/adage.com\/article\/special-report-agency-alist-2014\/ad-age-s-2014-agency-a-list-10-shops-watch-2014\/291331\/\">VaynerMedia<\/a>, a strategic creative agency focusing on social and digital. VaynerMedia has helped Fortune 500 companies like\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/adage.com\/article\/cmo-strategy\/ge-makes-super-materials-relatable-moon-boot-makeover\/294130\/\">GE<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/adage.com\/article\/cmo-strategy\/aquafina-introduces-products-targeting-teens\/244473\/\">PepsiCo<\/a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/adage.com\/article\/cmo-strategy\/mtn-dew-makes-big-investment-taco-bell-exclusive\/293057\/\">Mt Dew<\/a>\u00a0execute against their\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Performance_indicator\">KPI\u2019s<\/a>, and build their digital brands through micro content and other storytelling techniques. The idea took hold, and what started as a 6-person project 5 years ago has swelled to a 400-strong team spread across the country.<\/p> <p>After years of angel investing in companies like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/angel.co\/gary\">Twitter<\/a>, Tumblr,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/gary-vaynerchuk\">Uber<\/a>\u00a0and BirchBox, I just\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2014\/02\/14\/heres-what-gary-vaynerchuck-is-really-up-to-with-that-new-25m-fund-exclusive\/\">launched VaynerRSE<\/a>, a $25 million seed fund that will help invest in and launch the next generation of world-changing technology companies.<\/p> <p>When I\u2019m not spending time with my family, who mean everything in the world to me, I\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLfA33-E9P7FCEF1izpctGGoak841XYzrJ\">speak<\/a>\u00a0and share my experiences in business with people around the world.

WordPress is great for managing content. When you combine them into a distributed architecture, you get a system that excels in both areas.<\/p> <p>Join Jeff Sternberg, VP Tech @Observer, as he walks through the technical architecture of the recently re-launched Commercial Observer, a leading source of news and information for commercial real estate professionals. The new site utilizes WordPress for editorial content and Django for the front end, loosely coupled together with the WordPress.com REST API.

In this biweekly series, we\u2019ll explore classic introductory Buddhist books. Although we have \u201creading assignments\u201d, the meetings focus more on basic Buddhist teachings rather than strict discussions of the books. Our meetings are casual and informal; all levels of interest and experience are welcome. When possible, we\u2019ll have copies of the current book available at no cost.<\/p> <p>*** Right Now We\u2019re Reading: \u201cThe Dhammapada\u201d translated by Gil Fronsdal***<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dhammapada\">The Dhammpada<\/a> (Teachings of the Dharma) is one of the most popular, widely read, and most accessible of all Buddhist texts. The clear and direct teachings on key topics like meditation, mindfulness, ethics, and compassion are especially well-suited for anyone exploring basic Buddhist teachings.<\/p> <p>While there are many translations of the Dhammapada, we\u2019ve chosen to read the version by Gil Fronsdal, frequently cited as the best English version to date. The book is readily available in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shambhala.com\/the-dhammapada-1.html\">bookstores <\/a>and libraries. Furthermore, there are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.insightmeditationcenter.org\/books-articles\/dhammapada\/\">audio versions of all chapters<\/a> freely available from the Insight Meditation Center.<\/p> <p><b>For the August 12th meeting, please read Chapters 19 through 21 (~11 pages). <\/b><\/p> <p>Discussion points include:<\/p> <p>-What does it mean to be a \"good person\"?<\/p> <p><br\/>-What is the Eightfold Path?<\/p> <p><br\/>-What happens when one really practices Buddhism?<\/p> <p><br\/>***<\/p> <p>Happy reading and we hope to see you soon!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Big-Lotus\/events\/224135221\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":5400000,"name":"Beginner Buddhist Book Circle","id":"sdkmglytlbqb","time":1439418600000,"updated":1439673406000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1413858178000,"name":"The Big Lotus","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":17759102,"urlname":"Big-Lotus","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Dharma Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10022","country":"us","city":"New York","phone":"212.891.6453","address_1":"6 EAST 57TH STREET","name":"NIKETOWN","lon":-73.973675,"id":904983,"state":"NY","lat":40.762849,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.23455440998,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1430599654000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Every Wednesday we meet at Niketown to Run 3,5 or 7 miles Please contact me specifically if your coming[masked]-5663.

You can set a variable in a Python cell and then read that variable in a subsequent R cell, and everything just works, magically.

Patricia Jordan, aka PJ, and Bob Pecoraro both traveled to this pristine region of Mexico last August.\u00a0 They will share their experiences with you through photographs and video.\u00a0 PJ will talk in depth about the American Crocodile and her experiences at Chinchorro, and Bob will share some of his video and discuss some of the other wildlife encounters he had in this region, from Whale Sharks in Cancun to Manatees in Xcalak.<\/p> <p>About the Speakers:<\/p> <p><b>Patricia Jordan<\/b> (also known as PJ) is a retired physical education teacher from New Jersey.\u00a0 PJ has been diving for over forty years, mostly in warm-water locations such as the Caribbean, Central and South America, the South Pacific, the Red Sea, and Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia.\u00a0 A free-lance photographer, she has captured images depicting the extraordinary beauty of our underwater world as well as the diverse cultural rites of indigenous populations worldwide which she presents at symposiums, educational institutes and universities, and dive seminars.\u00a0 Her images have appeared in publications such as Graphis, Islands, Ocean Realm, Alert Diver and Dive Training, and have garnered awards in international and national competitions --\u00a0 most recently as Dive Photo Guide\u2019s Photographer of the Week for June 12, 2014 and Beneath the Sea\u2019s 2015 Imaging Competition.\u00a0 PJ has worked as a research diver for the Pacific Whale Foundation in Maui, Hawaii, and is a Fellow Member of the Explorers Club. &lt;a&gt;www.pjdives.com.&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><b>Bob Pecoraro<\/b> became a PADI certified diver while serving in the U.S.\u00a0 Marine Corps in Hawaii in March 1987.\u00a0 By fall of 1988, Bob had become a PADI Instructor.\u00a0 He worked in the recreational diving industry in Hawaii for several years before moving back to New York City, where he became a police officer with the NYPD.\u00a0 Bob spent six years as a search and rescue diver for the NYPD before moving into the forensics field, where he is still currently employed.\u00a0 Bob is an avid dive traveler who has amassed over two thousand dives in some of the most remote parts of the world, including Antarctica and Madagascar.\u00a0 He has visited every continent in search of unusual and uncommon encounters, such as Sperm Whales in Dominica and Salmon Sharks in Alaska.\u00a0 Bob has been a member of the NYC Sea Gypsies since 2011.<\/p> <p>**** \u00a0Note:\u00a0 The official\u00a0 Club Annual\u00a0 Meeting\u00a0 as per our bylaws, where\u00a0 club\u00a0 where elections will take place,\u00a0 will be held in\u00a0 November\u00a0 *****<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"2nd floor","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/seagypsies\/events\/224300875\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"name":"August Meeting:   \u201cCrocodiles of Chinchorro Banks and More\u2026 \u201d","id":"nktpjlytlbqb","time":1439420400000,"updated":1439510588000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1212356639000,"name":"NYC Sea Gypsies - New York City's Dive Club","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1174634,"urlname":"seagypsies","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Scuba Divers or Sea Gypsies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"27 W 35th St","name":"Playwright Irish Pub","lon":-73.985191,"id":24004890,"lat":40.749805,"repinned":false},"headcount":37,"distance":0.252573847771,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438790262000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Do NOT rsvp for this event on this Meet Up<\/b> for your own privacy.\u00a0 Follow these simple directions.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.8minutedating.com\">www.8minutedating.com<\/a> is hosting 3 separate events at the playwright.\u00a0 Meet Up members are invited for $5 which is $35 off the public price. .<\/p> <p><br\/><b>If you or someone you know would like to participate please email [masked] for the discount code.<\/b><\/p> <p>Three separate Age group: 28-39, 39-49 &amp;

The report explores the implications and strategies for the City to adapt its physical and social infrastructure quickly and effectively to adapt to climate change.<\/p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, the NPCC\u2019s scientific input informed the City\u2019s 2013 report,\u00a0<i>A<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nyc.gov\/html\/sirr\/html\/report\/report.shtml\">\u00a0Stronger, More Resilient New York<\/a><\/i>. With this report NYC ORR established a long-range resiliency roadmap for the City. With its miles of shorelines and large low-lying areas, the City finds itself in an age of rapidly increasing climate risk \u2013 which makes the integration of climate science and policy vital for climate resilience, mitigation and adaptation .<\/p> <p>The event discussion will survey\u00a0the key findings from the NPCC report and how they are currently being integrated into the work of NYC ORR and addressed in policy agendas dealing with climate resiliency and public health.<\/p> <p>Dr. Radley Horton, one of the lead authors of the NPCC 2015 Report, will present a high-level overview of the report\u2019s key takeaways. In addition, Dana Kochnower of the Office of Recovery &amp; Resiliency will provide an update on the Stronger, More Resilient New York roadmap and discuss how the latest NPCC release is informing NYC ORR\u2019s strategy and priorities. A moderated discussion of New York City\u2019s vulnerabilities related to sea level rise and increased coastal storm activity with speakers and the audience will follow.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Click\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/be-exchange.org\/events\/125\">here<\/a>\u00a0for the main event page and to register<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>MODERATOR<br\/>Chris Garvin, Managing Partner,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.terrapinbrightgreen.com\/\">Terrapin Bright Green<\/a><\/p> <p>SPEAKERS<br\/>Dr. Radley Horton, Associate Research Scientist, Center for Climate Systems Research,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/ccsr.columbia.edu\/\">Columbia University<\/a><br\/>Dana Kochnower, Senior Policy Advisor,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nyc.gov\/html\/planyc\/html\/home\/home.shtml\">Mayor's Office of Recovery and Resiliency\u00a0<\/a><\/p> <p>SCHEDULE<br\/>8:30 Registration &amp; Coffee<br\/>9:00 Welcoming Remarks<br\/>9:05 Presentation by Dr. Radley Horton<br\/>9:35 Presentation by Dana Kochnower<br\/>10:05 Moderated Audience Discussion<br\/>10:30 Close\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Click\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/be-exchange.org\/events\/125\">here<\/a>\u00a0for the main event page and to register<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>ABOUT THE REPORT:<br\/><i><a href=\"http:\/\/be-exchange.org\/resources\/source\/56\">Building the Knowledge Base for Climate Resiliency<\/a><\/i>, published in February 2015 by the New York City Panel on Climate Change, reviews climate trends and future projections for the City of New York from 2013 to 2100.
