In his first term Mayor Maher founded Walden's Youth Employment Program, which has since employed over 60 youth between the ages of 14-18.<\/p> <p>As a standout athlete in high school, Brian was awarded a Division II Basketball scholarship to Post University in Waterbury, CT where he majored in Sociology. Maher later continued his studies at Brooklyn College where he developed and grew his passion for public service. As a political science major attending Brooklyn College, Maher interned for several nonprofit organizations and gained experience in grassroots outreach, fundraising and advocacy.\u00a0<br\/>In 2009 Maher returned home and answered his call to public service. Maher bested a two-term incumbent Mayor and a 14 year Trustee in a hotly contested three way Mayoral race. Maher ran for re-election in 2011 and 2013 unopposed. During his three terms as Mayor, Maher had a proven record of balanced growth, holding the line on taxes and developed and adopted a strong plan for economic development that both enhanced and protected Walden's infrastructure for the next 20 years.<\/p> <p>During his third term as Mayor Maher was hired by senior New York State Senator Bill Larkin. Maher started out as a constituent services aide and was recently promoted to communications director and official spokesman for Larkin who is now serving under the new Senate leadership as Deputy Majority Leader for House Operations.<\/p> <p>Maher's message stresses the importance of not just being a leader in government but also being a leader in his community. Since being elected Maher has:\u00a0<br\/>Founded \"Be the Movement, Inc.\" - A local nonprofit organization with a mission to provide opportunities for people to become more involved in community service.\u00a0<br\/>Co-Founded the \"Montgomery Youth Movement Council\" - Working with the Orange County Youth Bureau, this organization focuses on teens giving back to their community through intergenerational and educational workshops.\u00a0<br\/>Co-Founder\/Chairman, Hudson Valley Honor Flight - Honors WWII Veterans with an all expense paid flight to the WWII Memorial in Washington D.C.\u00a0<br\/>Chairman, Orange County Young Republicans Club\u00a0<br\/>Mid Hudson Regional Vice-Chair, NYSYR\u00a0<br\/>Board Member, Orange County Chamber of Commerce Young Professional Committee\u00a0<br\/>Maher spends any free time he has with his wife Becky and their 15 month old daughter Mia.<\/p> <p>Traditional Business Attire is REQUIRED.

A Contract with God has been called the first graphic novel, and its divergence from traditional comics themes and forms highlights Eisner's foresight and brilliance. Dealing with stories and memories from his childhood in a Bronx tenement, he explores the brutality, fragility, and tenderness possible among people living in close quarters close to the poverty line. The four stories here are tough but funny, deep but finely detailed, much like the traditional Jewish stories he drew upon to flavor his own work. Ending reflectively (and perhaps autobiographically), A Contract with God shows us a young man peering out into his city as he decides whether and how to face adulthood. You won't see that in the funny papers. --Rob Lightner\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"If it's nice out, we'll be outside.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Brooklyn-Comic-Book-Club\/events\/223273934\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"NBCBC #39 A Contract with God by Will Eisner","id":"223273934","time":1440113400000,"updated":1440125144000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1334339313000,"name":"North Brooklyn Comic Book Club","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":3663112,"urlname":"North-Brooklyn-Comic-Book-Club","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Comic Geeks"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":9,"headcount":0,"distance":5.09583377838,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":2,"created":1424365043000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Deadline for submission of stories to be critiqued is Friday of the week preceeding the Meetup.

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free.

I am so happy to share with you one of my new passions! THE FASCIANATION METHOD\u2122!! Within minutes of my first class I felt such a release in my body like I'd never felt before, even more than after a deep tissue massage or a day at the spa. If I carry a heavy bag on my shoulder I realize it causes headaches. Also I've been a dancer for much of my life and the unfortunate part is that it resulted in bunions! Randomly I feel shooting pains everywhere, beginning at my feet, then to my knees, hip, neck and head leading to headaches. Since I began using the fascianator to roll out my muscles, I feel open, more limber, and pain free. It's amazing!!!!<\/p> <p>Class Description: The Fascianation Method\u2122 is a self-myofascial release that involves using a fitness roller, the Fascianator\u2122, to assist in the release of #myofascial adhesions by rolling out the muscles to relax the fascia that surround them. This is done in a sequence beginning at the bottom of the foot and concluding at the back of neck. This causes a release of pressure on the nerves, arteries, veins and lymphatic vessels that cause pain, numbness, tingling, weakness and inflammation. Rolling out the muscles relax the fascia that surround them causing the release of pressure on the nerves, arteries, veins and lymphatic vessels that cause pain, numbness, tingling, weakness and inflammation. The Fascianator\u00ae myofascial release roller and Fascianation Method\u00ae are helping the masses terminate their chronic pain without invasive procedures and pharmacological agents. The Fascianator\u00ae and Fascianation Method\u00ae have been shown to terminate chronic pain and literally CHANGE lives! Giving people hope for their future while getting them off highly addictive pharmaceuticals! You owe it to yourself to live a life FREE from PAIN! Price: $20<\/p> <p>About Instructor Andriana:<br\/>During my stay in Hawaii I became certified in the FASCIANATION METHOD\u2122 by it\u2019s founder, Anthony Chrisco. It is a calling of mine to be knowledgeable in how to help myself and others live a healthy pain free lifestyle in order to improve the quality of the mind and body as a unit. I\u2019m so happy to have found the Fascianation Method. Everyday I learn something fascinating about Fascia and how activating this organ can have miraculous healing effects to overall health. I am officially the first instructor on the East Coast and at the time La Luz is the only studio to host this life changing class.<\/p> <p>WHAT IS FASCIA?<br\/>Fascia is the neurologically active tissue that envelops all of our tissues head to toe. Sometimes it is referred to as the \u2018plastic wrap\u2019 that keeps all our muscles and ligaments together. This connective tissue wraps and envelops our arteries, veins, muscles, nerves, organs, bones, tendons and ligaments and is the most neurologically active tissue in the body. It is the system that holds most of the water in our bodies.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/uzy8-wQzQMY\" class=\"embedded\">http:\/\/youtu.be\/uzy8-wQzQMY<\/a><\/p> <p>(READ MORE) When left untreated, it can exert tensile forces of up to 2,000 pounds per square inch on pain sensitive structures in the body and x-rays &amp; MRI's cannot see these areas of tension; referred to as myofascial adhesions. The Fascianation Method\u2122 involves using a fitness roller to assist in the release of these myofascial adhesions.<br\/>This pressure causes a decreased blood flow and decreased lymphatic drainage, which leads to increased inflammation and pain. Regular exercise and activity does help move the fascia, but rarely does it get at the source of the tension. And for those that cannot be physically active, myofascial release can help them decrease their pain and increase mobility so that they can begin being more active. GREAT VIDEO OF FASCIA EXPLAINED.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-uzQMn87Hg0\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-uzQMn87Hg0<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Despite the importance of this amazing tissue, fascia was not recognized as an organ system until 2012! And yet, this fascinating system has been known for thousands of years. In fact, the meridian lines (energy lines) in Traditional Chinese Medicine match up with key points of fascia! <a href=\"http:\/\/vibrantwellnessjournal.com\/2014\/02\/18\/myofascial-release-pain-management-self-healing\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/vibrantwellnessjournal.com\/2014\/02\/18\/myofascial-release-pain-management-self-healing\/<\/a><br\/>Here is a list of ailments that The Fascianation Method can help alleviate:<br\/>\u00b7 Plantar Fasciitis\/Heel Pain<br\/>\u00b7 Gout<br\/>\u00b7 Diabetic Foot<br\/>\u00b7 Shin Splints<br\/>\u00b7 Anterior Compartment Syndrome<br\/>\u00b7 Creaky Knees<br\/>\u00b7 I.T.

He is the developer of The Fascianator\u2122 Roller and the Fascianation Method\u2122, used to find and eliminate the stress in the body so it can heal itself. Anthony lectures and teaches both professionals in health and fitness and other allied health professions about the human body\u2019s fascial system, which was classified as an organ system just last year. His techniques of self-myofascial release has helped hundreds of people suffering from numerous chronic pain disorders. Anthony has over 18 years of study and experience in utilizing this method to help alleviate pain and issues through this process. In Anthony's Method he has mastered a way to alleviate stress and issues to your body so it can heal itself. He has a wealth of knowledge not only with this method of self treatment but with the body anatomy as a whole. Throughout the years Anthony researched myofascial release as a therapeutic modality and gathered clinical proof that led him to assert that self-myofascial release has therapeutic utility. Coincidentally, around that time, Eileen (Anthony\u2019s Wife and Co-Founder) was involved in a human tissue transplantation project which involved the study of fibroblasts, extracellular matrix (major component of fascia) and their role in affecting the immune system and injury repair. It became evident to Anthony and Eileen that caring for one's fascia most likely plays a role in not just fitness, but wellness. Anthony and Eileen are privileged to be Founding Members of the Fascia Research Society, in which they join academics, researchers, physicians, clinicians, movement therapists, physical therapists, massage therapists, chiropractors, and personal trainers to share interest and discussion about the human fascial system.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/La-Luz-Improv-Acting-Class\/events\/224599561\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"FASCIANATION METHOD (rolling out your muscles) Thurs 8pm","id":"dpkxglytlbbc","time":1440115200000,"updated":1440128532000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1362777630000,"name":"La Luz Bushwick BK- Acting-Improv-Dance-Yoga-Cooking Classes","group_lon":-73.9199981689,"id":7527282,"urlname":"La-Luz-Improv-Acting-Class","group_lat":40.7000007629,"who":"comedians, funny people, actors"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"99 Allen St","name":"Round K","lon":-73.99073,"id":23966716,"lat":40.718781,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":13,"headcount":0,"distance":2.16189002991,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":1,"created":1440018166000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Korean Dinner is for anyone who is interested in Korean food, culture and language.

Beginning in 1960, his pictures regularly appeared in every major national magazine, including the Saturday Evening Post, Look, LIFE, Newsweek, Time and, most often, Sports Illustrated.<\/p> <p>Leifer eventually became a staff photographer for Sports Illustrated before leaving in 1978 to become a staffer for Time magazine. In 1988 he was made a contributing photographer at LIFE magazine and spent the next two years dividing his time between Time and LIFE. When Leifer left Time Inc. in 1990, his photographs had appeared on over 200 Sports Illustrated, Time, and People covers\u2014at that point, the most ever published of one photographer\u2019s work in Time Inc. history. Neil Leifer is the 2006 recipient of the prestigious Lucie Award for Achievement in Sports Photography. In 2008 he was honored for his outstanding contribution to Time Inc. journalism with The Britton Hadden Lifetime Achievement Award.<\/p> <p>Leifer has published 16 books, 9 of which have been collections of his sports photographs. Sports, his 1978 Abrams book, is considered by many to be the quintessential sports photography book. His two most recent, Ballet in the Dirt and Guts and Glory\u2014both published by TASCHEN, showcase the very best of Leifer\u2019s professional baseball and football photographs. Leifer is currently working on his memoir \u201cRelentless\u201d which will be published in 2014.<\/p> <p>Leifer has traveled all over the world on sports assignments. He has photographed 16 Olympic Games (7 winter and 9 summer), 4 FIFA World Cups, 15 Kentucky Derbies, countless World Series games, the first 12 Super Bowls and every important heavyweight title fight since Ingemar Johansson beat Floyd Patterson in 1959. He has photographed his favorite subject, Muhammad Ali, on almost 60 different occasions\u2014covering his biggest fights and over 30 one-on-one studio sessions.<\/p> <p>While Neil Leifer is now a full-time filmmaker, producer and director; there is a very good chance that you\u2019ll spot him, camera in hand, at any big championship fight. \u201cBoxing\u201d says Leifer \u201cis the one sport I still love shooting.\u201d<\/p> <p>Adorama is located at 42 West 18th Street, NYC.

Fans can expect to hear the group's greatest hits along with work from their more current CD releases. Continuing the legacy of the late Juan Formell, his son Samuel, the band's artistic director, has left no doubt that the group will follow the footsteps of his father.

Here, take a closer look at concepts that were once unexplainable but, thanks to modern physics, are now better understood. You\u2019ll focus on two such former mysteries: the existence of an invisible \u201caether\u201d through which light and sound were believed to travel and the orbit of Mercury, which seemed (to earlier scientists) to violate Newton\u2019s fundamental laws of motion.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe know a lot about the universe. But there\u2019s even more that we <i>don\u2019t<\/i> know,\u201d says astrophysicist and Professor Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium, an award-winning lecturer, and one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on the secrets of the universe. And his course The Inexplicable Universe: Unsolved Mysteries is the perfect gateway into this mind-bending and eye-opening subject. This visually stunning course, which has been honored with a 2013 Telly Award for Outstanding Educational Program, features six self-contained lectures that transport you on a marvelous journey to the frontiers of the known (and unknown) universe and introduce you to tantalizing questions being addressed by the world\u2019s top scientists. Undeniably engaging and fascinating, this lecture series is a wonderful entr\u00e9e to scientific pursuits that lie at the very heart of the history and nature of our universe.<\/p> <p><b>All Are Welcome!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/224408640\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Circle of Spiritual Inquiry - Mystical Movie Night: The Inexplicable Universe","id":"fpbtflytlbcc","time":1440196200000,"updated":1440208381000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":28,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":17,"created":1438393607000,"fee":{"amount":7,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u2022\u00a0<b>ABSOLUTELY NO CLEATS ALLOWED (for both real grass and artificial grass)!

Amazingly, he didn\u2019t reproduce known paintings, but, working in an artist\u2019s style, would create entirely new \u201cmasterpieces.\u201d A large Max Ernst that took him three days to produce could sell for $5 million. Beltracchi was put on trial in 2011, but readily admits that the handful of forgeries he was held accountable for are just the tip of the iceberg. Many others sit in some of the world\u2019s greatest art museums and private collections. This documentary captures his unique personality: a bizarre mix of candor and cunning, insouciance and joie de vivre.<\/p> <p>GERMANY \u2022 2014 \u2022 93 MINS. \u2022 IN GERMAN WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES \u2022 KIMSTIM<\/p> <p><b>Reviews<\/b><\/p> <p>\u201cWithout a doubt he is the biggest forger of our times.\u201d<br\/>\u2013 Vanity Fair<\/p> <p>\u201cA highly enjoyable look at a career spent duping the art world.

Jake and Reno investigate a plot by domestic terrorists to attack a conference on unity.

From respected scientist to miracle worker to man on the run,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/milland-p102824\">Milland<\/a>'s turn as the tortured scientist provides the film with a believable lead and a solid foundation.

He can usually be found in smart overalls and a starched white shirt buttoned to the top, with a pocket watch and fob and either a derby hat or yarmulke topping his cherubic face.

He has received great acclaim in the New York City restaurant scene, including being named one of Zagat\u2019s \u201c19 NYC Restaurant Power Players You Need to Know,\u201d and winning Esquire\u2019s \u201cBest New Restaurant in America 2014,\u201d for The Cecil. As the Executive Chef, Co-owner and Creator of the newly reopened Minton\u2019s Supper Club and its award-winning sister restaurant, The Cecil, Alexander endeavors to entertain the world. He is joined in these recent restaurant projects, which fall under the Harlem Jazz Enterprises umbrella by Chef de Cuisine Joseph \u201cJJ\u201d Johnson and partners, Dick and Laura Parsons.<\/p> <p>Alexander has successfully introduced New Yorkers to his brand of hospitality and New American Cuisine, which he refers to as Afro-Asian-American Cooking at The Cecil and Southern Revival Cooking, at Minton\u2019s. Southern Revival cooking is Alexander\u2019s interpretation of Low Country Cooking, which is a culinary discipline that he developed for his three previously popular and highly regarded restaurants, Caf\u00e9 Beulah, Sweet Ophelia\u2019s, and The Shoebox Caf\u00e9, also in New York City.<\/p> <p>Alexander has spent the last twenty-five years traveling the world and studying the cooking techniques, cultures and \u201cfood-ways\u201d of the African diaspora. Through the course of his travels, he has developed a unique insight and passion for the influence of the migrating people of Africa and how through their culinary efforts, they changed the palate of our global expression.<\/p> <p>Those lessons form the foundation of his Harlem based restaurant, The Cecil, which is the first Afro-Asian-American brasserie in the world. In January of 2015, Alexander was invited by The James Beard Foundation to present his culinary exploration of the African Diaspora to a sold-out audience at The Beard House with chef Joseph JJ Johnson.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b> <b>As always: <\/b><\/p> <p>Please don't RSVP unless you are sure you can go. I do notice the people who RSVP and then cancel which really isn't fair to everyone else. I reserve the right to give priority to people who don't do this in the future. I'm not trying to be mean or anything but it makes it much harder for me when people take spots and then cancel either quickly or last minute. Obviously more notice is better but please try to only sign up (for waitlist as well) if you know you can come.<\/p> <p>Also even if the meetup is full please do put your name on the waitlist. I always give priority to people on the waitlist if spots open up. I will also try to give an idea in advance if it looks like there might be more spots. Also, if there are a lot of people on the waitlist I will try to get more seats, although for reservations made far in advance I am unlikely to succeed. At very least it will let me know what kinds of restaurants are popular so I can schedule more of those in the future.

large rooms.\u00a0 There are two vertical drop-offs where a ladder is needed.\u00a0 These are formerly The Ice Caves of Chimney Mountain.\u00a0 Until recent years, there was year-round ice, so it is much colder than you imagine.\u00a0 Bring some layers, so you don't freeze when we stop moving.\u00a0 It is a common story that people wander in the mid-levels for hours, until their last battery is dead, and they wait in darkness for someone to happen upon them and show them the way out.\u00a0 So the group will be small.\u00a0 We will stay together.\u00a0 And you will be asked to stay behind if you do not have the required gear. \u00a0That being said, the cave is very accessible with the proper gear, and though I don't recommend it, we'll probably see other groups down there with young children.<\/p> <p>If backpacking, you will be carrying our camping gear and all the water we'll need for two days to the top of the mountain.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you join this meetup you will be

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Participants are briefly walked through their bodies while sitting quietly. A period of silent follows\u00a0for 20-25 minutes. Whenever the mind wanders and seeks out a satisfaction outside of the self, the meditator steers consciousness back to her breath. In this way we practice mindfulness, focus, and discernment. The mind simplifies its activities as the body relaxes.<\/p> <p>Meditation is easy to do but, like most simple things, mastery requires regular practice. Most anyone who practices the technique once a day will note its transformative effect on their life. Meditation makes you ready to be happy and content.<\/p> <p>The sangha at Heights Meditation is a friendly and open-hearted group. Please come visit us if meditation seems attractive or necessary to you in your life or if you have had trouble establishing and keeping up your meditation practice as a lone agent!<\/p> <p>If you have any questions, please contact us at [masked] or take a look at our main website at HeightsMeditation.com.

In turn, diseases related to poor nutrition \u2013 including diabetes and heart disease \u2013 tend to be concentrated where demand for emergency food is greatest.<\/p> <p>As a natural extension of the anti-hunger work we began more than 30 years ago, City Harvest developed\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods\u00a0programs to respond to the need for emergency food, improve access to fruits and vegetables for residents in low-income communities and provide nutrition education that will inspire affordable, healthy meal choices. Through our\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods\u00a0programs, City Harvest partners with residents, community organizations, afterschool programs, and local businesses. Together we work to achieve a long-term impact in the fight against hunger by engaging residents in healthy choices and enhancing the local food landscape. Building off our nutrition education classes which began in 2000, and our Mobile Markets which began in 2004, City Harvest has since expanded\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoodsprograms to high-need communities across the five boroughs.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"At the location given","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HarlemGo\/events\/224233282\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":12600000,"name":"Volunteer Opportunity: City Harvest Mobile Market - Hamilton Heights","id":"224233282","time":1440247500000,"updated":1440374464000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344731038000,"name":"HarlemGo Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":4524292,"urlname":"HarlemGo","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Goers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":33,"headcount":0,"distance":2.81856846809,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":15,"created":1427308350000,"fee":{"amount":8.85000038147,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi everyone,<\/p> <p>Please be there\u00a0on time so you can get set up, and bring a white and a red t-shirt.<\/p> <p>If this game is full click\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Soccer-Pickup\/events\/\">here<\/a> for\u00a0our calendar and see other game slots!<\/p> <p>Thank you,<\/p> <p>Paul<\/p> <p>Details Below:<\/p> <p>------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p><b>Game style and Rules:<\/b><\/p> <p>1.

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p>We'll play 3 simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with goals. There will be 6 teams on the field and we will play three games, 30 minutes\/game. Every 30 minutes we will have a short break and teams will switch to play against different team. Please check your email or our meetup message board on friday night or before 12.00pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p>If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.<\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>Riverside Park\u00a0at West\u00a0107 &amp; 108 Street<\/p> <p>Take the 1 RED Line Train to Cathedral Pkwy an walk two blocks down,\u00a0to 108th Street and Riverside Dr.<\/p> <p>The field is down the lower level near the river.

From here we cycle through the shore nabes of Red Bank, and tony Rumson and Middletown, home to some of the rich and famous including Jon Bon Jovi, John Stewart, and Bruce Springsteen. Pedal on we will, all the way to Sandy Hook. What will we find there? A 1,600 acre peninsula encompassing a seven-mile stretch of spectacular ocean and bay beaches, a cycling path that winds us through pristine holly forests and salt marshes, a defunct U.S army post -- Fort Hancock, abandoned gun batteries to explore, and a decommissioned Nike missile installation.<\/p> <p>After exploring Sandy Hook on our bikes we'll park our rides and spend a few hours on the sand shooting the breeze and enjoying the weather.

<p>I'm\u00a0interrupting\u00a0this posting with a special message for newbies!<\/p> <p>I am genuinely excited by the number of hyper excited newbies who saw this paddle and have tried to sign on. \u00a0We usually try to do a better job of getting people to self select out of things that are above their abilities while encouraging them to challenge themselves. \u00a0In this case, we just assumed that you all would know that a 30 mile paddle that is going to take you 10 hours of reasonably hard work in a relatively harsh environment is way beyond where newbies should be aiming. \u00a0I am sorry for that but I remain excited because I think we have a bumper crop of great new members this year and I can't wait to spend time with you all.<\/p> <p>In an email exchange Ralph and I were a little mind boggled as to how people could try to sign up for something like this without a fair amount of experience. \u00a0It's become apparent to me as I have corresponded with a few of you that you're certainly not without lots of merit. \u00a0You're bright, articulate individuals with a fair amount of athletic talent and a whole bunch of spirit who just don't know what something like this paddle entails.<\/p> <p>So to help you all out here are a few parameters to help you figure out if this is right for you. \u00a0First of all you have to have your own boat. \u00a0There are no rentals available for the circumnavigation. \u00a0Your boat really must have two sealed bulkheads and be at least 14 feet long although some less wise than me would suggest even longer. \u00a0 You need to be well versed in wet exits, as well as self and assisted rescues. \u00a0It shouldn't take you more than 90 seconds to get back in your boat if you fall out a few miles from shore.<\/p> <p>You also need the time to train a little bit for something like this. \u00a0You should be doing a few paddles at least 20 miles in length in August before the event. \u00a0Paddling 20 miles with poor technique can be exhausting so you should probably have some good training on proper paddling technique. \u00a0There are more experienced paddlers that need to realize they need to do some additional distance training for this paddle too.<\/p> <p>Fortunately, you can get everything you need right here at CKA but trying to put it all together by August is something that very few newbies will be able to do regardless of how much of a quick study they are or how great their athletic ability. \u00a0How about aiming for the circumnavigation next year. \u00a0Until then I will be removing you from this paddle if you don't do so yourself.<\/p> <p>Chuck<\/p> <p>**********************************************************************************<\/p> <p>\n\nAnd now back to our regularly scheduled

Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds. 6. Subs will enter the game no later than 6 points in (once one of the teams reaches 6 points). The sub will start the following game.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

The 2015 AFROPUNK Festival, whose lineup includes Lenny Kravitz, Grace Jones, Ms. Lauryn Hill, Kelis, Danny Brown, Suicidal Tendencies, Thundercat, GoldLink, Kaytranada, Curtis Harding and many more (full lineup below) will be the biggest undertaking of the critically acclaimed festival yet. Preemptively AFROPUNK will be throwing their first annual AFROPUNK FANCY DRESS BALL w\/ special guest Grace Jones and more TBD to raise funds for their AFROPUNK Global Initiative: an alliance dedicated to moving the needle of progress closer to a holistic, democratic and enlightened representation of people of color within all facets of society with the goal to create unique programming that encourages diversity in media. The AFROPUNK FANCY DRESS BALL will take place August 21st at Commodore Barry Park.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/>Due to the amount of attendees (60,000 last year) the festival has now moved to an affordable paid and earned ticket to the event to assure entry. AFROPUNK has been long known as an advocate of cultural change as well as change directly in the Brooklyn community. The earned ticket program, called AFROPUNK Army, expounds upon that giving fans the chance to volunteer for the earned ticket. AFROPUNK will work closely with partners to provide low barrier volunteer activities and projects for youth to complete in exchange for a ticket to the festival. The volunteer program will create awareness for organizations in need, provide access to an engaged pool of valuable resources and help deliver a sustainable impact to communities. Sample projects include landscaping (beautification, painting), packing supplies (meal prep, serving) and advocacy via social promotion. PAID \/ EARNED TICKETS AVAILABLE FROM WEDNESDAY JUNE 3RD.

In this school, we focus in \u2018whole-body strength emission\u2019. In the area of self-defense, this is of major importance, since one wants to hit an attacker as hard and as fast as possible, and incapacitate him\/her within three seconds, in order to save our lives; while maintaining internal equanimity and control. However, most people respond to life-threatening attacks with only the strength of their arms or legs, as opposed to the strength of their whole bodies. Therefore, our responses to attacks are significantly hampered, and our chances of survival get drastically minimized.<\/p> <p>Erle Montaigue\u2019s Fajing Quan System of Fighting and Healing is the system of training created by Erle Montaigue, the founder of the World Taiji Boxing Association, in order to develop true whole-body fajing, the method of movement through which we engage every joint in our body in perfect coordination in an explosive manner, delivering full-body strikes into our opponent (think about how much you weigh, as opposed to only the weight of your arm or your leg).\u00a0<\/p> <p>This desired response is achieved by accessing our reptilian brain, which has been sophisticated through one\u2019s training, and operate from it in the event of an attack, as opposed to operate from our cerebral cortex\/human brain, which processes information slower by trying to understand logically what is happening. Our reptilian brain acts only on reflexes, which are deeply engrained in our nervous system; so our training will come out just as another learnt reflex, like muscle memory.<\/p> <p>This ability to fajing will be useful also in the healing arts, by emitting healing energy through the same method, in a soft, non-explosive way (Yin-Yang uses of a core, unique principle).<\/p> <p>The training consist on:<\/p> <p>- 8 Wudang Stepping Methods<\/p> <p>- 12 Wudang Hand Weapons Drills<\/p> <p>- Small San Sau Self-Defense Form<\/p> <p>- One Hand Yang Style Martial Push Hands<\/p> <p>- Entering Methods<\/p> <p>- Internal and External Mechanics for Striking\/Kicking\/Punching<\/p> <p>- Wudang Knife Forms<\/p> <p>- Introduction to Dim Mak<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Contact info: 646-820-8653","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/WTBANYC\/events\/223889593\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"WTBA's Fajing Quan - Erle Montaigue's System of Fighting and Healing","id":"dfxrhlytlbdc","time":1440259200000,"updated":1440268374000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1401724195000,"name":"World Taiji Boxing Association - New York City","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":14829442,"urlname":"WTBANYC","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11201","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn ","address_1":"Tillary St and Cadman Plaza W ","name":"Cadman Plaza (Turf Fields) ","lon":-73.99128,"id":15573482,"state":"NY","lat":40.696358,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":18,"headcount":0,"distance":3.71463751793,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":2,"created":1430809343000,"fee":{"amount":4,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a co-ed adult pick-up game 6v6 or 7 v7 depending on attendance. 90 minutes with two 45 minute halves.\u00a0No slide tackling or rough play.\u00a0We play with Pugg goals.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

The first 30 minutes of the session will discuss our approach to treating the human figure as a series of simple shapes to more easily represent it. We will briefly discuss foreshortening and why it is important for students to go on to study anatomy. (This is not an anatomy class.)<\/p> <p><b>Gesture Drawing:<\/b> What is it and why do we practice it? Students will approach gesture drawing two different ways. \u00a0This is an essential part of figure drawing.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Figure Drawing:<\/b>\u00a0What is our goal when drawing 5-10 minute poses? There is a great deal we can do in these medium length poses if only we set ourselves goals in the time allotted. We will practice two different approaches to these poses.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Long Poses:<\/b>\u00a0We will practice at least two long poses. Many of us run out of things to draw in longer poses. We grow bored and stop \u201cthinking\u201d while we work. With a proper focus we will find that these long poses will actually feel very brief to us.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Critique:<\/b> Drawings of willing students will be shown and discussed. We will talk about successes and what we can do to improve in the future. The goal of a good critique is not to criticize students but to point out future goals where they can improve. This allows them to leave the session eager to continue drawing and improving.<\/p> <p><b>Material requirements:<\/b> 16x20 inch sketch or drawing pad (not newsprint.) 2H, HB and 4B pencils.

This is our furthest Uptown meetup yet. OSA is short for Our Saviour's Attonement (Lutheran Church), however, do not let that dissuade you if you follow a certain religion -our use of the community center is of no religious affiliation! This is a Saturday afternoon of tabletop gaming, welcome to all. RSVP as soon as you can commit, because space is limited to 30 people!<\/p> <p>If you haven't attended our other meetups, you can expect to play tabletop games of all sorts; examples include Carcassonne, The Resistance, Castles of Burgundy, Settlers of Catan, Lords of Waterdeep, Agricola, Through the Ages, etc. Feel free to bring any games that you'd like to play with other Uptown Gamers.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our group is renting this space, so, unlike our other meetups to date, I will have to collect an 8 dollar contribution upon attendance. This will be a good venue for our group because we will not feel obligated to buy food or drinks as we do when we have events at bars\/restaurants. The good news, though, is that we are allowed to bring food and (non-alcoholic) beverages into the space, as long as we clean up after ourselves.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our space will be through the southern entrance, and up the stairs in the balcony room. The space is well lit, and has nice folding tables and chairs which will be very conducive to table top gaming. As I mentioned before, the space is limited to 30 people, so I'd ask that you do not RSVP unless you are reasonably certain that you can attend -this is also important because of the contributions that we'll need to collect in order to keep renting this center.<\/p> <p>As I mentioned before, this is our first meetup at this venue, and I am considering this a trial run; if it goes well, I believe that we will be able to do this once a month. So, if you're interested, please make an effort to come out to this meetup so we can continue to foster our Uptown gaming community!<\/p> <p>As always, Uptown Gamers Unite!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Uptown-NYC-Board-Gamers\/events\/224153119\/","yes_rsvp_count":29,"duration":14400000,"name":"Tabletop Games At OSA Community Center","id":"224153119","time":1440270000000,"updated":1440428556000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1431454519000,"name":"Uptown NYC Board Gamers","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18592892,"urlname":"Uptown-NYC-Board-Gamers","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Uptown Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":25,"headcount":0,"distance":14.8351278305,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438737873000,"rating":{"count":5,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/f\/9\/3\/600_440564947.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>A repeat of a fantastic evening of last summer .....

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

Since this event will be posted as a last minute hike to AMC club members, there is NO need for AMC club members to RSVP for this-unless you don\u2019t get last minute e-mails. Let\u2019s leave 10 spaces for AMC Meetup members. Needless to say, please take the RSVP process seriously and be considerate. If you have been a NO SHOW on any previous AMC Meetup events that I have led or are a chronic abuser of the RSVP process \u2013see your Attendance History- please do not sign up for this event because I am just going to delete your RSVP. Let someone else go who will actually show up.\u00a0<\/p> <p>PRIORITY WILL BE GIVEN TO THOSE WHO HAVE PREVIOUSLY ATTENDED OTHER AMC MEETUP EVENTS.<\/p> <p>I am going to ask that people not post any comments or questions prior to the event. You have more than enough information to do this once you get the meeting details. No offense, but I don\u2019t need to know-and probably neither does anyone else- what you are doing that day if you can\u2019t make it or what you think the weather will be. AFTER the event, post as many comments and photos as you like.<\/p> <p>If the weather forecast is really bad, See Accuweather like I do, I will post a notice on the day of the hike by 1:00 P.M. If there is no notice, we go. We will finish around 10:00 p.m.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Appalachian-Mountain-Club-New-York-North-Jersey\/events\/224663913\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Sunset Hike On the Waterfront-and More!","id":"224663913","time":1440283500000,"updated":1440298874000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1351543614000,"name":"Appalachian Mountain Club New York-North Jersey","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":5616472,"urlname":"Appalachian-Mountain-Club-New-York-North-Jersey","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"AMC Hikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"150 West 28th street suite 1803","name":"The Institute of Core Energetics","lon":-73.992821,"id":24021454,"state":"NY","lat":40.746761,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.268773138523,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439321074000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Take A Risk SEX is an experiential event where you take a risk to share and explore an aspect of your sexuality.\u00a0<\/p> <p>When we experience ourselves as sexual beings, open to our full flow, pulsing with life energy through our body, we become more creative and feel more deeply connected to ourselves and to others. In this dynamic, interactive evening combining individual work with group process, you will learn techniques to liberate this energy and access more pleasure in your life. These techniques will be demonstrated through individual body readings with select participants who choose to take the risk of revealing a sexual issue and are willing to work through it in a supportive environment with expert guidance.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Dr. Kincaid uses the teachings of Integral Evolutionary Tantra and the principles of Core Energetics to open up physical blocks and places where life energy doesn\u2019t move.

Among the profusion of Latino restaurants, most do not offer the kind of atmosphere diners from out of town might expect. Of all these restaurants, <b>Acuario is the one that best retains the exotic feeling of authenticity, while providing an attractive ambience, without prices that take it out of the \"affordable\" category. The ceviche here is the best in town.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Here are some comments by others, \"Yesterday was our second time at Acuario and it confirmed that the first time was not an anomaly- the food and overall experience is of a consistently high quality. My wife loves the ceviche mariscos, and my Milanesa de Pollo was moist and tasty. I would highly recommend getting a side of tostones, they were excellent. My daughter always gets the tallarines verde con bistek, basically fettuccine with pesto and steak, another great dish. On our first visit I had the Pollo Encebollado and it was a very nice combination of flavors.\u00a0It's a fairly busy restaurant so be prepared for some noise during peak hours, but this adds to the overall atmosphere of festivity. They have a full bar and the Peruvian beer Cusquena (which I've never seen at my local store) was very good.\u00a0Highly recommended, a great family restaurant with something for everyone. While there are cheaper Peruvian options out there I haven't found one with better tasting dishes, and that's worth paying a little more for.\"<\/p> <p>Another writes, \"Can I give it 10 stars?? Cause if I could I would!!!! \u00a0Seared Scallops......Cooked to utter perfection.\u00a0Steak that you can cut with a butter knife.\u00a0Fried Yuca which I already love, so it doesn't take much to woo me with that one.\u00a0Papa Huancaina...........I can't even explain this one, but if you have never had it you're missing out on one of the wonders of the world. Lol \u00a0And the little spicy dipping sauce that they give you with the bread. \u00a0OMG \u00a0Lastly, the salad dressing. It's homemade and made me feel like I died and went to heaven.\u00a0Go, go, go. \u00a0If you're still reading this you have already wasted enough time.\u00a0Enjoy it. \u00a0I promise you will savor every bite!!!!!\"<\/p> <p>And one more says, \"I just went this restaurant tonight for the first time ever. There were two of us.\u00a0We had the Mixto Ceviche with medium spice. It was delicious! Amazing. Freshest seafood. The large was more than enough for two and extremely filling for the two of us. \u00a0We barely had enough room for our entrees of Cau Cau and the pesto bistec. They were good, but we did not have enough room because of the ceviche. Took it to go.Service was great. We have Laura, who was attentive and pleasant. \u00a0Ambiance was okay. A little too dark for me, but my boyfriend said it was fine. \u00a0Above all, ceviche was worth everything.
