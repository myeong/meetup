Brain Body Mastery has two main components. One is <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mindfulness\">mindfulness<\/a> and other types of meditation, or low stimulus attention control, meaning focusing in a slow and quiet way. The other component is high stimulus attention control, which is about taking simple movements and brain exercises, and integrating them into complex, whole brain activities. They are usually done at faster speed and can demand a fair amount of physical and mental effort. <br> <\/p>\n<p>The following videos explain what this group is about better than any of what's written here, but scroll down if you'd like to read more of what's behind all this.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9a8Mz5lWzjg\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9a8Mz5lWzjg<\/a> <br><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BJT00Qdjpuk&amp;amp;list=UUQThuzMvIkqC8wcVjTMjQFg\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_uPWHXFEwy4\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_uPWHXFEwy4<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aNsNIqRVeDc&amp;index=20&amp;list=UUQThuzMvIkqC8wcVjTMjQFg\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aNsNIqRVeDc&amp;index=20&amp;list=UUQThuzMvIkqC8wcVjTMjQFg<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sign up for the FREE self-paced online course here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.effortwise.info\">www.effortwise.info<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span>The beauty of BrBd is that anyone can create new exercises. All it takes is curiosity and a little effort. Find two or more simple, separate activities and integrate them into one, and you grow your brain. Practice mindfulness or meditation, and you grow your brain. Even just practice being curious once in a while, and usually your brain grows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The goal of BrBd is to be as <b>in control of our conscious energy<\/b> as possible. The implications reach far beyond just performing better at work or school. The more control you have over how your mind functions, the more quickly you can learn new skills, the more creative you can be, the more relaxed and present you can be, meaning you make better decisions. Aside from the longer term benefits, practicing just makes ya feel good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For more on the subject of skill learning, here is a page from my website on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.effortwise.com\/insights-from-research.html\">how to master anything<\/a>.<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/4\/2\/highres_427608962.jpeg","photo_id":427608962,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/4\/2\/600_427608962.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/4\/2\/thumb_427608962.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":128312972,"name":"David Wolovsky"},"members":407,"name":"Brain Body Mastery","id":17933752,"state":"NY","urlname":"Brain-Body-Mastery","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Brain Body Masters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1414563863000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"chinese-culture","name":"Chinese Culture","id":33004},{"urlkey":"mandarin-language","name":"Mandarin Language","id":51192},{"urlkey":"learning-chinese","name":"Learning Chinese","id":56708}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ChinesePod-New-York-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"Come hangout , meet other Poddies and share your Mandarin Learning Journey","lon":-74,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":173938982,"name":"Fiona Tian"},"members":35,"name":"ChinesePod New York Group","id":17935762,"state":"NY","urlname":"ChinesePod-New-York-Group","category":{"name":"language\/ethnic identity","id":16,"shortname":"language"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Chinese Learners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"West New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1414583651000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"business","name":"Business","id":10575},{"urlkey":"career-network","name":"Career Network","id":15556},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"bni","name":"BNI","id":17157},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-networking-international-bni","name":"Business Networking International (BNI)","id":22878},{"urlkey":"bni-business-based-on-professional-relationships","name":"BNI - Business based on professional relationships","id":47292},{"urlkey":"b2b-networking","name":"B2B Networking","id":65792}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BNI-Gold-Coast-Professional-Networking-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>If you're looking to grow your business, there is no better way than network referral marketing.

We strive not only for martial skill but also for awareness and discipline, things that are largely not emphasized in today's society, through the Kung Fu system of Lak Sao Chuan Fa. Our system teaches martial techniques as well as philosophy and healing. Our school is our home and safety is our highest priority. We welcome individuals of all genders and skill levels.

I have moderate scoliosis, and I decided to start one. If alcoholics have AA and drug addicts have NA, and there are support groups for a slew of other types of mental health and health issues, it's about time scoliosis got a support group of its own. We suffer too, don't we? Doesn't our condition impact our lives in significant ways, mentally and physically?<\/p>\n<p>The only place where I read about the spiritual-psychological aspect of scoliosis was in a text written by Katharina Schroth, who founded the Schroth Method of scoliosis treatment in the early 20th Century (<a class=\"linkified\" href=\"http:\/\/www.scoliosisjournal.com\/content\/6\/1\/17\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.scoliosisjournal.com\/content\/6\/1\/17<\/a>):<\/p>\n<p>\"Curvature of the spine, or scoliosis, is a precarious formal defect in terms of health, appearance, and the spiritual-psychological aspect. When attempting to help a scoliotic with this defect, we must not view the matter primarily from the mechanical standpoint, namely the malfunctioning body. For we have before us not a mechanical structure of bony levers and the muscles that move them, but rather an unfortunate person who has lost the form originally created for her and who cannot restore it by herself. With all scoliotic people, the cause probably lies partly in the mental realm. Envision what the expression \"not in good form\" means. Imagine the mental state of a child scolded by his mother. The psychic depression and loss of equilibrium are immediately visible in his abnormal bodily form. How wonderful the form of a little child's body is! What a victorious, natural, matter-of-fact nature he has in the representation of his Self, and in every movement and in all of his life statements.<\/p>\n<p>However, let us observe a school class three or four years later. What has happened to these children? Almost all are missing their original sense of complete, untroubled comfort within. Many children have pronounced signs of suffering in their faces, and their depressed mental state finds expression in their bodies.<\/p>\n<p>Why do gymnastic attempts to erect such a troubled child often fail completely? It is because they approach the child much too mechanically, much too much in the form of exercises, without first becoming familiar with his life difficulties, his unfulfilled needs, which to the adult may seem trivial. Straightening of the external person will only succeed when we can erect the inner person, open an avenue of hope, and allow him to breathe a sigh of relief.\" (Lehnert-Schroth, Christa, P.T. Three-Dimensional Treatment for Scoliosis, page 5)<\/p>\n<p>Also, I must credit this video for inspiring me to move forward with this group: <a class=\"linkified\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yGLzpt3caHw\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yGLzpt3caHw<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Physical therapists can't help us deal with the mental issues that are getting in the way of our exercises, which in many cases renders the exercises useless. I believe a support group made up of other people with scoliosis is a crucial way of trying to address the psycho-spiritual contributors\u00a0of this condition.<\/p>","lon":-74,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12666154,"name":"Evelyn"},"members":24,"name":"Scoliosis Support Group","id":17994992,"state":"NY","urlname":"Scoliosis-Support-Group","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1414861657000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"spanish","name":"Spanish Language","id":183},{"urlkey":"italian","name":"Italian Language","id":184},{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"italian-culture","name":"Italian Culture","id":15028},{"urlkey":"spanish-culture","name":"Spanish Culture","id":19169},{"urlkey":"french-culture","name":"French Culture","id":21183},{"urlkey":"language-exchange","name":"Language Exchange","id":26212},{"urlkey":"francophiles","name":"Francophiles","id":27564},{"urlkey":"italian-lessons","name":"Italian Lessons","id":29637},{"urlkey":"learn-to-speak-french","name":"Learn to Speak French","id":43377},{"urlkey":"learn-to-speak-italian","name":"Learn to Speak Italian","id":45489},{"urlkey":"learning-french","name":"Learning French","id":46786},{"urlkey":"learning-spanish","name":"Learning Spanish","id":50595},{"urlkey":"spanish-lessons","name":"Spanish lessons","id":51717},{"urlkey":"french-lessons","name":"French Lessons","id":82861}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Learn-to-Speak-FRENCH-ITALIAN-SPANISH-in-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for people interested in learning FRENCH, ITALIAN, and SPANISH language and culture in NYC!

It creates a new economic paradigm built on distributed networks of connected individuals and communities rather than on centralized institutions. (You may have heard people refer to it as collaborative consumption, the peer economy and the collaborative economy.) This new economic model is changing our daily lives, our communities, what it means to have a \u201cjob,\u201d our cities, and the planet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>The NY Sharing Economy Meetup is a collaborative organization driven by its members.

Why article rather than book discussion group then? A book discussion group is not for people who take books seriously, i.e.\u00a0\u201chave a sense of purpose for reading\u201d (Daniel Bell). They cannot take a detour from the reading path defined by their own questions and interests even for sake of finding people they speak the same language with. An article discussion group allows finding people of the same quality as a book group while making much lesser demand on your reading time.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>A serious magazine or newspaper seems to be the only place where you can find intelligent life in public space. Good periodicals might be the only link between people who think. This is the reason for creating the meetup.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n This group is for readers who from time to time come across a fascinating article and want to discuss it with others both for better understanding of things and for pleasure of being with people who share your interests.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n I am talking about an occasional outstanding article with eye-opening analysis or a review of a great book (just published or classic), not about daily reporting.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n For sake of describing this group I\u2019d like to restate the obvious - a few of many things that one may get from a good newspaper if he goes past news:<br>\n\n 1. Understanding political world we live in - insightful analysis of major issues of politics \u2013 both domestic and foreign;<br>\n\n 2. Opportunity to hear people with greater wisdom and knowledge than your own (in our interactions in person we are usually limited to people of our own level);<br>\n\n 3. Invaluable tips for continuing study of Humanities on your own;<br>\n\n 4. Knowledge for dealing with earthly problems of our lives.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n It is easy to miss and never discover articles and tips about books that would be of most interest to you or even \u201cchange your life\u201d because there are too many worthy newspapers and magazines for one person to keep up with. It is another reason for this meetup.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Articles will not be limited to current ones. Selection criteria are topic and quality - publication date does not matter \u2013 we will be discussing pieces that are \u201ctimeless\u201d.<br>\n\n A sample list of articles that follows this description will give you an idea of what kind of things we may discuss. People with a different range of interests who like the idea of this group may want to create meetups that reflect their interests.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Technically this group is limited to discussion of articles, but in reality it should allow discussing any topic that may interest you because over years your favorite newspapers and magazines most likely have had an article on anything you can ever think of.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Periodicals do have online forums, but they are a poor ersatz for a conversation in person and a poor tool for selecting people to talk to (before joining this meetup you will be offered a few questions to determine if the group matches your interests). Unfortunately there are no gathering places for those who want to meet people to discuss works of journalism. This group is designed to serve a role of such place.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>Basics on how the group will operate<\/b><br>\n\n 1. The leader will select an article (or a few) for a discussion using recommendations of the group and his own findings and post the selection approximately two weeks before a meeting. In addition to discussing articles we may want to share tips about articles and books that we find interesting.<br>\n\n 2. We will restrict freedom of speech by a 2-3 min. limit per person per comment except instances when the group wants to hear more. Taking numbers might be another good idea.<br>\n\n 3. Initial plan is to meet once a month \u2013 most likely we will be meeting on Mondays.<br>\n\n 4. Meetings will be held in Manhattan.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>Sample articles<\/b><br>\n\n List of abbreviations:<br>\n\n NYT - New Your Times<br>\n\n WSJ \u2013 Wall Street Journal<br>\n\n FT \u2013 Financial Times<br>\n\n<br>\n\n 0.\u00a0The Truth About Our Libertarian Age By Mark Lilla -\u00a0newrepublic.com June 17, 2014<br>\n\n 1.

It\u2019s a 2-1\/2 hour drawing session with social time before. &nbsp;Everyone cleans up after.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Full nudity of all participants is required for the duration of the session.&nbsp;Tuesday venue: footwear is recommended when not on the model stand.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; All artists should be willing to pose on the model stand. First-timers are not required to pose. There are usually more artists than posing slots so not everyone will pose. Sign up for single\/duo\/3-person poses. Erotic\/sensual poses on the model stand welcome.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Creating interesting poses is the group\u2019s collective responsibility. Each artist should think about his possible poses in advance while the other artists should offer friendly suggestions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; There is no instruction. Bring all your own materials, drawing boards, portable easels, etc. There is a sink available for rinsing your brushes.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Artists are encouraged to share their work by taping their work to the wall as the session progresses. We will photograph drawings to post on social media. We want this to be social (not formal). While we want to improve our artwork, we want to have fun doing it. Don't forget to take your drawings home with you!<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Photography of persons without permission is prohibited.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Sexual activity prohibited anywhere in the building; this is not a hook-up event.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Bring a towel or sit on your shirt.

Is there any instruction? There is no instruction, but beginner artists are welcome to try us out as long as you have the interest and make the effort to draw. There will be special sessions with instruction from a naked teacher; please check the schedule.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; I've never been to a naked event before. What's it like?&nbsp;We're a friendly bunch and like most naturists, nonjudgmental. We have a wide range of ages and body types. Everyone gets fully undressed (except possibly for footwear) after checking in\/paying the fee and stays naked for the entire session. It's quite natural and relaxed.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Do I need to bring my own supplies? What is provided? You must bring all your own supplies (paper\/pads, pencils, drawing boards, easels, etc). Most guys draw on pads on their laps. The studio provides chairs, and running water.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; I've never posed before. Many of our members had never posed before joining our group. We're a friendly and relaxed group, so no need to stress out about it. It might be easier to pose together with someone else to start. We have 2-person poses to accommodate this. Not everyone poses every session. We have about 10-15 posing slots per session and we usually have about 20 attendees. There is a sign up sheet for poses (varying lengths 5-20mins) at the beginning of each session and guys sign up for what they want to do.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Who keeps the drawings that I posed for?&nbsp;Each artist keeps his own drawings. The model can ask for\/trade\/buy other artists' drawings.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; What's the sexual energy of the group like?&nbsp;The sexual energy level varies quite a bit depending on who shows up.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; What's an erotic pose?&nbsp;Poses are&nbsp;up to each artist posing.&nbsp;They can be classical, athletic, dance-like, sexy, etc. Erotic poses can simulate sexual acts like masturbating, etc. We're open-minded but remember that some artists don't like the model(s) to move&nbsp;too much. We're a naked drawing group where erotic poses welcome but not required.&nbsp;Try to find the right balance. It's not a performance piece. Each venue has different guidelines on what's acceptable - this will be announced before each session.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; What if I get an erection?&nbsp;Erections are natural and are welcome. However, when you're socializing or supposed to be drawing, masturbating is not okay.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Is this a gay group?&nbsp;Many of our members are gay, but we are open to men regardless of sexual orientation. In fact, we don't talk about it much. As you can see by the questions above, some artists create poses that are homoerotic so you should be comfortable with that.<\/p>\n<p>Organized by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/shungaboy\">Shungaboy<\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>Our social media:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Our Website:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/mndgny.com\/\">http:\/\/mndgny.com...<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Our Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MNDGNY\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/M...<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Our Facebook Page:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mndgny\">https:\/\/www.facebook....<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Our Wordpress Blog:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/mndgny.wordpress.com\/\">http:\/\/mndgny.wordpre...<\/a><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><i>Updated 7\/28\/2015<\/i><\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/c\/4\/highres_432143748.jpeg","photo_id":432143748,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/c\/4\/600_432143748.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/c\/4\/thumb_432143748.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":16687501,"name":"Shungaboy"},"members":215,"name":"Men's Naked Drawing Group NY","id":18232572,"state":"NY","urlname":"Mens-Naked-Drawing-Group-NY","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Naked Artists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1417727340000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"selfdefense","name":"Self-Defense","id":443},{"urlkey":"martial","name":"Martial Arts","id":681},{"urlkey":"kali","name":"Kali","id":10041},{"urlkey":"mixed-martial-arts","name":"Mixed Martial Arts","id":15514},{"urlkey":"knife-fighting","name":"Knife Fighting","id":15570},{"urlkey":"japanese-martial-arts","name":"Japanese Martial Arts","id":18460},{"urlkey":"filipino-martial-arts","name":"Filipino Martial Arts","id":19466},{"urlkey":"combat","name":"Combat","id":21208},{"urlkey":"close-quarter-combat","name":"Close Quarter Combat","id":24042},{"urlkey":"stick-fighting","name":"Stick Fighting","id":24043},{"urlkey":"fencing-archery-and-medieval-martial-arts","name":"Fencing, Archery and Medieval Martial Arts","id":26753},{"urlkey":"internal-martial-arts","name":"Internal Martial Arts","id":28022},{"urlkey":"mma-mixed-martial-arts","name":"MMA Mixed Martial Arts","id":35023},{"urlkey":"chinese-martial-arts","name":"Chinese Martial Arts","id":38972},{"urlkey":"knife-defense","name":"Knife Defense","id":92715}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Martial-Arts-Dodgeball-Tennis-Paddle-Ball-VolleyBall\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>When the schedule says a start time it doesn't mean you have to be there at the specified start time. you can arrange to come at any point from start time to 8 pm.

There are so many issues affecting gay or same-gender loving (SGL) men as individuals, and many issues that come up when two (or more) gay\/SGL men come together to form a relationship. These include issues like coming out\/family acceptance; differences in values, priorities and habits; sex, monogamy and sexual or romantic openness; addiction and recovery; financial and life planning issues; health and aging. I have been in a relationship for 25 years and all of these issues have come up. Time and again, my partner and I have felt isolated in wrestling with these issues. I have also had many gay male friends in relationships who have brought these issues up with me in private (and mostly tortured) conversation. Aside from expensive couples counseling, there doesn't seem to be a forum or group for gay male couples partners to share their experiences, seek feedback, ideas and support and offer some in return. (With the group's collective approval, there may be opportunity for a therapist\/facilitator seasoned in the issues and experiences of gay men and couples to help guide the discussion.)<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/c\/e\/highres_432311982.jpeg","photo_id":432311982,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/c\/e\/600_432311982.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/c\/e\/thumb_432311982.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8999930,"name":"Angelo Ragaza"},"members":117,"name":"New York Gay Male Couples Support Meetup","id":18243198,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Gay-Male-Couples-Support-Meetup","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1418166868000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"publicspeaking","name":"Public Speaking","id":9300},{"urlkey":"storytelling","name":"Storytelling","id":9429},{"urlkey":"conversation","name":"Conversation","id":15099},{"urlkey":"creative-writing","name":"Creative Writing","id":15322},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"telling-your-story","name":"Telling Your Story","id":18029},{"urlkey":"writing-workshops","name":"Writing Workshops","id":18167},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"dating-again","name":"Dating Again","id":20814},{"urlkey":"non-fiction-writing","name":"Non-fiction writing","id":31732},{"urlkey":"short-story-writing","name":"Short Story Writing","id":35414},{"urlkey":"dating-advice","name":"Dating Advice","id":97613}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/shy-singles\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Introverted?

Being a member of a Narcissistic and Sociopath Support Group on FB, I decided survivors like myself and others need a place to meet up for fun times. as well as meet other singles.\u00a0 Even if you haven't been a person who's encountered narcissistic and sociopath people, you are more than welcome to join us.\u00a0 We are a group about having good times as well as find that special someone or make new friends in general.\u00a0 Please note that most of our meet up dining events will have a minimum amount of alcoholic beverages served.\u00a0 Reason being, it's to discourage the social media's project that people need an alcoholic beverage in order to have fun.\u00a0 Totally a misconception because naturally fun as well as easygoing people can do without artificial personality enhancements.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>So many of us are clueless on where to spend holidays. Well, this group is to eliminate being alone as well as start having fun times again with others in this group. As a member, you are welcome to suggest places for the group to explore such as live concert venues, self improvement workshops, beginner exercise classes, dining out, comedy clubs, crafting, any other fun social activities. I'm going to provide meetups that are fun as well as informative.\u00a0 Topics such as improving your appearance to compliment your best body features, recognizing sociopaths and narcissistic individuals, using food as medicine to maintain your overall health, and outdoor nature trail trips or a girls only meet up events.\u00a0 A meet up for guys only for girl code trivia.\u00a0 Yes ladies I plan to give the guys clues on knowing signs were not interested. lol!!\u00a0\u00a0<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>I don't object to meeting up in nearby States such as New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania.

Even of 2 or 3.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>I have a big place in Astoria. If you feel like me come over. We'll start off going around with some very good introductions and fun getting to know each other verbal games, I'll prepare. We'll get verbally intimate, as much as you'd like, and do it all in a very humanistic manner.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Then we'll learn about each others interests. Then we can go out for some food, watch marathon some Netflix, I have a WII U and some games, or do something else. Later on possibly read some interesting books together, go for a hike, or a weekend trips.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>I created this group because I've wasted far too much time of my life lounging around and I want to end this now.

At least to start anyway. We never start out at a bar, but we often end up at one; however, drinking is not a requirement. As a matter of fact, many of our members do not drink at all, but some do. <\/p> \n<p>Date Walks consist of men and women in a certain age range. We walk and talk while exploring nice outdoor locations such as waterfronts, parks, food festivals, art fairs and the like. Sometimes we do day stuff and sometimes we do night stuff and usually on the weekends. Every 6 or so minutes I ask the men to switch with a woman they have not spoken with until everyone has spoken with everyone. I usually take the group to a bar\/restaurant for further bonding. Date Walking really is the easiest way to meet someone special.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Some of my more popular and repeating Date Walks are:&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span>\u25ba Big Group Brooklyn Bridge Sunset Singles Walk <br>\u25ba Big Group Central Park Singles Stroll <br>\u25ba Big Group Singles 3-Bridge Walk <br>\u25ba Big Group Singles Roosevelt Island Walk <br>\u25ba Big Group Singles Stroll around Astoria <br>\u25ba Big Group Singles Sunset Walk on the High Line <br>\u25ba Big Group Date Walk for Dog Lovers &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you have any questions, comments, concerns or ideas, please do not hesitate to get in touch.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Thank you, <br> Beau, your Date Walking Organizer <br> &nbsp; <br> Call\/Text: 347-225-3516 <br> Email: datewalking@gmail.com<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/datewalking\">Date Walking<\/a> | <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/datewalking\">Facebook<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/datewalking\">Twitter<\/a>&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i> <br><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>I've tried Plenty of Fish, OKcupid, Coffee meets Bagel, Craigslist, Tinder and so on and it's the same thing every time: a little bit of back-and-forth communication that eventually diminishes to nothing. Either that or you actually meet a person here and a person there and there's no chemistry so it's over. More wasted time. I've been hosting walking events on Meetup groups for over 3 years and as far as I'm concerned, it's the best way to meet a woman because you're not just meeting 1 woman. It's like going on a date with 10 to 50 women at once and you get to walk and talk to them all. The only problem with regular walking groups is that you don't know who's single and who' isn't. With Date Walking you know.<\/i><\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/1\/1\/f\/highres_432804863.jpeg","photo_id":432804863,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/1\/1\/f\/600_432804863.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/1\/1\/f\/thumb_432804863.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":27685862,"name":"Beau"},"members":1615,"name":"Date Walking - The Easiest Way to Meet Someone Special","id":18268721,"state":"NY","urlname":"datewalking","category":{"name":"singles","id":30,"shortname":"singles"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Singles"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1419279254000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"marathon","name":"Marathon","id":401},{"urlkey":"running","name":"Running","id":2516},{"urlkey":"paris","name":"Paris","id":24767},{"urlkey":"americans-in-paris","name":"Americans in Paris","id":79688},{"urlkey":"running-beginning-train-for-a-marathon","name":"Running: Beginning Train for a Marathon","id":82464},{"urlkey":"running-training","name":"running training","id":99282},{"urlkey":"beginner-marathon-training","name":"Beginner Marathon Training","id":435542}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Marathon-Meetup-for-Paris-39th-2015-Marathon\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This group is for everyone who enjoys running, outdoor activity, traveling, meeting new people, and most importantly who's getting ready for Paris 2015 Marathon.<br>\n\n If you are planning to run Paris 2015 Marathon and want to meet others, who are planning to do the same, please join the group and let's get ready for this wonderful event together.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10786940,"name":"Kasey"},"members":13,"name":"New York Marathon Meetup for Paris 39th 2015 Marathon","id":18268818,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Marathon-Meetup-for-Paris-39th-2015-Marathon","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Paris Marathoners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1419279556000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"stress-relief","name":"Stress Relief","id":17075},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"breathing-exercises","name":"Breathing Exercises","id":19168},{"urlkey":"breathing-meditation","name":"Breathing Meditation","id":19570},{"urlkey":"transformation","name":"Transformation","id":21591},{"urlkey":"breathing-stretching","name":"Breathing & Stretching","id":42253},{"urlkey":"breathing","name":"Breathing","id":47627},{"urlkey":"conscious-breathing","name":"Conscious Breathing","id":60933},{"urlkey":"breathing-and-relaxation","name":"Breathing and Relaxation","id":105694},{"urlkey":"breathing-and-meditation","name":"Breathing and Meditation","id":130917}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Breathwork\/","rating":5,"description":"Brooklyn Breathwork is a monthly gathering that honors the sacred gift of life through the gentle and transformative modality of rebirthing breathwork. \n\nAll evenings are by donation with a suggested donation of $20 per person.

If you want to get involved in video production, and are an adult of sound mind and body this may be for you. We meet to voluntarily exchange media and production work. <br> <\/p>\n<p>The rules:<\/p>\n<p>RULE #1: You are not a participant, you are a reporter of the news, you do not place your self in danger, you do not place others in danger, you do not personally comment on situations or editorialize, you cover others at the event talking. They are the subject, not any of us in the meetup. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #2: If you want to make sure what you want get's published, either publish it your self on social media, or, convince someone in the group or outside of the group to publish. Just because you are part of the group, does not mean anyone has any obligation to contribute to your work. This is a loosely based meetup. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #3: Bring your skills. If you like being a reporter, if you want to do audio engineering, if you want to write music with true current social meaning, then this is an opportunity. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #4: Try to share your skills with others, there will always be video to produce, if you want to do video production, audio production, anything in the stream to create a news worthy news piece, this is your opportunity. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #5: Do this because you enjoy it, try to have fun, help others, try make meaning of the chaos. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #6: We attend public meeting using Open Meeting Law, in New Jersey this means you can only video speakers or officials, due to NJ draconian laws the public in a meeting has a 'right to privacy' at a meeting. In New York all present at meeting may be recorded.&nbsp; Recording can not interfere with an orderly meeting. NOTE: Every meeting will generate media to produce, I will generate it and provide it under Creative Commons, so if you are downstream of Video and Audio capture, don't worry, you will always have at least my work to work with. <br> <\/p>\n<p>I started this group when I found out that out of a city of 6+ million, there was no planned coverage of THE Post Ambrose LNG public hearing in Queens. It does not matter if you are a Conservative, Liberal, Progressive or any other affiliation. If you want to get involved with video production, this is an opportunity.

Our mission is to create more fun, freedom and fulfillment in the lives of EVERYONE. Admit it, you are either in dire need of fun or you love to have fun. What better way to exercise that fun bone than traveling the world with friends and family, meeting some fun and amazing people, and participating in fun filled excursions. Best part about it is that you decide what fun is for you. What does freedom mean to you? Freedom from mediocrity. Maybe you are time broke, always working and never have time with family. Maybe you have too much time and no money to do the things you love to do. Everyone could use a little extra money or a lot of extra money. One thing is for sure, we would all love more quality time with family and friends. You decide what you would like to be free from or free to do. Here's my favorite part of what we are centered around; fulfillment. What would make you feel fulfilled in life? What are your dreams and aspirations in life? What if you surrounded yourself around goal-oriented, ambitious and hard-working individuals, is it safe to say your lifestyle will change for the better? Better yet, is it safe to say you become who you surround yourself around? If after answering these questions you have even an ounce of curiosity or interest than you are who we are looking for.

Our purpose is simple: to be a place where single Jewish gay men can meet in fun, no-pressure, no non-sense environments so that they can find that special Jewish someone. For too long, too many Jewish gay men ended up dating non-Jewish men because (a) there aren't that many of out there to begin with; \u00a0and (b) with gay couples, starting a family and having a \"Jewish home,\" was not as much a priority as for a heterosexual couple.

For more info, please feel free to contact me here on Meetup!","lon":-74.0100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":136459282,"name":"Tiffany Michelle"},"members":172,"name":"Young Women's Wine and Book Club - Bergen County","id":18335291,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Young-Womens-Wine-and-Book-Club-Bergen-County","category":{"name":"literature\/writing","id":18,"shortname":"literature-writing"},"lat":40.8899993896,"who":"Readers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1421267968000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"robotics","name":"Robotics","id":682},{"urlkey":"architecture","name":"Architecture","id":1737},{"urlkey":"construction","name":"Construction","id":9401},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"urban-planning","name":"Urban Planning","id":18839},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"sustainable-development","name":"Sustainable Development","id":47570},{"urlkey":"smart-home","name":"Smart Home","id":73907},{"urlkey":"internet-of-things","name":"Internet of Things","id":79740},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"3d-printing","name":"3D Printing","id":114528},{"urlkey":"smart-cities","name":"Smart cities","id":205341},{"urlkey":"construction-robotics","name":"Construction Robotics","id":1504279}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Construction-Robotics-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"What will building be like in the future?

We are the Official Monster High Collectors Meet. This is primarily for Monster High, but any vinyl fashion doll enthusiasts are welcome. I myself collect Jem and Monster High. I am also a doll customizer and will be giving short tutorials on how to do some aspects of that. Sewing, hair rerooting, painting, etc. Dont worry about Skill level. My tutorials are easy to follow FEBRUARY 15th, we will be making basic clothes (dresses) by hand, supplies supplied by me. Our address is 590 Madison Ave, in the public atrium of the IBM building in Manhattan. Very easy to find. We meet at noon sharp, and sometimes go to dinner after.","lon":-73.9300003052,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/1\/c\/highres_435268700.jpeg","photo_id":435268700,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/1\/c\/600_435268700.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/1\/c\/thumb_435268700.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","members":22,"name":"Official New York Fashion Doll Collectors Meet.","id":18350337,"state":"NY","urlname":"Official-New-York-Monster-High-Collectors-Meet","category":{"name":"fashion\/beauty","id":8,"shortname":"fashion-beauty"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Dollie-hollics"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Bayonne","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1421618416000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"toastmasters","name":"Toastmasters","id":3307},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"publicspeaking","name":"Public Speaking","id":9300},{"urlkey":"leadership","name":"Leadership","id":15121},{"urlkey":"presentations","name":"Presentations","id":16223},{"urlkey":"communication","name":"Communication","id":16225},{"urlkey":"personal-development","name":"Personal Development","id":16468},{"urlkey":"communication-skills","name":"Communication Skills","id":20923},{"urlkey":"fear-of-public-speaking","name":"Fear of Public Speaking","id":42862},{"urlkey":"impromptu-speaking","name":"Impromptu Speaking","id":115794},{"urlkey":"the-art-of-public-speaking","name":"The Art of Public Speaking","id":154207},{"urlkey":"toastmasters-is-the-proven-way-to-public-speaking","name":"toastmasters is the proven way to public speaking","id":1287972}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hudson-Toastmasters-Club-Bayonne\/","rating":5,"description":"Toastmasters is a world-reknowned organization that helps people develop themselves to their fullest potential.

The goal is to make new friends, enjoy delicious food, and learn about different cultures. If you have a particular cuisine or restaurant you would like to try, feel free to let us know. We are always looking for cultural ambassadors who can show us their foods.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>DETAILS: We will have both small and large group dinners.&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<span>Small group (4-6 people)&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>\u2022&nbsp;<\/span><span>Large group (6-12 people)&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><b>In addition to dinners, to keep things interesting, we will host other events:&nbsp;<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<span>Coffee\/Tea Meetups<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Food Crawls (sampling of food&nbsp;from different restaurants that are within walking distance)&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>\u2022&nbsp;Happy Hours\/Bar Meetups&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<span>Karaoke&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>\u2022&nbsp;Sports&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<span>Picnics&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>\u2022&nbsp;Comedy Clubs&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<span>Shows&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>\u2022&nbsp;Game Night<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><b>RULES:&nbsp;<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p>1) FEES: We don\u2019t believe in charging people to make friends. However, we also know that inconsiderate RSVPs spoil the experience for everyone. For most events we will charge a $1 maintenance fee, this is not to make money. &nbsp;The money goes toward the group and covers the monthly website fee. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2) ATTENDANCE: Most events will be first come first serve. If you RSVP and cannot go, please provide notice a day in advance. Of course, we understand there are emergencies, but please do let us know.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3) RSVP policy: If you RSVP and cancel the day before the meetup, please send the organizer(s) a message to notify them. If you fail to do so or RSVP and do not show up, you will be temporarily suspended from the next meetup. If you RSVP and do not show up on occasion depending on the circumstances you may be either suspended from the group for a longer period of time, or removed from the group. Though this may sound harsh, please understand that the organizers put time and effort into planning these meetups. More importantly, this gives others a chance to attend our events.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4) Profile pictures: Please have a clear photo of yourself when you join. We know you're not actually the NY skyline or a cartoon character. &nbsp;:)<\/p>\n<p><span>Thank you and we look forward to meeting you all!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/6\/6\/d\/highres_433478509.jpeg","photo_id":433478509,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/6\/6\/d\/600_433478509.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/6\/6\/d\/thumb_433478509.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":137324982,"name":"Michael"},"members":392,"name":"NYC Young Food Lovers","id":18351068,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYCYoungFoodLovers","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Awesome People"}],"meta":{"next":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/2\/groups?country=us&offset=11&city=New+York&format=json&lon=-73.9899978638&access_token=fb12b23d5bc76742d4fbb5fc460c8141&state=ny&page=800&radius=25.0&fields=&lat=40.75&order=id&status=past&desc=false","method":"Groups","total_count":12055,"link":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/2\/groups","count":800,"description":"","lon":-73.9899978638,"title":"Meetup Groups v2","url":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/2\/groups?country=us&offset=10&city=New+York&format=json&lon=-73.9899978638&access_token=fb12b23d5bc76742d4fbb5fc460c8141&state=ny&page=800&radius=25.0&fields=&lat=40.75&order=id&status=past&desc=false","id":"","updated":1441165782000,"lat":40.75}}
