Do you enjoy meeting new people, and making new friends? Do you love making a difference? If this sounds like you, then you have come to the right place!<\/p>\n<p>This group is for young professional women, in their 20-30's, who are confident, fun, and love being a woman (and all its perks! ;) ). You can be single or coupled, new to NY or born and raised here, but ultimately a chic chick that loves to have a good time!<\/p>\n<p>What I want this group to be about are three things:<\/p>\n<p>1. Going to great events, such as beautiful lounges\/clubs, red carpet screenings, launch events, cocktail receptions\/opening nights, cultural events, or any other event where we can See or Be Seen, mix, mingle, and network with those in all different industries. Basically, any occasion to get dolled up, and put on a cute outfit!<\/p>\n<p>2. Establishing great friendships. I figure if we are like minded, totally normal females, we shouldn't have any trouble making some great connections. We can do that by doing brunch, happy hours, spa days, and anything else we feel like. This is our group, we can do what we want!<\/p>\n<p>3. Getting involved in making a difference. I have this dying need to get involved in the community, raise money for charities, and just help out those in need. I would love to plan events for a specific cause, or work with other organizations to reach a goal. And ideally, maybe even start a NPO. The possibilities are endless!<\/p>\n<p>If this is what you are looking for, I would absolutely love it if you joined this group.

And why not learn about photography in great locations, experiencing international culture, beauty, food, wine and so much more.

The goal is to visit beautiful and interesting destinations, especially the places that tourists do not normally get to see.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you love to travel solo, as a couple or in a group of friends, you are welcome to join us. Our trips will even be great if you travel with someone that is not necessarily into photography.

Everyone on meetup is looking for something :)<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>*Most meetups will be in Manhattan and every so often Brooklyn and possibly queens.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/4\/c\/highres_19606668.jpeg","photo_id":19606668,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/4\/c\/600_19606668.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/4\/c\/thumb_19606668.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":12037545,"name":"Sarah"},"members":71,"name":"Genuine girlfriends of Manhattan & Brooklyn  20's early 30's","id":1737599,"state":"NY","urlname":"Genuinegirlfriends20s","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Divas who care"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Stamford","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1289809868000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"webstandards","name":"Web Standards","id":417},{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"webdesign","name":"Web Design","id":659},{"urlkey":"css","name":"CSS","id":1973},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript","id":7029},{"urlkey":"ria","name":"Rich Internet Applications","id":9886},{"urlkey":"ixd","name":"Interaction Design","id":10110},{"urlkey":"technology","name":"Technology","id":10579},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"user-experience","name":"User Experience","id":19243},{"urlkey":"ruby-on-rails","name":"Ruby On Rails","id":20837},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"html5","name":"HTML5","id":78565},{"urlkey":"javascript-frameworks","name":"JavaScript Frameworks","id":85951}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/stamfordio\/","rating":4.71,"description":"<p>We're a fun loving, pizza eating, group of programming beginners and experts committed to the development and learning of&nbsp;<span>web, mobile and backend software development.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We come from all different professions and occupations to share our knowledge of development and learn from one another.

MoT is an athletic fund raising initiative for reforestation and tree nursery projects (in Haiti and beyond).<\/p>\n<p>In the three years since Miles of Trees was launched, we have steadily grown, heavily pedaled, and significantly celebrated the rush and adrenaline that comes with physical exercise and the outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>Now, we want to take the next step and really open up Miles of Trees to everyone, novice or expert rider. Previous MoT riders, current team members, and members of the MoT Organizing Committee will be using this group to post fun, training and practice rides.<\/p>\n<p>These rides will vary in length, in time, and in difficulty. There will be rides for all of you.

Classes are held once a week on a variety of topics such as anger, deepening relationships, developing contentment, and developing a meditation practice. Although the classes are based on the teachings of Buddhism, you don\u2019t have to be Buddhist to benefit from the teachings.<\/p>\n<p>Classes are offered through the Dharmachakra Buddhist Center, which is a Buddhist meditation center in northern New Jersey that is now offering classes in the Ridgewood area. We offer instruction in meditation and Buddhist spiritual practice. We envision a world based upon compassion and inner peace, where anyone who wishes can travel the path to enlightenment. We are building this world one mind at a time.<\/p>\n<p>Meditation is for everyone, from those who seek relaxation to those who wish to follow the Buddhist spiritual path. Buddhist teachings are for everyone, regardless of spiritual background, and you do not need to be Buddhist to benefit from them. Buddhism is not evangelical. Buddhist teachings are intended as practical advice to solve inner problems and benefit others.<\/p>\n<p>We are dedicated to helping you find happiness from within your own heart and real solutions to your problems through Buddha\u2019s advice. We provide instruction in Buddhist meditation and we promote the teachings and ideals of Kadampa Buddhism in New Jersey.<\/p>\n<p>The New Kadampa Tradition is a lineage of Buddhism that is practiced worldwide and is independent of any Asian culture. This lineage was first introduced to the West in 1976 and since then has spread to more than 36 countries and 600 centers worldwide. This lineage originated in India and Tibet, and is presented in contemporary form by the life and works of Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso.<\/p>\n<p>As a not-for-profit organization, Dharmachakra Buddhist Center (DBC) relies on the generosity of our students and friends to make our programming possible. Along with fees generated by classes held at DBC and satellite locations, we depend on contributions to meet our expenses.

Please go to our team's blog page <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jkorunning.blogspot.com\">http:\/\/www.jkorunning.blogspot.com<\/a> and click on the <strong>\"Buy Now\"<\/strong> button. There is a .45 cent processing charge for each payment. You can download our <a href=\"http:\/\/jkorunning.blogspot.com\/p\/membership-information.html\">team's application<\/a> from there, then fax it back to (888) 397-7256.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\"><span style=\"color : #f38897 ; font-size : small\">Our team meets every Thursday and Saturday and the first Monday of every month. Additional runs &amp; walks may be scheduled during the Spring to Fall Seasons. You can see a schedule of race events members will be participating in on our team blog as well.<br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\"><span style=\"color : #f38897 ; font-size : small\"><span style=\"color : #00ccff\">For our group runs all members are required to complete a stretch together. Our team is about TEAM!! This means that the pace will be that of the slowest runner to start before the logistics of breaking up is determined. We leave no woman left behind ever! This means if a pair of fast runners are with a slower one you will have to circle back to see how she is doing, run a bit with her, keep the level of motivation up, run and circle back. By doing this you help foster a healthy team environment and still get your running time and distance in. Have a positive domino effect! Anyone who runs off during any group run and leaves a sole sister behind will be removed from the group.<\/span><br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\"><strong><span style=\"color : #f38897 ; font-size : small\">Please do not join this group if you are looking for just another running group to add to your runner's black book. In the end a team of 20 who are active, engaged and supportive of each other is better than a thousand ghost runners.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\"><span style=\"color : #f38897 ; font-size : small\"><span style=\"color : #00ccff\">You do not have to be on meetup.com to join.

I volunteer to help people get involved in real estate. Granted, I am not a millionaire or a \u201cqualified\u201d mentor like those late-night infomercials would have you believe. I am not here to sell you books, or tapes. I am not here to charge any money for seminars or junk like that. I am here to evaluate your purchases, advise on repair work and create a proper team around your so that they can invest properly and with as little risk as possible. The second reason is that I am looking for partners on my personal deals. I am not looking to solicit anyone, but I am coming across stuff that is really great and I need capital to make things happen. In return, I offer training, guidance and returns Wall Steet can only dream of\u2026or at least lie about (see movie \u201cInside Job\u201d for details). My books are transparent and so am I. We can review mine and\/or anyone else\u2019s deals, past successes and\/or failures. I believe in this as a long term goal and would be happy to help you make Main Street a reality for you!<\/p>\n<p>MY goal.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of this network is simple. It is to grow and invest wisely in long term assets that provide a positive return month after month. This game should no longer be for the big boys, everyone should have a chance to invest and live easier. I am simply trying to organize a new group of people, future partners, and investment entrepreneurs who can improve their lives and provide for themselves in the future. Because we both know, neither the government nor Wall Street will do that for you. I am convinced of this now.<br>\n\n Join if you like, but remember: This is for serious investors ONLY. We will be analyzing deals constantly. We will be visiting prospective purchases and locations. Our Meetups will be in different parts of NY\/NJ\/PA, they will not be in a conference room most of the time. We need to touch and be hand\u2019s on because the classroom is no longer a good learning venue. We will be hunting, acquiring and growing our wealth together. So if you aren\u2019t serious about committing yourself here, do NOT join or waste our time. Thank you and looking forward to meeting everyone for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Thank You,<\/p>\n<p>Val Kleyman<\/p>\n<p>Val.Kleyman83@gmail.com<\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/8\/highres_392282232.jpeg","photo_id":392282232,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/8\/600_392282232.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/8\/thumb_392282232.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":13610010,"name":"Val Kleyman"},"members":103,"name":"REAL Estate Investing for THE AVERAGE JOE!","id":1752830,"state":"NY","urlname":"Private-Partners-RE-Investors","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Private Partners & RE Investors"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1292892608000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"blackbiz","name":"Black Professionals","id":2494},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"speed-dating","name":"Speed Dating","id":15233},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"black-singles","name":"Black Singles","id":17053},{"urlkey":"life-coaching","name":"Life Coaching","id":18692},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Network-NYC\/","rating":4.6,"description":"<p>The purpose of this group is to provide a venue for professionals in the Black community to socialize, network, build relationships and connections.

We created online maps from satelllite images, put SMS and media reports onto an Ushahidi map, got documents into Sahana, added the details of people who were lost into Google's People Finder tool, built websites and software to help, and did dozens of other small data jobs that made a difference to what was available online and in the country (we even sent data updates into the country on USB sticks). Since then, we've mapped in places like Libya (refugees), Japan (tsunami), Chile (earthquake), Pakistan (floods), Somalia (refugees), Alabama (tornadoes) and been ready to help with dozens of other crises around the world.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Crisismappers are usually volunteers: many of them are highly-skilled both at data gathering, mapping and analysis, and in areas which impact this work (like open-source technologies), but if you're new to crisismapping, don't let that put you off joining in: everyone starts as a newbie sometime, and many of those skills were gained through hours of working on maps.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><strong>What's this crisismapping meetup about?<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n This meetup is open to anyone working on crisismapping, working with crisismappers or interested in crisismapping in general.

If you are reading this, we know one one thing for sure - we have something in common. Let's explore...<\/p>\n<p><strong>Doesn't matter if you happen to be<\/strong> an entrepreneur, manager, recent graduate, attorney, physician, fashion rebel, CFA, CPA, MBA, yoga teacher, a monk or whatever as long as you have the fire in you to make a difference to the community around you. The power of this group will be behind you. Read further to find out...<\/p>\n<p><strong>This group is designed to operate at the intersection of traditional universities and the real world<\/strong>. Why? Have you not noticed a large gap yet? Has such gaps been fixed in decades? You know it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why entrepreneurship?<\/strong> Because it creates freedom. Yes, even an employee who has an entrepreneurial mindset is more valuable to the firm (with good leadership &amp; management).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why freedom?<\/strong> How else will you attain the peace-of-mind? If you don't have it, can you give it to others? Someone had answered with a yes and stated the rationale \"easier to achieve collectively in a team with competent people around\" (no, this group is nothing about MLM if you are thinking about that.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why do founders of this group care about this strange topic?<\/strong> Well, the answer is the same as why Columbus cared about exploring the Americas. The answer is - we don't know. We are just passionate about this.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Our experience in leading a group like this?<\/strong> You will have to have millions of dollars if you want to have the leaders of this forum on your payroll. But, we are free. We bring top quality education, degrees, certificates, work experience, and entrepreneurial commitments. Our intention is to de-monopolize and disrupt the traditional chain and restore the collective freedom.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Enough of philosophy?<\/strong> Okay, so let's transition beyond this. This group is all about \"practical\" skills in areas that matter to nearly all individuals regardless of the chosen profession. Strong skills give you confidence. Confidence drives results with minimum efforts. That in turn frees us from many self-made personal and financial traps.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So, what kind of skills?<\/strong> Well, think about it. Either you are making money for yourself directly or doing so indirectly by working for someone else. Regardless, the key challenge remains the same. Are your skills up-to-date to sustain your aspirations? If not, are you leveraging your soft-skills a little too much based on your fear!? Well, that fear will only get multiplied further. A better solution might be to address the root cause - update your hard skills.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What hard\/semi-hard skills are we talking about here?<\/strong> All those practical skills that matter to entrepreneurs, mid-career managers, and young professionals. Below are some examples:<\/p>\n<p>** Formulating Strategy (vision, ideas &amp; concepts, sector coverage, kickstarting, business plans, etc.) <br> ** Implementing Strategy (program management, partnerships, etc.) <br> ** Building Financial Plan (funding, cash flows, P&amp;L, investment, global coverage, etc.) <br> ** Developing Marketing Strategy (differentiation, pricing, promotions, channels, etc.) <br> ** Designing Operational Model (process, roles, responsibilities, etc.) <br> ** Leveraging Information Technology (strategic architecture, security, etc.)<\/p>\n<p>** Managing Talent &amp; Human Resources (empowerment, training, etc.)<\/p>\n<p>** Learning Negotiation Skills (preparation, conducting, interfacing with parties, etc.)<\/p>\n<p>** Delivering Business Presentations (structure of thoughts, leadership presence, etc.)<\/p>\n<p>** Most importantly, enhancing confidence!<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do we know these skills are critical?<\/strong> We created focused \"temporary\" groups for these and listened to the market first-hand! You can check them out while they exist - ask for the links!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Did you know?<\/strong> This new forum as well as the earlier \"temporary\" ones have been masterminded by our leadership team to kick off the next age of \"intellectual\" revolution!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Interested?<\/strong> This is your chance to be a part of a history in making by joining, taking advantage of the free workshops filled with practical hands-on skills, and contributing in creative ways to this member-led forum!<\/p>\n<p><strong>EMD Leadership Team<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>************History: About Us!**********<\/p>\n<p><span>P.S.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. After living in a monastic setting for eight years, Atma resumed his undergraduate education at Brown University, where he hosted weekly programs that focused on kirtan and Bhagavad Gita. &nbsp;He then enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School from which he graduated in 2004 and from which he received a merit scholarship for 75% of tuition. &nbsp;Currently, Atma spends his weekdays as a securities fraud federal prosecutor. &nbsp;His primary goal is to imbibe in his own life the devotional teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and to share the same with others as a humble offering to God.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Subhie has been living her life according to the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita since 1991 and is also an initiated priest. &nbsp;Subhie lived in a monastic setting until 2005. &nbsp; From 1991 to 2005, Subhie taught Bhagavad Gita in Croatia, Serbia, Greece, Germany, and United Kingdom. &nbsp;Subhie spent several years studying Vedic knowledge in India, primarily in the holy town, Vrindavana. &nbsp;After 2005, Subhie resumed her undergraduate education in religion at the University of London -- and then locally at Queens College, after she moved to New York and married Atma. &nbsp;Subhie also got her Master's degree in teaching at Queens College. &nbsp;She is currently an elementary school teacher.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/9\/1\/highres_48722961.jpeg","photo_id":48722961,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/9\/1\/600_48722961.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/9\/1\/thumb_48722961.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13758142,"name":"Atma & Subhie"},"members":271,"name":"Kirtan Yoga & Bhagavad Gita As It Is Discourses -- NYC","id":1764957,"state":"NY","urlname":"Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Montclair","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1294903622000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"international-travel","name":"International Travel","id":16179},{"urlkey":"weekend-adventures","name":"Weekend Adventures","id":16438},{"urlkey":"culture","name":"Culture","id":20169},{"urlkey":"day-trips","name":"Day Trips","id":20423},{"urlkey":"women-who-travel","name":"Women Who Travel","id":23496},{"urlkey":"weekend-getaways","name":"Weekend Getaways","id":28784},{"urlkey":"women-solo-travel","name":"Women Solo Travel","id":30913},{"urlkey":"solo-travel","name":"Solo Travel","id":30915},{"urlkey":"mens-solo-travel","name":"Men's Solo Travel","id":49243},{"urlkey":"travel-for-men-and-women","name":"Travel for Men and Women","id":102440},{"urlkey":"learning-about-world-travel","name":"Learning about World Travel","id":122266}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Northern-New-Jersey-World-Travellers-Over-30-Meetup-Group\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This group is for people who enjoy travelling and would like to exchange travel information, tips, stories and learn about different places in the world.

All share a need for quality of life, economic adaptation, and if necessary survive a catastrophic local or global event.  <br \/>New and wanting to learn how to get started or someone with experience, this group may have the missing pieces you are still searching to find.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>&ldquo;IT&rdquo; could happen? <br \/>Many &ldquo;IT&rdquo; events HAVE happened some place in the world within the last 10 years and can happen again: Spree killings, Terrorist Attacks (Massive arson, Dirty bombs, chemical attacks, biological attacks, cyber-attacks, EMP attacks), Natural Disasters (pandemics, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, Massive forest fires, floods, mud-slides, famine, Solar storm EMP), Industrial accidents (Nuclear accidents, electrical grid collapse, chemical accidents), Economic collapse and &ldquo;Unknown X Factors.&rdquo; Turn your fear into action and feel secure because of your own efforts of self-preparedness.<\/p>\r\n<p>No SANE person wants \"IT\" to happen<\/p>\r\n<p>I LIVE in A CITY! <br \/>When someone gets serious about the survival of loved ones and themselves, they start looking for answers. You like me may have found that 98% of the books and websites are focused on what I call &ldquo;Wild World Survival.&rdquo; Bush craft and wilderness survival define &ldquo;Wild World Survival.&rdquo; The killer APP for &ldquo;Wild World Survival&rdquo; is found in fire making. Are you tried of how to survive after being lost in woods information?<\/p>\r\n<p>I live in the city and want to survive in my city. This group is for city apartment dwellers to suburban homeowners who want to turn their space into a LIFEPOD. The &ldquo;Prepping In The City&rdquo; Meetup group is Not about &ldquo;Bush craft&rdquo; or &ldquo;wilderness survival.&rdquo; This group is about the realities of surviving and thriving around glass, steel and concrete. Survival in the big city is about planning, design and construction. It takes careful design based planning, science and engineering.<\/p>\r\n<p>Do you refuse to live life no farther back than the 1900s? This MeetUp group will focus on how to live well in the world NOW and survive any future event to live well again. Our goal is to provide knowledge for both individuals and groups to survive and thrive before, during and after a major disaster or civil breakdown. How to effectively take action independent of waiting for private or government organizations to come to the rescue.  People can die from waiting. This knowledge is deployed in urban environments preparation-projects far in advance of  &ldquo;IT&rdquo; events.<\/p>\r\n<p>Meetups will consist of both learning clinics and in depth workshops. Learning formats are fee based. During clinics and workshops, both &ldquo;basic level preps&rdquo; and &ldquo;hardcore level preps&rdquo; will be discussed and demonstrated.<\/p>\r\n<p>Basic Level-if you are on a tight budget and want the most economical answers. You just want to be prepared without having to make a larger commitment of space to gear.<\/p>\r\n<p>Hardcore Level- is for the extreme obsessive person who wants to cover all possible scenarios and may just be a major gear head at heart anyway.<\/p>\r\n<p>Both levels come with explanations of what to do with each tool in each type of situation. <br \/>What good are tools if you have no clue how they can help you stay alive.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Prepping in the city&rdquo; Meetup Group will also function as a &ldquo;Preppers Wingman club,&rdquo; the place where you can find prepping partners. The group is a resource to build and complete your &ldquo;IT&rdquo; event survival team.<\/p>\r\n<p>Will also take many deep dives into the cognitive Science of Survival. How split second decisions you make in an &ldquo;IT&rdquo; event can spell the difference between life and death.<\/p>\r\n<p>All Humans are welcome <br \/>The group is a non-political, non-paramilitary group, non-religious group. You will discover a group for the Thinkers, doers, and creators who live in the urban and suburban world.<\/p>\r\n<p>Contact: PreppingInTheCity@gmail.com<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Copyright 2011 All Rights Reserved Neopotentials and \"Prepping IN The City\"<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/3\/a\/highres_21445146.jpeg","photo_id":21445146,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/3\/a\/600_21445146.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/3\/a\/thumb_21445146.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":4792086,"name":"Merlin"},"members":84,"name":"PREPPING IN THE CITY","id":1765528,"state":"NY","urlname":"PREPPING-IN-THE-CITY","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Greenwich","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1295027329000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"ethics","name":"Ethics","id":1768},{"urlkey":"leadership","name":"Leadership","id":15121},{"urlkey":"faith","name":"Faith","id":25051},{"urlkey":"ceo-network","name":"CEO network","id":54397},{"urlkey":"faith-in-the-workplace","name":"Faith in the Workplace","id":149194}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greenwich-Leadership-Forum\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>The Greenwich Leadership Forum* (&ldquo;GLF&rdquo;) is an organization that provides a forum for business executives to explore how faith and religious principles can play an important role in their decision-making, while building and leading successful and ethically sound organizations.

Hoboken Moms strives to build long lasting relationships between moms and children that extend past our meet ups.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you have free time please consider volunteering to host a playgroup.

This group offers simple down-to-earth guided meditations designed to connect with deeper parts of oneself and one&rsquo;s own experience of the sacred.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>We use the book &ldquo;Silo&rsquo;s Message&rdquo; to guide our meetings. Silo is a spiritual guide who is also well-known for developing Universalist Humanism.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>Our purpose is to create an environment that will nurture and foster deep experiences and help us notice them and live them in our daily life.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>Our meetings are small and community oriented so that everyone can interact easily and comfortably. And they are always open &ndash; no commitment or experience is required. Complete beginners are welcome.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>Each meeting is divided into two parts: the first is dedicated to discussion and interchange from Silo's Message and the second part to internal experience. We work with guided experiences that focus on Well-Being for ourselves and others and an experience which is focused on quieting the mind and awakening the internal energy, known as the Force.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>This is not a religious organization and we welcome and respect people of all backgrounds and beliefs. We work entirely on a volunteer basis. There are no costs for the meeting.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>Occasionally we have day long seminars at the Hudson Valley Park of Study and Reflection (see our sister meetup group http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Spirituality-Nature-Meetup-Day-trips-out-of-NYC\/). The Park is a beautiful retreat center located 2 hours from New York City which is part of the world-wide network of parks inspired by Silo&rsquo;s work. http:\/\/www.hudsonvalleypark.org\/\n<br \/>\n<br \/>For information about Silo and his life:\n<br \/>\n<br \/>Biography: http:\/\/silosmessage.net\/about_silo.asp?LANG=EN\n<br \/>\n<br \/>Description of Silo&rsquo;s life work: http:\/\/newhumanist.us\/?p=1211<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/3\/b\/a\/highres_23038298.jpeg","photo_id":23038298,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/3\/b\/a\/600_23038298.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/3\/b\/a\/thumb_23038298.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13481406,"name":"Nicole Myers"},"members":322,"name":"New York Meditation group Union Square based on The Message","id":1783897,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Meditation-group-Union-Square-based-on-The-Message","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Chatham","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1297758799000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"attachmentparenting","name":"Attachment Parenting","id":1621},{"urlkey":"mothersrights","name":"Mothers' Rights","id":9988},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"workingmoms","name":"Working Moms","id":10555},{"urlkey":"breastfeeding","name":"Breastfeeding","id":15534},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"new-moms","name":"New Moms","id":16208},{"urlkey":"baby-wearing","name":"Babywearing","id":17535},{"urlkey":"natural-parenting","name":"Natural Parenting","id":23428},{"urlkey":"postpartum-depression","name":"Postpartum Depression","id":38322},{"urlkey":"expecting-moms","name":"Expecting Moms","id":47157},{"urlkey":"being-present-with-your-baby","name":"Being \"present\" with your baby","id":156148},{"urlkey":"letting-go-of-control-and-perfectionism","name":"Letting go of control and perfectionism","id":156149}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/the-mothers-club\/","rating":4.79,"description":"<p>Our moms groups are legendary!

We explore the notion of 'Emotional Freedom' and introduce ideas about healing, mindfulness, and spirituality that can help us live more fulfilling lives.<\/p>\n<p>The essential question is, \"what does the idea of emotional freedom mean to you?\"<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEmotional Overwhelm\u201d can prevent us from effectively meeting challenges, accepting change and moving ahead. Thoughts about difficult situations and past events can trigger negative emotions that keep us stuck. EMOTIONAL FREEDOM TECHNIQUES (EFT), which is based on the emerging field of Energy Psychology, can quickly and effectively address any kind of negative emotion that keeps you from enjoying a greater life experience. In EFT, you learn to tap on specific body trigger points to correct the energy disruptions that cause unwanted emotions (like using psychological acupuncture). Come learn this easy and effective approach to self healing and together we\u2019ll tap our way to more emotional freedom and well being.<\/p>\n<p>The facilitator for these meetings is Steven Gottlieb, a personal performance and empowerment coach and a specialist in the emerging fields of Energy Psychology and Energy Medicine. He conducts workshops and personal consultations that have helped hundreds of people to overcome obstacles to experiencing a healthier and more joyful life. He passionately shares his knowledge of cutting edge healing techniques and offers these from a heart centered approach.

So effective 2006 I changed it to Pooky's All Breed Dog Walking Club!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>All breeds &amp; ages are welcome! The club has grown by leaps &amp; bounds! &nbsp;We meet at various local parks in northern NJ when the weather is nice. We <strong>Walk<\/strong>, <strong>Hike<\/strong>, hold <strong>Yappy Hours<\/strong>, go to the <strong>Beach<\/strong>, have <strong>Ice Cream Socials<\/strong>, <strong>Birthday Parties<\/strong>, go on <strong>Field trips<\/strong> &amp; much more!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Your dog should be friendly with other dogs however reactive dogs are welcome. If your dog is reactive, you are&nbsp;<em>encouraged<\/em> to come &amp; I will help you work through it. Plus the dogs go home tired! A tired dog is a good dog. Hey we all can use a little exercise! This is a leashed all breed exercise &amp; socialization walk for dogs &amp; their humans. Get Fit with Fido!&nbsp;We've met some great people, some great dogs &amp; made new friends!&nbsp;Your dog should be leashed &amp;&nbsp;up to date on shots. Please bring&nbsp;water &amp; poop bags. Training tips are also offered.

It was founded in 1985 by investor Victor Niederhoffer, who hosts each meeting. More info on the NYC is available at NYCJunto.org. More info on Niederhoffer is available at his website <a href=\"http:\/\/www.DailySpeculations.com\">DailySpeculations<\/a>. Niederhoffer tweets at&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VicNiederhoffer\">twitter.com\/VicNiederhoffer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The NYC Junto is inspired by the Junto hosted by Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia from 1727 to 1757. Like Franklin, we bring together intelligent people to discuss intellectual issues in a respectful manner.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Our meetings are always held at the Mechanics Institute at at 20 W 44th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues&nbsp;in Manhattan on the first Thursday of each month.<\/strong> We usually have a guest speaker who can bring new insights and ideas to us. Debate and questions are encouraged. Admission is free. No donation is requested. There is no connection with any political party or religious organization.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why I started the group:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I read in Benjamin Franklin's autobiography that the most valuable thing he ever did in his life was to have a series of meetings with a dozen of his friends where they would try to make contributions to natural philosophy as well as their individual welfare.<\/p>\n<p>I always had tremendous respect for Doug Casey of the Eris group and I tried to model a group halfway between the Eris Society and the kind of group that Benjamin Franklin had. I invited people interested in free markets and the idea was to have one paper from the point of view of liberty to give us something hard to bite into and then discuss it and have a lot of feedback. And it has spontaneously grown.<\/p>\n<p>We have it once a month, almost always on the first Thursday. It used to be at my office in New York until they chased me out of New York with their excessive taxation.<\/p>\n<p>We started out by trying a few different formats but we coalesced on a format that works. We have about an hour where members unload various things about liberty in the news that they have a particular insight into. Then we have an invited speaker who talks about his own work on the forefront of individualism or liberty, and then we have a very animated discussion and feedback.<\/p>\n<p>In our group, we have experts on almost every subject. The speakers always tell us that it's one of the most dynamic experiences for them. People write to me from all over the U.S. that they love my Junto, that it is one of the highlights of their life, that they hate to move out of New York, and that they will never be able to find anything like it.<\/p>\n<p>I finance it and pay for the speakers.<\/p>\n<p>Almost every major free market and individualist speaker has spoken at our group, and it has been going for almost 30 years.<\/p>\n<p>All are welcome.<\/p>\n<p>Victor Niederhoffer<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/d\/0\/b\/highres_435168395.jpeg","photo_id":435168395,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/d\/0\/b\/600_435168395.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/d\/0\/b\/thumb_435168395.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14143271,"name":"Victor Niederhoffer"},"members":287,"name":"NYC Junto","id":1791553,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYCJunto","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"members of NYC Junto"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Jersey City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1299007736000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"stress-relief","name":"Stress Relief","id":17075},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"transformation","name":"Transformation","id":21591},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/be-happy-JC\/","rating":4.72,"description":"<p>Come home to the \"Art of Living\" Jersey City Happiness Group!\u00a0We are\u00a0dedicated to empowering you to live life to it's fullest potential through Breathing, Meditation &amp; Knowledge. \u00a0Come learn simple, yet profound ways to live a peaceful, happy, and healthy life.

You can choose to do as many or as few activities as you like.<br>\n\nI plan local camping trips that are within 1-2 hours of New Rochelle\/Bronx area and as I spend alot of time researching for the lowest cost campgrounds and\/or getting us discount group rates you will be able to save money! And I make sure that there are activities in the area! Note, although I appreciate that everyone has their favorite sites camp grounds...it is next to impossible to get more than two people to sign up for a campground that is more than 1 and 1\/2 hours away from New Rochelle New York...so I almost never post any that are further than that driving range.<br>\n\nIf you bring an item YOU should be able to assemble and disassemble anything you bring with NO help! \u2013if you can\u2019t please be considerate and CALL me WAY in advance and lets practice together for the ease of everyone\u2014camping should be easy and relaxing NOT WORK! If you aren\u2019t sitting down within 30 minutes of arrival you have forgotten the most important camping information: LESS IS MORE\u2026You will enjoy the experience MORE if you have LESS!<br>\n\nAll New Members are required to post an actual current picture of themselves, which is clearly identifiable for safety reasons. A picture that is far away, your face is hidden by a tree, helmet etc will not be accepted. You will not be accepted to the group with a picture that I can't recognize you when you walk into camp...and if your picture changes before I know you really well then you will be removed from group for the safety of all members.<br>\n\nAll members must have a current paypal account, I do not accept cash payments, as I do not want cash at the site, and frankly once I get to the site I am there to relax not deal with who has paid and who hasn't. You must pay the nominal fee to sign up for an event. It unfortunately costs money to keep this site up and running and as I do not charge members monthly or annual membership fees...I have to charge a bit to off set the cost of keeping our site up so we get to keep our pictures and a way to stay in touch..please do note that I do my best to keep costs down!<br>\n\nIt is the members responsibility to READ the write up about each camping trip and to book their own site and bring all their own food and beverage! Occasionally we get group sites which is clearly listed in the write up...so be sure to read...if you ask a question that is already in the write up...I will just tell you to \"refer to the write up!\" lol please it is a lot of work so save me some energy and time and just take your time to read the write up about each event.<br>\n\n.. everyone can do all their cooking at the base camping site that I will always post the number so we can spend time together and enjoy each others company. That does not mean we cook for you or supply food...you have to bring stoves, pots dishes etc...<br>\n\nNote that YOU are responsible for cleaning up anything you use. You make a mess you clean the mess, take something out, then put it back when you are done, so the next person can use it.<br>\n\n..if you cook it you clean it...lets keep it easy...<br>\n\nYOU must provide your own chairs to sit in.---Do NOT sit in other MEMBERS chairs please use common sense if you want a more comfortable chair --Bring one with!!<br>\n\nPets: although this group LOVES pets it is a camping group and multiple animals often have issues together..just because your dog\/cat\/rabbit\/turtle\/bird is gentle and never causes problems does not mean that someone else's pet will react in kind...so the rule is ONE pet ONLY per trip and it is first request gets the YES...must post in the site area AFTER YOU HAVE SIGNED UP AND PAID FOR EVENT. If you show up to the site with a pet that you do not have a email approval from me ..you will be asked to leave the main site, again this is a safety issue. Please be kind and lets make this a great year. In addition, if you bring a pet with you...if you are found to be neglecting your pet, ie not feeding, ignoring, forgetting, losing etc and other members are taking time to fix these issues you will get ONE and only one gentle reminder \u2026after that you will be removed from the group...Crazy Cool Campers are proud PET owners and we take care of our pets!<br>\n\nCHILDREN: New rules as of 2014 all children under the age of 10 must be off the main site or in their tent if it is a group site...by 10 p.m. NO exceptions...please don't ask just understand that some adults want some down time where they won't have to watch their language etc; Please note we have many Crazy Cool Camper Kids...they are all welcome and wanted. These posts are NOT directed at any one child they are merely designed to accommodate within reason as many members comfort levels as possible while still ensuring our Crazy cool Cids have fun too!<br>\n\n...all children 10 to 13 can remain in the main site until 12:00 p.m<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><br>\n\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-73.7900009155,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/4\/2\/highres_23119266.jpeg","photo_id":23119266,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/4\/2\/600_23119266.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/4\/2\/thumb_23119266.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":12677321,"name":"Denise"},"members":81,"name":"East Coast Tent Crazy Cool Campers","id":1795379,"state":"NY","urlname":"East-Coast-Tent-Crazy-Cool-Campers","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.9199981689,"who":"Crazy Cool Campers!"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Verona","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1299613485000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"babies","name":"Babies","id":15461},{"urlkey":"new-moms","name":"New Moms","id":16208},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147},{"urlkey":"stroller-walking","name":"Stroller Walking","id":19739},{"urlkey":"babies-of-2010","name":"babies of 2010","id":59142},{"urlkey":"babies-of-2011","name":"Babies of 2011","id":110763}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Moms-of-Verona-Caldwell-NJ\/","rating":4.76,"description":"<p>This group was founded in March 2011 and is for moms in the Verona and Caldwell area to get together to meet and socialize.

Whether it's picnics in Prospect Park, fireworks in Coney Island, hanging out in beautiful Brooklyn Bridge Park, or going to Brooklyn's amazing vegetarian restaurants, we'll be hosting events in Brooklyn year-round. <br> <br> * We still love Manhattan. We're going to be painting the town red, as small groups of us go bar-hopping among Manhattan's top bars and lounges. <br> <br> * Except for a couple of large outdoor events we host in the summer, we'll almost always be doing <strong>small<\/strong> events. Our group will continue its tradition of hosting dinners at Manhattan's best small vegan restaurants. <br> <br> * I love the water. Many of our events will be next to (and on) rivers, bays, lakes, and the Atlantic Ocean. <br> <br> * Expect to hear music, see plays, attend cultural events, go dancing, go drinking and clubbing, and generally do the unexpected, the exciting, the elegant, the relaxing and the beautiful. <br> <br> * While this is primarily a social group, we will sometimes engage in vegan activism and animal rights activism. <br> <br> This group is specifically meant for people who are \"socially conscious\" and also very nice. We're that friendly \"do-gooder\" type of vegan. :) We're good-natured and compassionate, AND we like to have a good time. :) <br> <br> Whether you're interested in our Manhattan vegan restaurant dinners, our outdoor and waterside adventures, our Manhattan nightlife, music, and cultural escapades, or our Brooklyn events, we invite you to join us for any or all of the above.

The Seth Audio Collection, The Early Sessions (Books 1-9 of the Seth Material), The Personal Sessions, and other books by Jane Roberts. Author of \"Out Of Body Adventures\" (Contemporary Books 1988), he has been teaching workshops on the Seth material, Dreams, Out of Body Experiences and metaphysics throughout the United States and abroad for over 35 years. He has been on the faculty of many schools throughout the United States and has appeared on numerous radio and television shows. Over a 20 year period Rick worked with Jane's husband Rob Butts on the publication of previously unpublished Seth material.

Again and again, Seth encourages us to take the steps that will lead to a new birth of consciousness, a new far more effective and far more expansive mode of operation, that he has alternately described as the \"higher intellect,\" the \"spacious mind,\" an \"expansion of identity,\" an \"awakening\", the \"magical approach,\" and \"spiritualized creaturehood.\"<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<blockquote>\"When that point of awareness strikes you fully...a new kind of consciousness is born in you...You feel the birth of intellect and intuition together, in a high intellect, in which you recognize your own superior functioning.\" -Seth<\/blockquote>\n<p>In this intimate class setting we will explore key areas of the Seth material and support each other in achieving the \"awakening\" mentioned above. Select Audiotape excerpts of Seth speaking on these topics during Jane Robert's classes, including some never before published, will be integrated into the workshop. Topics covered will include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to trigger the \"higher intellect\" and \"accelerated states of consciousness\"<\/li>\n<li>Using direct links to the wisdom of the inner self<\/li>\n<li>Letting Go - Joining with the spontaneous self.<\/li>\n<li>The inner senses and our capacity for \"Direct Comprehension\"<\/li>\n<li>Conscious creation - The art of using your unlimited energy and power to create your ideal life...<\/li>\n<li>Reconnecting with your non-physical \"entity.\"<\/li>\n<li>Expanding your concept of identity and becoming a \"new, larger\" you.<\/li>\n<li>The \"magical\" approach and the pitfalls of the conventional \"rational\" approach.<\/li>\n<li>Moving out of the \"official line of consciousness\" - How to break free from stubborn cultural limiting belief systems.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-73.6800003052,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/a\/d\/highres_22319309.jpeg","photo_id":22319309,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/a\/d\/600_22319309.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/a\/d\/thumb_22319309.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14353828,"name":"Rick Stack "},"members":43,"name":"New York City Seth Study Group (Instructor-Rick Stack)","id":1805904,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-City-Seth-Study-Group-Instructor-Rick-Stack","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Seth readers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Long Island City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1301330812000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"wahm","name":"Work at Home Moms","id":4082},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"business-coaching","name":"Business Coaching","id":12669},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Queens-Business-Networking-Group\/","rating":4.71,"description":"<p>Welcome to <strong>\"The Queens Business Networking Group (QBNG)\"<\/strong>. <br \/><br \/>For <strong>4 years our main group The NYCBNG has been a leader<\/strong> in hosting business networking events.

Typically, according to the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fourthbranchofamerica.com\/Importanceofbees.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Department of Agriculture<\/a>, these under-appreciated workers pollinate 80 percent of our flowering crops which constitute 1\/3 of everything we eat. Losing them could affect not only dietary staples such as apples, broccoli, strawberries, nuts, asparagus, blueberries and cucumbers, but may threaten our beef and dairy industries if alfalfa is not available for feed. One Cornell University study estimated that honeybees annually pollinate $14 billion worth of seeds and crops in the U.S. Essentially, if honeybees disappear, they could take most of our insect pollinated plants with them, potentially reducing mankind to little more than a water diet.\" (http:\/\/www.mnn.com\/local-reports\/pennsylvania\/local-blog\/the-importance-of-honeybees)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health Benefits of Local and Raw Honey<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Read about how local honey helps allergies at: http:\/\/health.howstuffworks.com\/diseases-conditions\/allergies\/allergy-treatments\/local-honey-for-allergies.htm<\/p>\n<p>Visit this site for other health benefits of raw honey: \u00a0http:\/\/www.livestrong.com\/article\/246023-what-are-the-benefits-of-pure-honey\/<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for your support!<\/p>\n<p>Debra Butera<\/p>","lon":-74.0899963379,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/d\/1\/highres_43781681.jpeg","photo_id":43781681,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/d\/1\/600_43781681.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/d\/1\/thumb_43781681.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11922704,"name":"Debra Butera"},"members":84,"name":"Staten Island Beekeepers","id":1808695,"state":"NY","urlname":"Staten-Island-Beekeepers","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.5999984741,"who":"Beekeepers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Bloomfield","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1301761130000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"fiction","name":"Fiction","id":15113},{"urlkey":"literature","name":"Literature","id":15321},{"urlkey":"reading","name":"Reading","id":15360},{"urlkey":"novel-reading","name":"Novel Reading","id":15622},{"urlkey":"readers","name":"Readers","id":17219},{"urlkey":"non-fiction","name":"Non-Fiction","id":22129}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Bloomfield-Reading-Group\/","rating":4.74,"description":"<p><strong><span>This book club is for anyone who enjoys reading books, relaxing over a cup of coffee and having a great conversation. &nbsp;We read different genres each month and meet to discuss the book and share our thoughts and ideas openly. &nbsp;Our Meetings are on the last Friday of the month at around 7pm.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>If you are looking for a reading group were you can relax, laugh, share stories and<\/span> make new friends you've found it!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>","lon":-74.1900024414,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/a\/8\/highres_68932392.jpeg","photo_id":68932392,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/a\/8\/600_68932392.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/a\/8\/thumb_68932392.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":6735596,"name":"Valerie "},"members":217,"name":"The Bloomfield Reading Group","id":1808703,"state":"NJ","urlname":"The-Bloomfield-Reading-Group","category":{"name":"literature\/writing","id":18,"shortname":"literature-writing"},"lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1301845563000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"selfdefense","name":"Self-Defense","id":443},{"urlkey":"martial","name":"Martial Arts","id":681},{"urlkey":"jeetkunedo","name":"Jeet Kune Do","id":3098},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"sports","name":"Sports and Recreation","id":10451},{"urlkey":"group-fitness-training","name":"Group Fitness Training","id":15394},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"kung-fu","name":"Kung Fu","id":26924},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"shaolin-kung-fu","name":"Shaolin Kung Fu","id":136134}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/shaolin-five-animals\/","rating":4.98,"description":"<p><strong>About the System:<\/strong> <br> Shaolin Five Animal Kung Fu is a way of self-defense, fitness, and self-development for unity of mind, body and spirit.

wine buffs (mostly early 30's to early 40's)<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000\">who live in the city, and get together several times a month in a\u00a0private, relaxed setting\u00a0 with comfy seating and large screen TV, for\u00a0film, food &amp; wine parties.\u00a0<br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">We romp around the globe, pairing up foreign (sometimes just indie)\u00a0films with foreign wines, and sometimes\u00a0 vodka, rum and whiskey, (hey...apparently they can't grow grapes in Denmark), along with appetizers, side dishes\u00a0and desserts.\u00a0<br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">Since we meet in private homes and want to create an environment where everyone really gets a chance to talk to each other, our events are typically limited to 10 - 12 guests, who each come on their own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">Our set-up\u00a0is a wonderful way to meet new people who share the same interests and spark\u00a0thought-provoking and passionate conversations.<\/span> <span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : 16px\">And sometimes we just laugh our butts off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">Each event has its own special twist for the wine &amp; food, and everyone attending brings something that complements the film.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">Our goal is to create a fun-themed dinner party around a movie....and the end result is often pretty amazing, as we have some super-talented chefs among us, who often whip up masterpieces that are truly a treat.\u00a0 But no worries at all if you don't cook!

It was concealed from the masses up until the end of the 20th century. Now we live in a special time, when Kabbalah becomes available to everyone who has an interest in spirituality. Bnei Baruh is a non-profit organization . Everything it offers is free to use: online classes, book downloads, etc. The goal is not to make a profit, but to make authentic Kabbalah accessible to all who are ready to learn. If you are ready, join us and all our friends around the world on this fascinating journey - a quest to gain an inner knowledge of nature of everything that ever was, is and will be. Kabbalah is not about believing, but about getting to know.

My daughter, almost 3, is Chinese &amp; Korean and just starting to talk up a storm.  She sings songs in Chinese, counts to 10 in Korean but speaks mostly in English.  I want to make sure she's fluent in every language but don't want to confuse her.  I've got lots of questions and am surprised at how little there is out there to help our little ones along.<\/p>\r\n<p>I created this meetup group to unite multilingual families and provide events where they can share info and experience to help each other succeed. I'm going to be organizing events with speakers who can tackle issues like when to introduce the 2nd or 3rd language and what is going on with the kids in their development at different ages.  Speakers will also address the emotional and cultural issues within mixed ethnic background families.<\/p>\r\n<p>My personal passion for this group stems from my own inability to converse in Korean.  I can read and write Korean but my parents came from a generation that believed their kids wouldn't succeed in English if they were taught Korean.  I cannot converse with my relatives, only their children who grew up here speaking English.  I can speak French better than Korean which I learned in high school.  This has frustrated me all my life.  I believe that children are sponges and very capable of several languages, and in this changing world isn't it necessary?  I'd just like to help make it as easy and fun as possible.  Anyone with me?

I created this group because I'm committed to achieving my dreams and I want to offer that same opportunity to those around the world. I live in NYC AND this group is for everyone on the planet. The purpose of this group is to create a powerful 'master mind' effect for each and everyone of us. What that means is to create a group of people who have big dreams and goals in their life and are also desiring to be around others who aspire to achieve whatever they choose to BE, DO or HAVE in their life. The effect of being around a group of people who are like minded, positive, and entrepreneurial who are up to manifesting great things in their life is AMAZING. It's similar to 1+1=3! You get more than usual with other's focused energy. Solo, you'd get the more boring 1+1 = 2. The only requirement is that you've listened to a specific CD\/audio set that is all about you creating and manifesting anything and everything you want in your life. It's a requirement only because it will allow us to support each other. There is a certain way of thinking and believing that you are introduced to in the training so by listening we'll all be on the same page and in essence be speaking the 'same language'. If you are interested in BEING, DOING or HAVING anything you want in your life please contact me and I'll start you off by sending you 2 mp3 files that last about 35-40 minutes in total that'll let you know if this group or information is truly for you or not. Either way it's fine. It may not be for everyone. It just allows you to get clear on what this is about so you're clear on what this is about. I look forward to hearing from you and helping YOU ACHIEVE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BE, DO OR HAVE IN YOUR LIFE. FEEL GOOD NOW!

We raise awareness in communities through hosting educational events and speaking engagements. We collaborate with government agencies and non-governmental organizations to establish acceptable preventive measures, identify victims, expose traffickers and users, and promote slave-free practices. We provide funding for programs that support survivors of human trafficking through medical assistance, vocational training and economical development, so that survivors are better prepared to re-enter society.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : justify\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : justify\">Slavery still exists; it is just better hidden today than it was in the past. In fact, there are currently more human slaves in the world than ever before in history &ndash; an estimated 27 million adults and 13 million children around the world are victims of human trafficking. Every year, over a million men, women, and children fall into the hands of traffickers, in their own countries and abroad. Human trafficking is a crime against humanity. It deprives people of their human rights and freedoms, it is a global health risk, and it fuels organized crime. Victims are used for a range of exploitative purposes - sexual exploitation, forced labor, organ harvesting, and combat fighting, among many others.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : justify\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : justify\">The Human Trafficking Awareness (HTA) Council was founded to fight against this horrific evil and we are asking for your help.

Move naturally and easily into higher areas of awareness and help life flow in a smoother and happier direction. One form of personal meditation we explore is known as a \"Spiritual Exercise\". This form of simple meditation, using your creative imagination, strengthens your inner guidance and helps you recognize your true identity as Soul, an eternal and divine spark of God.<\/p>\n<p>Nothing needs to be taken on faith. Experience it yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Have you had one of the following spiritual experiences? Come and share; learn more about connecting to direct guidance and achieving personal growth.<\/p>\n<p>* Past-life recall or having a sense that you have lived before (in a meditation or dream)<\/p>\n<p>* Dreams -- that opened awareness, expanded your consciousness, told of a future event, gave you an answer<\/p>\n<p>* Out-of-body or near death experience * Seeing an inner light<\/p>\n<p>* Hearing an inner sound<\/p>\n<p>* Inner guidance (angel, spiritual master, departed loved one)<\/p>\n<p>* Knowingness (intuition, coincidence, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu)<\/p>\n<p>* Unconditional love (from a family member, friend, pet, etc.)<\/p>\n<p>* Sense of oneness, divine love<\/p>\n<p>* Connection with all life -- greater awareness, feeling of inner peace<\/p>\n<p>Creative techniques are discussed in these Meetups to further explore our inner worlds. Similar to meditation, yet more active, these contemplation techniques, such as singing the ancient love song to God, HU, (pronounced 'hue\") helps with self improvement, brings self empowerment through greater inner understanding, opens consciousness, helps in understanding how karma is created, how to work through it, and gives guidance on how to achieve states of Self and God Realization.<\/p>\n<p>HU, this ancient and sacred word for God, can be found in the Jewish Kabala, Christian Gregorian chant, Buddhism, the Sufi teachings, Chinese Taoism, as well as in the path of Eckankar. It is a universal word with a very high vibration. You are invited to try it anytime you would like, either out loud or silently to experience the effects for yourself.

Classes meet from 6:00 PM &ndash; 9:00 PM at 440 Studios, 440 Lafayette  Street. The cost is $495.00<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>Why:<\/strong><span> I know the excitement of being in a screenwriting workshop and chipping away at a screenplay until you find what is essential. I will share with you the tremendous insight and training I received from the celebrated faculty at Columbia University&rsquo;s graduate film program, while studying for my MFA degree.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">When I receive feedback on my own scripts, I often feel that some of the comments are rather obvious. Why didn't I see that? Even more helpful are the notes about what is confusing, unmotivated, and arbitrary. We all become absorbed in our work and can lose the perspective needed to evaluate our screenplays. This Revision Workshop is designed for you &ndash; the writer, who wants to further develop your screenplay.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">In all of the screenwriting, directing, and producing classes I have taken at Columbia, at the core of each class is the underlying script. Without that, there is no eventual film. Workshop classes, where students bring in early drafts of scripts, can be intimidating, at first. We think to ourselves, &ldquo;I sweated and slaved to write this draft. I know it&rsquo;s good. I don&rsquo;t want someone else&rsquo;s criticism!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s all valid, up to a point.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">Despite the solitary hours &ndash; and hours &ndash; we all spend writing, in the end, a final screenplay is actually a result of input from several people. Eventually we want to hand over the cleanest, purest expression of our story to an agent, manager, producer, or director. I know the excitement of sitting in class and hear someone suggest a new idea to incorporate into someone else&rsquo;s script. Where did that come from? How much more dramatic is the story if I increase the obstacles, and actually make it harder for the protagonist to achieve his goal?<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">Together, the class will offer ideas, opinions, and suggestions &ndash; all to help you write the story you intend. Sometimes the best ideas come from listening to what is said about another&rsquo;s person&rsquo;s screenplay. As needed, the class will also consist of a review of the fundamentals of screenplay craft, including structure, conflict, character development, and exposition. Also, tools to begin revising a script and a clear approach to completing the next draft will be clearly articulated. Class participants will have the opportunity to present their work at least twice, and will be encouraged to offer their work for review more frequently.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>A little about me: <\/strong><span>I am award-winning screenwriter and received my MFA degree from the School of the Arts at Columbia University. Prior to returning to school, I had worked in film and theatre as a writer, director and producer for close to 15 years, and am the author of several screenplays and stage plays. I currently have a screenplay in development. My spec script, &ldquo;30 Rock: Seeing is Believing,&rdquo; was recognized as a Faculty Select, in addition to being awarded Best Teleplay, as part of the 2009 Columbia University Film Festival. \"The Prion Complex\" is a finalist for the Columbia University\/Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Screenwriting Award. I have also graduated of the University of Pennsylvania, the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of the Law and am the Artistic Director of East Park Productions, a not-for-profit company devoted to the development of new works for film and theatre. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>When: <\/strong><span>This 8-week workshop begins on Wednesday, June 15 and continues through Wednesday, August 3.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>Time:<\/strong><span> Each class meets from 6:00 PM &ndash; 9:00 PM.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>Fee: <\/strong>$495.00.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>Where:<\/strong> Class meets at 440 Studios, 440 Lafayette Street, across from the Public Theater.

Why now?<\/strong><br>\n\nGraph structures and methods are being used everywhere. As the size of datasets being generated, processed, and presented continues to grow, the relative strengths and weaknesses of different data structures, including graphs, have become more and more significant in everyday applications. Meanwhile, wider awareness of graph concepts (thanks in large part to the popularity of online social networks and widespread adoption of machine learning techniques) has increased the use of graph methods in a variety of fields. As a result, the last few years have seen renewed interest in academic circles, and a large number of companies and independent efforts putting a great deal of effort into creating faster, more scalable, and more reliable graph databases and ever more powerful interfaces.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why another meetup? Isn't [NoSQL NYC, etc.] enough?<\/strong><br>\n\nWe don't think so. There are many great NoSQL meetups, but the current pace of innovation in graph database technology and graph theory is such that keeping on top of developments requires an immense amount of dedication. Our intention is to save our members time, money, and effort by providing a venue for sharing domain-specific experiences and best practices, scheduling useful programs for people at all levels of knowledge and experience, and creating a strong local community around graphs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Am I missing something?

Mindfulness is a part of everyone's experience and can be utilized to help us&nbsp;with: anxiety, depression and stress. Mindfulness also helps us cultivate greater resiliency for life's inevitable&nbsp;ups and downs.<\/p>\n<p>Our suffering is real and no surprise with the speed and complexity of our lives as well as the stunning degree of change that our society and world are manifesting daily. It is no wonder that we are stressed out and our coping mechanisms are often at the limit of their effectiveness, which can make exhaustion a frequent experience.<\/p>\n<p>This meetup is for those who are attracted to changing their relationship to stress via mindfulness meditation practices.

Kirtan meditation consists of hearing and chanting sanskrit names for God to the accompaniment of melodious and rhythmic music in order to invoke God's divine mercy and presence. Bhagavad Gita As It Is is studied according to the ancient, yet unbroken, chain of teachers, as taught originally by Krishna and eventually Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Rupa Goswami, and more recently A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.<\/p>\n<p>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is. Everyone will read verses together from the Bhagavad Gita, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. Atma and Subhie will together explain the Bhagavad Gita verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for a combined forty years. We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p>\n<p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful Bhagavad Gita As It Is with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, will be available for any member who might choose to take one home for a suggested donation of $10.<\/p>\n<p>This meetup is intended for everyone who is interested without discrimination and regardless of one's familiarity with the subject matter. Please come and relish this most wonderful discussion and kirtan, celebrating the glories of bhakti yoga, i.e., devotional service to God, who is known according to the Bhagavad Gita by the name Krishna.<\/p>\n<p>Here is the general schedule of our meetups: we begin the evening with a kirtan that lasts about twenty minutes -- until about 8:20 p.m. Then, we have a class on Bhagavad Gita As It Is, which lasts for about an hour and twenty minutes. In the class, we will go through verses of the Gita in order, continuing from where the last class left off, with questions pertaining to those verses being encouraged throughout the class. By about 9:40, the last kirtan begins; it lasts for about twenty minutes. A delicious and nutritious vegetarian dinner is served after that.<\/p>\n<p>Admission to each meetup is free. Donations for the meetup's expenses are welcome, but not at all required!<\/p>\n<p>Atma is an initiated priest who since 1990 has been studying, teaching, and living according to the teachings of the Bhagavad-Gita as taught and followed by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. After living in a monastic setting for eight years, Atma resumed his undergraduate education at Brown University, where he hosted weekly programs that focused on kirtan and Bhagavad Gita. He then enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School from which he graduated in 2004 and from which he received a merit scholarship for 75% of tuition. Currently, Atma spends his weekdays as a securities fraud federal prosecutor. His primary goal is to imbibe in his own life the devotional teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and to share the same with others as a humble offering to God.<\/p>\n<p>Subhie has been living her life according to the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita since 1991 and is also an initiated priest. Subhie lived in a monastic setting until 2005. From 1991 to 2005, Subhie taught Bhagavad Gita in Croatia, Serbia, Greece, Germany, and United Kingdom. Subhie spent several years studying Vedic knowledge in India, primarily in the holy town, Vrindavana. After 2005, Subhie resumed her undergraduate education in religion at the University of London -- and then locally at Queens College, after she moved to New York and married Atma. Subhie also got her Master's degree in teaching at Queens College. &nbsp;She is currently an elementary school teacher.<\/p>","lon":-73.5599975586,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/a\/2\/highres_234066562.jpeg","photo_id":234066562,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/a\/2\/600_234066562.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/a\/2\/thumb_234066562.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13758142,"name":"Atma & Subhie"},"members":139,"name":"Kirtan Yoga & Bhagavad Gita As It Is Discourses--Long Island","id":2049371,"state":"NY","urlname":"Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita-Long-Island","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1308609319000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"sports","name":"Sports and Recreation","id":10451},{"urlkey":"womens-fitness","name":"Women's Fitness","id":15123},{"urlkey":"group-fitness-training","name":"Group Fitness Training","id":15394},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/StormYoga\/","rating":4.68,"description":"<p>Storm Yoga is a not for profit founded on the principle that yoga is not for a small niche of people, but is an integral part of a broader movement to transform our society.<\/p>\n<p>To this end we provide both FREE and donation based yoga classes across New York City.

It was concealed from the masses up until the end of the 20th century. Now we live in a special time, when Kabbalah becomes available to everyone who has an interest in spirituality. Bnei Baruh is a non-profit organization . Everything it offers is free to use: online classes, book downloads, etc. The goal is not to make a profit, but to make authentic Kabbalah accessible to all who are ready to learn. If you are ready, join us and all our friends around the world on this fascinating journey - a quest to gain an inner knowledge of nature of everything that ever was, is and will be. Kabbalah is not about believing, but about getting to know.

Most of the time at these meeting was wasted listening to elevator pitches - because no was really listening! They were thinking about what they had to say instead of what everyone else had to say. Nobody was buying because everybody was selling. We might listen to a few chosen speakers and a list of announcements... It seemed like we were doing everything except networking. In the little time that was left people were focused on grabbing what business cards they could. At the other extreme social events are fine, but they tend to be loud, it is hard to hear and you have no way of knowing who else is in the room. It is very inefficient, particularily if you are new to the group. The purpose of this group employ a simple, new system that eliminates everything that doesn't directly contribute to networking. to help business people build strategic alliances, identify prospects and promote themselves faster and more efficiently than ever before. There are no membership fees or application fees. We do charge a modest event fee so that we can have a dedicated space rather than a noisy restaurant or diner.

The group focuses on a new topic each&nbsp;month and all members have a chance to share their ideas. At Socrates Cafe, everyone is a teacher and everyone is a student - we all have brilliance to offer. Together we can contribute to building a deeper understanding of some of life's thornier questions.<\/p>\n<p>The group will meet around once a month from 7-9 PM. Meeting place is&nbsp;at a spacious caf\u00e9 near Herald Square. The first half of the meeting will be a general discussion of the central question. The second half will be a discussion of more specific aspects and questions about the topic.<\/p>\n<p>With some flexibility, we will be going around the table (with an option to 'pass') so that everyone has the opportunity to speak. There will also be open discussion as time allows.<\/p>\n<p>Note: Take a look at topic ideas under the 'discussion' tab. Look for the 'Current List of Topics' discussion heading.

Informal, fun. Learn how to play, improve, or keep your chops up. Meet locals and enjoy the evening in the shade. We play multiple games each week, with players rotating freely to form new teams each game. We don't \"pick teams\" so you don't have to worry about being last-picked.<\/p>\n<p>Who: All levels and ages welcome. If you become impatient with beginners, perhaps this isn't for you. However, you don't have to be a beginner--if you can encourage strangers to improve and play alongside all levels, then this is for you! When: Every Thursday in July and August, 7-9pm Generally, this is rain-or-shine, but if it's an awful rainy day all day long, we'll probably cancel. We'll do our best to inform folks if that's the case, but last summer we even played during light showers!<\/p>\n<p>Where: There are two Volleyball courts behind the Ft. Washington 190th St. A-line subway station. To get there:<\/p>\n<p>--From Ft. Washington Ave., go down the stairs as if entering the subway station at the roundabout at the S. entrance to Ft. Tryon park, and instead of making a left into the station, continue down a second flight of stairs to arrive at the courts.<\/p>\n<p>--From Bennett Ave., enter the 190th St. A station through the tunnel, go up the elevators instead of going to the platform. Exit the station, and make a left down the stairs to the courts (going up the stairs instead puts you on Ft. Washington Ave.)<\/p>\n<p>--If you're taking the A line, exit 190th St. through the northernmost station exit, take the elevator up, and continue as above.<\/p>\n<p>We usually get a full court going, and there's a second court we can spill onto. When we have more folks, we rotate players in between games. These games are organized by Uptown Community Church in Washington Heights. That said, it's not a \"church event,\" but a way to bring everyone together in our great neighborhood! Come out and play! Lastly--if you're prone to mosquito bites, bring repellant! There are no water fountains at this location, so bring fluids, too. The courts are shielded from evening sunlight, so you may not need sunscreen.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br \/>Balls and nets are provided!<\/p>","lon":-73.9400024414,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/6\/c\/1\/highres_45530881.jpeg","photo_id":45530881,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/6\/c\/1\/600_45530881.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/6\/c\/1\/thumb_45530881.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":21274671,"name":"Randy G."},"members":201,"name":"Ft.

At the heart of the Society is our monthly meetup, where we share music with one another and have special presentations from guitarists, composers, and luthiers on topics of interest to guitarists. We also have a fast-growing guitar orchestra open to all that performs new and traditional repertoire and provides a great opportunity to play with other guitarists and improve musical skills. We present 13 concerts a year in two different concert series. Our main series presents some of the world's top classical guitarists in the acoustically fantastic venue of Engelman Recital Hall at the Baruch Performing Arts Center. The other series, our Second Sundays Series, showcases some of the top emerging artists in the classical guitar world in an intimate venue at the Roger Smith Hotel.<\/p>\n<p>We would love for you to be a part of the NYCCGS!

Awareness of your energetic state (how you feel, where you feel what, how your environment is affecting you, how to not feel drained after meetings, phone calls, long travel, long days at the office, etc). We're also trained in some more well-known asana yoga traditions and martial arts traditions.

My latest find was a fully working Xbox for just $12 - it even had a game in it that they didn't know about.

I know you're out there and are busy with your professional lives and perhaps you have family obligations as I do. The purpose of this group is to initially meet for a bimonthly game of Pathfinder and to escape from reality a couple times a month. I've had the books for two years now &amp; I've kept putting off this group because other things just keep coming up. That's life, right? It's now or never. I believe the bimonthly meetup will allow greater flexibility in the beginning. This group is for players that are 30 years old and up so if you don't make the requirement please don't ask to be a member of the group.&nbsp; If you are interested in a group that plays by the rules although bends them at times (who has time or the patience to keep track of how much you're carrying or&nbsp;your rations&nbsp;in the game although what player could carry 5 suits of full plate anyway?) then this is the group for you. The group will not simply be a hack and slash type of group although I'm sure there will be lots of encounters and melee. If you want a primarily hack and slash type of play then join a MMO game or a younger D&amp;D v4.0 group&nbsp;so you don't waste our time or yours.&nbsp; I find the most efficient use of time is to utilize modules and some creativity. The groups I have most enjoyed in the past usually rotated with a different person hosting each game at their home. Having said all this I do want to add that I am a very open minded gamer and I still am learning the Pathfinder game myself although I believe my experience with v3.5 of D&amp;D has helped prep me for this.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you don't meet the age requirements (30 y.o.)&nbsp;then I'd recommend looking at some of the local gamestores as well as other message boards.&nbsp; Best to you in your endeavors.<\/p>","lon":-74.3600006104,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/8\/e\/6\/highres_59139142.jpeg","photo_id":59139142,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/8\/e\/6\/600_59139142.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/8\/e\/6\/thumb_59139142.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":3796819,"name":"RPGamer1971"},"members":110,"name":"Pathfinder Dungeons and Dragons version 3.5 RPG Meetup","id":2545442,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Pathfinder-Dungeons-and-Dragons-version-3-5-RPG-Meetup","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":40.9099998474,"who":"Adventurers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Middle Village","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1317059103000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"autism-professionals-network","name":"Autism Professionals Network","id":455992},{"urlkey":"supports-coordination","name":"Supports Coordination","id":456202},{"urlkey":"autism-services-delivery","name":"Autism Services Delivery","id":456212},{"urlkey":"mr-dd-professionals","name":"MR\/DD Professionals","id":456282}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Autism-Awareness-Acceptance-AAA-w-Play4Autism\/","rating":5,"description":"<p><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span style=\"color : #0000ff ; font-size : medium\">We invite all those who are involved in the care of individuals with autism and autistic spectrum disorders to share their knowledge, insights and collaborate on providing direct services; planning, implementation and management of Play4Autism programs and services.<\/span> <span style=\"font-size : 14px\"><span><span style=\"color : #0000ff ; font-size : medium\">As we team up in spreading awareness &amp; acceptance as well as offering support to children and their families.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nThank you for taking the time to read through our sites and we look forward to you being a member of the P4A Team.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nGreg Vasicek<br>\n\nPresident &amp; Founder<br>\n\nPlay4Autism Foundation<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>","lon":-73.8799972534,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/4\/7\/e\/highres_363590302.jpeg","photo_id":363590302,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/4\/7\/e\/600_363590302.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/4\/7\/e\/thumb_363590302.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":2480299,"name":"Helena L.

With many of their savings and retirement accounts wiped out due to the current recession, this group has been hung out to dry in the job seeking process. Even worse, the process of finding a job has dramatically changed from applying in person to applying online--where older job seekers are up against thousands of tech savvy young college graduates. Recently unemployed myself, I came to the realization that the 40 and up age group just doesn't get the attention it needs and deserves. I felt that it was time for me to do something about it and make a real difference.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Purpose:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The purpose of this group is to join together and support the unemployed and employed job seekers over 40 who have been negatively impacted by this economy. We want to be the largest Over 40 job networking group in New York City, and eventually the country. This group will meet on a regular basis (monthly or quarterly) to network, share personal stories, and share career advice. Most importantly, we will have fun!!!\u00a0This group will be open to suggestions by any of its members on where and when to meet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who Should Join:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Although this group is open to all ages who want to provide support, we encourage all 40 and up job seekers (employed or unemployed) who have been displaced by today's economy to join. This group also welcomes all job providers who believe they can offer job opportunities or advice.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>**Please visit our sponsor's website at 40ForHire.com to preview what is being developed to make our lives easier.
