We call it a *lingam puja* (borrowing the Hindu term).<\/p> <p>Please note that the ritual itself is non-sexual and fully clothed. We invoke the Divine in its female and male aspects, as goddess and as god. We bear witness to one another's intentions and prayers. We name into the circle those we hold in our hearts.<\/p> <p><br\/>We walk as a group in meditation around the Phallus and pay individual devotion to it as we're moved. We end with a final group embrace. We meet under a 200-year-old oak, with light glinting off the Hudson. It's a simple but powerful practice with room for whatever you're holding in your body and soul.<\/p> <p>There will be a chance to spend some time together afterwards somewhere nearby.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-TcPcQlTX7jg\/UltuYTxhF9I\/AAAAAAAABDI\/hC52lHLPN5c\/s400\/puja+sept+3.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/a\/c\/600_388204012.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/a\/e\/6\/600_365751942.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>About the facilitator<\/b><\/p> <p>David Townsend is a gay man, a facilitator and sacred intimate committed to gay and bisexual men in our journey toward a bigger, freer, more joyful life.

If you've ever taken ProTools classes or recording classes, you are still a beginner in live sound techniques and are in need of this workshop.<\/p> <p>Is this Workshop for You?<\/p> <p>This interactive live sound workshop\u00a0is for you if you are doing gigs (or looking to do gigs) and want\u00a0to know how to communicate clearly and professionally with the live sound engineers in\u00a0NYC\u00a0venues.<\/p> <p>After completing the workshop you\u00a0will also be able to do basic sound for yourself if you encounter the NYC venues that require this skill. (Surprisingly, there are some great ones that\u00a0have the bartender point you to the mixer and\u00a0leave you to do it all yourself!)<\/p> <p>Who This Workshop is\u00a0Not\u00a0For<\/p> <p>This is not for anyone who already has extensive live sound experience.\u00a0This is a beginner level class geared towards performers.<\/p> <p>If you are not a performer you are welcome to attend, but know that the class will be taught with the performer in mind.<\/p> <p>Skills You'll Learn<\/p> <p>\u2022 Mic Stand Setup Tricks<br\/>\u2022 Pro Cable Wrapping Techniques<br\/>\u2022 EQ, Compression, and Reverb<br\/>\u2022 Basics of the Mixer (Also known as a \"Sound Board\" or \"Desk\")<br\/>\u2022 Much More!<\/p> <p>Questions You'll Be Able to Answer<br\/>\u2022 Why can't I hear myself?<br\/>\u2022 Why did I just hear that horrible feedback?\u00a0<br\/>\u2022 What are the different pieces of gear all around the sound person?<br\/>\u2022 We will cover as much as we can in three hours and then we will relax with some question and answer time and networking.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-New-York-Singer-Songwriters\/events\/224364920\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":14400000,"name":"Live Sound Workshop for Performers","id":"224364920","time":1439658000000,"updated":1439675680000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1309843458000,"name":"The New York Singer Songwriters","group_lon":-74,"id":2122721,"urlname":"The-New-York-Singer-Songwriters","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"742 10th Ave (between 50 and 51 Sts.","name":"Columbus Library","lon":-74.005974,"id":3720432,"state":"NY","lat":40.714352,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.60664105415,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438363715000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":2},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Ever hear a song on the radio and wonder why it sounds good?

Manhattan. Saturday, August 15th @ 1 PM<\/p> <p>Gotham Yacht Club is looking for fun sailors and non-sailors to join us this weekend!<\/p> <p>We take trips around the Manhattan area in a 50-foot Beneteau. We usually sail the Hudson--the Statue of Liberty to the George Washington Bridge--but also go to Martha's Vineyard, the Hamptons and the Jersey Shore.<\/p> <p>We like to fill the boat up with about 20-30 people. No sailing experience is required, but preference is given to experienced sailors since the trips can\u2019t happen without them.\u00a0 As space is limited on the boat, simply RSVP\u2019ing \u201cYes\u201d to an event does not guarantee a spot on the boat.\u00a0 If a spot is available, you will be contacted directly with event details.<\/p> <p>Sailors can take their first trip to get acquainted and enjoy the party.\u00a0 From then on, sailors can choose to (1) work the morning shift and help out with the launch or (2) work the evening shift and help out with the return.\u00a0 Generally, sailors spend less than a third of the trip working and can take the rest of the time to relax and socialize.<\/p> <p>The current crew is made up of young, educated Manhattan professionals. We are looking to meet new people who will enjoy the atmosphere and company of everyone on the boat.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you and\/or your friends are interested, please copy, paste, and fill out the questionnaire below in an email and send to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>. Please include your current email address so that we can contact you directly.\u00a0 Since boat trips fill up in advance and we receive many applicants, we may not get back to you immediately. \u00a0<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you on the water!<\/p> <p>EVERY APPLICANT (REVELERS, SUNBATHERS, ETC.)<\/p> <p>Q) Please provide a link to your page on Facebook or other social networking site.

Does paranormal or psi activity like clairvoyance and telepathy exist? Is our world completely material, or is there a non-physical domain? What might have existed before the Big Bang? What does the future hold in store for us? Is the universe eternal? Do aliens exist? What aspects of religion make sense, and what aspects don\u2019t? Is euthanasia moral? Do we humans have a free will? What is intelligence? Is there an abiding personal self? What changes should our world make to ensure the brightest future? Is evolution and endogenous or exogenous process? How much different are humans from other animals?<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We're usually close to the 55th St. entrance.

These challenges come in many forms and what is a challenge for one is not an issue for another. So everyone is unique and comes with their own set of experiences. But there are universal issues that we all face.\u00a0 The principal ones are money, love, weight, health, and career. We are raised to believe that the way to face these challenges is through hard work and a little knowledge. But nothing could be further from the truth. This is because success is not a set formula that anyone can follow. Everyone must take their own path to getting what they want and there is no one-size-fits-all template to success.<\/p> <p>Yet one thing is clear. Many go their entire lives working hard, waiting for their ships to come in yet with no or limited success. \u00a0Even worse, some seem to be magnets for money and success in life without putting in a hard day\u2019s work. \u00a0But why? Is the universe unfair? On the contrary, there is rhyme and reason to the madness. First off, you must understand that to overcome challenges in your life you have to get right to the source. Unfortunately, our society is caught up in verbal trickery. What I mean by that is that many come along with PHDs at the end of their names and try to address your issues through a verbal discourse in the hope that through deductive reasoning you will come to an understanding of what is the root cause of your plight. Millions of dollars are spent on this type of discredited Freudian treatment.<\/p> <p>But how many have been told to stop smoking, stop over-eating, stop taking drugs, stop dating that selfish person, yet they continue to do so knowing full well that what awaits them is likely to be pain and suffering. This is because verbal communication cannot change behavior no matter how passionate you are. How many preachers and ministers whose faith seems unbreakable are caught with their pants down in some type of indiscretion?<\/p> <p>Let us examine slavery for example. Many of the chief architects of this horrible atrocity were Christians, Muslims and Catholics. But if they were holy men and women how could they have endorsed the capture and enslavement of an entire continent of people? This is because their religions relied on sermons and verbal language through scriptures as a means to try and spiritually uplift people. This simply does not work. Our ancient ancestors knew this simple truth. This is why most indigenous cultures practiced meditation and trance induction as a means to communicate directly with the subconscious mind, which is the seat of your power.\u00a0 Now many are turning to hypnotherapy to control their weight, stop smoking or drug-taking, and to relieve pain from surgery or relationships. \u00a0These therapists and patients have finally realized that the power to effect change lies not in the conscious mind but rather the subconscious mind. We must realize that the conscious mind can only execute what the subconscious mind directs it to.\u00a0 The effectiveness of this type of treatment has been proven in many scientific papers and studies. Yet still to this day many are unaware of the success rate of techniques such as hypnotherapy and trance induction. This is because those in control, the global elite, have imprisoned our minds in left brain externalized thinking.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/6\/0\/600_439796928.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>HYPNOTHERAPY MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE<\/p> <p><br\/>Although it\u2019s on the cutting edge of mind therapy, hypnotherapists have made a critical error. They have treated the subconscious mind like a computer. Their psychology being what you put in is what you get out. This is untrue and demonstrates a true gap in their understanding of men and women. It was our ancient so-called primitive ancestors who referred to the subconscious mind as \u201cthe spirit\u201d or \u201cthe indwelling intelligence\u201d.\u00a0 They knew early on that the subconscious was consciousness and was intelligent. Hence it is omnipresent and omniscient.\u00a0 This indwelling intelligence doesn\u2019t just serve to direct the conscious mind based on commands you program into it, this intelligence is responsible for everything that happens to you in the physical world. It creates the very reality you see before you.<\/p> <p>This means it plays an active role in your life and is not just relegated to dreams, nightmares and subconscious thoughts and traumas. It is what some in the new age movement call your higher mind. It is all-knowing and connected to everything we experience. \u00a0If fact, there really is only one consciousness that we all share.\u00a0 But we erroneously believe there is a division within consciousness. There is only division within our physical bodies, which separate us on this planet.<\/p> <p>Treating the indwelling intelligence within you like a dumb computer that can only be programmed to accomplish the task it is given is to severely limit the power it can accomplish for you. Yes, it\u2019s true you must either program it or command it to perform a task but because it is a super-intelligence it is one thousand steps ahead of your perception. In fact, when you are born it is already aware of your destiny and aligns circumstance to allow you to fulfill the objective of your new incarnation. If you do not program it, it will proceed on its own and lay the foundations for either your success or failure.\u00a0 But in reality there is no failure, only experience, so what appears to you as a futile attempt is a great experience for the intelligence within. Remember, its goal is to experience reality based on the destiny you have agreed to prior to coming to this physical plane of existence.\u00a0 So as it sees it there are no good or bad experiences, only information to help it grow in understanding. But this is a discussion for another time; for now we want to focus on empowering you.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/f\/d\/a\/600_439797306.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>YOUR SUFFERING IS A NEEDLESS ACT<\/p> <p><br\/>We are taught that suffering is a natural part of life. In essence, no pain no gain. That we have to go through emotional ups and downs, pain and pleasure.\u00a0 In most cases when adversities befall those who have tried to live a righteous life we are told that God will right the wrong done in his own time. Yet, we are never told the entire truth; that pain and pleasure are emotional states that can be triggered at will.\u00a0 We simply, as a society, are ignorant of the fact that we, not some outside entity, have the ability to remove any physical or emotional pain troubling us. And also, that if needed we can summon such pleasure that it surpasses that of any drug.\u00a0 These are techniques that can be learned by anyone!<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s look at the implications here so we can see a real picture of how society has screwed up our thinking and belief system:<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A young man becomes addicted to drugs. His addiction causes him to lose his job, friends and the love of family members. He takes to stealing to support his habit. The urge for cocaine is so strong that he simply cannot resist it. In our society he is labeled a drug addict and ostracized. If he is lucky and not arrested for carrying the drugs he may go into a good and expensive treatment center, where they will talk him through a 12 step program.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A young woman suffers from poor grades in school. She tries just as hard as everyone else but can\u2019t seem to keep up. Many of the subjects she studies are very intense such as biomechanics requiring many hours of study and research. She fails her final term paper and is forced to repeat the class. If she decides to seek help they will assign her a study buddy who will spend countless hours with her in the library coaching her through the dense material.\u00a0 Her career is on the line and she must somehow pass this class while not neglecting her other classes.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A young man is motivated to start his own business. So he pays thousands of dollars to attend motivational seminars, business lectures and purchases all kinds of at-home programs on how to get rich. Yet, hard as he tries each business is a dismal failure.\u00a0 He becomes more and more disenchanted. He watches TV or the internet and sees the success others are having and comes to the conclusion that he is just a failure in life. \u00a0Once more he dreams of meeting big investors who will fund his business. But he knows he has no such contacts in his Rolodex. He gets a regular 9 to 5 and calls it a life.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A man is physically abusive to his wife and daughter. He seeks help to manage his temper and the psychologist traces it back to when he was a child. They discover that he was physically abused by his father and neglected by his mother. In fact, as a child he was sent to the hospital a number of times for broken bones and open wounds inflicted by the violence. The psychologist uses talk therapy to help him realize the origin and resolution to his difficulties. But the man still has occasions or bouts of anger so he takes it one day at a time.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A violin player finds herself spending countless hours and thousands of dollars on training. She enjoys the music and the instrument. Through the tried and true practice of repetition she practices the same songs and notes over and over again until she has blisters on her fingers. She even forks over her life savings to hire one of the best violin coaches in the country. She dreams of being in the London Symphony Orchestra or perhaps being solo as a world-renowned player. But she knows full well that it may take years for her to get to master the instrument. And worse, she may discover that she just doesn\u2019t have the talent for it and will have to make a decision to move on with her life. She fears being a housewife or working for corporate America. But the truth is the odds are not in her favor given the current paradigm of society and its failure on how to teach people to awaken their inborn talents.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 An aspiring actress looking for her big break attends casting call after casting call but doesn\u2019t land that big role. She pays for acting classes and attends seminars on how to make it in Hollywood. She even moves to California and gets a job as a waitress so that she can have flexible hours and attend her auditions.\u00a0 But the years pass and yet still no roles. Even worse with each audition she attends she is told she is not the right type. She is too old, too fat, too skinny, too short, too tall, too blonde, too ethnic looking, etc. All of this rejection takes a toll on her mindset. Where she was once a positive individual with hopes of movie fame she now realizes that success in acting eludes her. She gives up and gets a regular job, family and settles down to a normal life.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 An attractive woman is plagued by relationship issues. She dates different guys looking for her soul mate but there seems to be no chemistry with these men.\u00a0 Even worse, the guys are jerks, self centered and egotistical. She desires someone to compliment her and daydreams of the perfect mate and children. She realizes that her clock is ticking but there seems to be little that she can do. The club and bar scene is unrewarding as it only results in guys looking for one night stands. So too is the internet. She tries dating sites but the guys hype up their profile and are just looking for one thing. She has even prayed to God to help find her a good man but to no avail. She ends up becoming bitter and disenchanted. Finally, she adopts the belief that love is a myth.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A martial artist puts in hundred of hours of practice. She loves to spar and often travels the country competing in competitions. But she has reached a plateau and can\u2019t seem to advance to the next level.\u00a0 So she increases her efforts but can\u2019t seem to perfect her kicks or her form. She looks around at other martial artists who perform their fights with ease, never forgetting one step. She notes that they are bigger and stronger than her and wonders if she\u2019ll ever be at their skill level. She knows in her heart she has the fire of a lioness but something is holding her back.\u00a0 Her 5th degree instructor just yells at her telling her to push, push, push! But the more she pushes herself the fewer results she sees. So she resigns herself to the fact that she just doesn\u2019t have the natural ability that other martial artists possess.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 A young woman finds herself in a terrible position. Everything she eats no matter how little increases her weight. She looks in the mirror and realizes she is severely overweight. However, she can\u2019t stop eating. So in an attempt to handle the situation she tries several fad diets. At first she loses some weight, which makes her feel good. However, in almost no time she regains the weight again and her self-image and self-confidence plummet. Even worse she realizes that when she goes out with her girlfriends guys no longer approach her. She tries diet pills but they don\u2019t work either. Finally, she takes out a gym membership but finds it hard to make the time to go to the gym after work. She knows that being overweight is a health risk but she feels there is nothing she can do. She wants to accept the notion that big is beautiful and accept her full-figured self. However, she often spends Friday and Saturday night at home in deep depression.<\/p> <p>As you can clearly see all of the case studies above have two things in common: the reliance on verbal communication to get a person to change his or her behavior, and the dependence on physical means to address their problems. If one were to examine the statistics we would see that such treatments are a dismal failure. But then one may ask why is it that some people have effectively quit smoking, shed weight or stopped drinking? Is this not proof that verbal talk does work?\u00a0 No, this is because the emotion and desire to change in those individuals penetrated the conscious mind and tapped directly into the subconscious mind effecting true change thus manifesting their desires.\u00a0 But not everyone has the knowledge to be able to do this nor are people aware enough to be able to reproduce the formula or effects. In religious circles this change is often mislabeled as being born again or God saved me. In secular circles it is attributed to a person\u2019s own drive to change all the while never realizing that the change came after they bypassed the conscious mind to communicate and commanded the subconscious mind to make the radical transformation.\u00a0 What folks failed to realize is that the power was always within them and the reliance on outside entities such as pills, gurus and books only served to make things more difficult.<\/p> <p>Now what I am advocating here is by no means a quick fix. But it is a lot easier than spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars trying to overcome a bad habit, emotional issue or learn something new. What we teach is so powerfully effective that you will notice the results overnight. We\u2019re talking about giving you not only the ability to overcome what is currently challenging you but to empower you with the ability to succeed in any aspect of your life.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/9\/6\/600_439796982.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>YOU\u2019LL HAVE THE POWER<\/p> <p><br\/>And do not forget that the net result of your efforts is not just the impregnation of information but the ability to tap into an awesome power that can align the forces of physical reality at your command. This is God\u2019s true blessing and the reason why you don\u2019t have to continually beg him for the things you need in life. He has given you the power to get them and more. Imagine if you will having the power to reshape the world to give you the things you need.

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun!

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>. \u00a0Everyone will read verses together from the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. \u00a0Atma and Subhie will together explain the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for almost fifty years, combined.\u00a0 We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p> <p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i> with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C.

In an increasingly urban life experience, archetypes take on new forms. Philip Williamston took on the task of searching and representing these new faces of archetypes.\u00a0<\/p> <p>A graphic artist from the Pratt Institute, he shares his artistic work and called it URBAN ARCHETYPES. It comes in the form of a 82-card suite. These cards can connect more instantaneously to urban dwellers, as he assigns new faces to The Empress, the Magician, the Hermit etc. His work ushers the archetypes directly to the experience they represent. Philip Williamston will be sharing his work with the Mythological Roundtable Community.\u00a0<\/p> <p>These visionary cards are a fountain of insight for those interested in the Tarot and archetypes in general. In his words:\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><i>\u201c\u2026My family felt the effects of [ the artistic and cultural struggle against racism and repression that began at the end the Civil War]. When my father survived an attempted lynching in North Carolina and in 1948 we migrated to New York City. Since I was very young, I was drawn to the study of the Arts and I have followed that calling through Pratt Institute, the CBS Network and Columbia University.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

It gives you a glimpse into what you can expect to see in the underwater world as well as what you could expect to learn in the Scuba Diver Course. You will be shown the basic safety procedures for scuba diving under the watchful eye of an instructor. You will learn skills like equalizing your ears, buddy checks, basic buoyancy control, underwater communication and an introduction to basic scuba equipment and scuba skills followed by an underwater dive in the pool.

Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Internationally recognized as a premier museum and research center, the Frick is known for its distinguished Old Master paintings and outstanding examples of European sculpture and decorative arts.<\/p> <p>The collection was assembled by the Pittsburgh industrialist Henry Clay Frick (1849\u20131919) and is housed in his former residence on Fifth Avenue. One of New York City\u2019s few remaining Gilded Age mansions, it provides a tranquil environment for visitors to experience masterpieces by artists such as Bellini, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Gainsborough, Goya, and Whistler. The museum opened in 1935 and has continued to acquire works of art since Mr. Frick\u2019s death.<\/p> <p>Adjacent to the museum is the Frick Art Reference Library, founded in 1920 by Helen Clay Frick as a memorial to her father. Today it is one of the leading institutions for research in the fields of art history and collecting.<\/p> <p>Along with special exhibitions and an acclaimed concert series, the Frick offers a wide range of lectures, symposia, and education programs that foster a deeper appreciation of its permanent collection.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/enfilade18thc.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/thumb-php.jpeg?w=720\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/enfilade18thc.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/thumb-php.jpeg?w=720<\/a><\/p> <p>ATTRACTIONS:<\/p> <p>\u2022 West Gallery<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.broketourist.net\/wp-content\/gallery\/the-frick-collection\/thefrick_03.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Garden Court<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/ishtodo.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/11\/the-frick-collection.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Backyard<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/sphong13.weebly.com\/uploads\/2\/5\/1\/6\/25169531\/538585_orig.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0East Gallery<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/img1.10bestmedia.com\/Images\/Photos\/224572\/frick-collection_54_990x660_201406010047.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Grand Staircase<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.toledoblade.com\/image\/2014\/11\/29\/800x_b1_cCM_z_cTL\/Staircase-2010-view-from-landing.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>REFERENCE LINK:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/frick-collection-new-york\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/frick-collection-new-york\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/frick-collection-new-york<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.frick.org\/visit\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.frick.org\/visit\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.frick.org\/visit<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>DISCLAIMER:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>END<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Contact 718-885-7688, We are either inside or online to get inside","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/events\/224396692\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Pay as you wish @ Frick Collection Museum","id":"224396692","time":1439737200000,"updated":1439746381000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1421303761000,"name":"NYC Asian Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18338455,"urlname":"NYCAsianMeetup","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Asians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10019","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"USS Maine Monument","name":"USS Maine Monument New York, NY","lon":-73.98114,"id":10140482,"state":"NY","lat":40.768246,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.34580039978,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1400413785000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This run will be\u00a0<b>beginner-friendly<\/b>, but we welcome runners at all levels.

But Tenniel was dissatisfied with the printing quality, and the edition was suppressed almost immediately. <b>Now, only twenty-two or twenty-three copies of the first edition are known to survive.<\/b> It was quickly republished, and Tenniel's brilliant drawings (markedly different from Carroll's own) and their relationship to the text contributed to the initial and enduring success of the book.\u00a0From here, the ethos of\u00a0Alice\u00a0and the universe of Wonderland took hold of our imagination, and\u2014150 years later\u2014we are still following her down the rabbit hole.\"<\/p> <p>After we see the exhibit,<b>let's check out the special tea being served in the cafe, in honor of the Mad Tea Party! <\/b>Here's the link to that:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.themorgan.org\/sites\/default\/files\/menus\/MorganCafeBrunch1.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.themorgan.org\/sites\/default\/files\/menus\/MorganCafeBrunch1.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.themorgan.org\/sites\/default\/files\/menus\/MorganCafeBrunch1.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Admission and How to meet us: <\/b>\u00a0General admission to The Morgan is $18, students and seniors $12.\u00a0\u00a0We're meeting in the lobby at 11:30am.

It will answer questions in great detail such as how Jesus lived and what He wanted us to know and do, what life after passing from this world will be like for us all, the structure and divisions of the angels, cutting edge scientific data and much, much more! The admission for all of these study group meetings will be FREE thanks to the generous contribution of The Urantia Society of Greater New York.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"6th Floor, Room 608, Building Bet 5th and 6th Aves, South side of 18th St","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Urantia-Book-Study-Group\/events\/224576439\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"Urantia Midtown NYC Study Group","id":"224576439","time":1439739900000,"updated":1439748432000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1235737982000,"name":"Urantia Midtown NYC Study Group","group_lon":-74,"id":1394455,"urlname":"Urantia-Book-Study-Group","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Spiritual People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"Cit Field (NY Mets) Flushing","name":"Citi-Field","lon":-73.826897,"id":23933369,"state":"NY","lat":40.8619,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.5357952118,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1435655234000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Male ages: all<br\/>Female ages: all<\/p> <p>Location:\u00a0Citi-Field<br\/>Cit Field (NY Mets)<br\/>Flushing, NY 11354<\/p> <p>Cost:\u00a0$45.75<\/p> <p>Description:<\/p> <p>\n\n\nTHIS EVENT IS OPEN TO ALL AND IS NOT MEANT TO BE AGE SPECIFIC OR GENDER BALANCED.

It is a form that covers every possible defense and counter attack we might find in a real confrontation, and trains our subconscious to react properly in such situations. It also strengthens our muscles, sinews and joints in order to be healthy to defend our life. The series of intricate and specific movements also trains the practitioner in the usage of the correct muscles to strike and to perform fajing (explosive energy). Needless to say, like any other training method in the system, it also improves our self-healing and our ability to heal others, by combining forcefully our mind\u2019s intent with our qi, and teach them how to work together. This is a form that was developed by Yang Shouzhong, Yang Cheng-fu\u2019s eldest son, in order to bring back the Yang energy element stripped in the simplifications made by his father to the original form.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nNote:<\/p> <p>These series of free classes are intended to show the both sides of the original Yang style: the \u2018softer\u2019 and internal, and the \u2018harder\/martial\u2019 and external. It will also elucidate the link between the both sides of the same coin - fajing. On one side, we train it slowly, in order to train the subconscious on how to recover that natural expression of energy, and to impart it with some sophistication that makes it more suitable for our higher-goals: self-healing and medical (healing others) work. On the other, we train on how to use it for self-defense purposes, and on how it can help give us the best chance of survival when our life is in true danger.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Contact info: 646-820-8653","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/WTBANYC\/events\/224226141\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":3600000,"name":"FREE LESSONS Small San Sau Self-Defense Form","id":"fljnjlytlbvb","time":1439740800000,"updated":1439746404000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1401724195000,"name":"World Taiji Boxing Association - New York City","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":14829442,"urlname":"WTBANYC","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"73 Eighth Avenue (Between 13th and 14th Streets)","name":"Think Coffee","lon":-73.982567,"id":15199002,"state":"NY","lat":40.731339,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":6,"headcount":0,"distance":1.34967446327,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439236372000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"par personne","currency":"USD","label":"Tarifs","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>LEVEL: INTERMEDIATE<\/p> <p>collective conversation: $10\/person -- Sunday 12-1pm -- (RSVP required)\u00a0<\/p> <p>A bient\u00f4t!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Rafa\u00ebl Leloup.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2014\u00a0seats are limited, please do not sign up if you can't come\u00a0\u2014<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/FrenchConversationGroup\/events\/224541591\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":3600000,"name":"French Conversation (INTERMEDIATE) - $10\/p","id":"224541591","time":1439740800000,"updated":1439752936000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1374351381000,"name":"French Conversation Group","group_lon":-74,"id":9441202,"urlname":"FrenchConversationGroup","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Francophiles"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11237","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"135 Thames St.","name":"La Luz","lon":-73.927383,"id":12154822,"state":"NY","lat":40.70583,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.48819828033,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1381428711000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Every Sunday, an open level dance class combining elements of jazz, cabaret and theater.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last!

We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p><b>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/223457120\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Morningside Park","id":"gjrzflytlbvb","time":1439740800000,"updated":1439754122000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"125th Street","name":"Harlem Week Street Fair","lon":-73.842957,"id":23960234,"state":"NY","lat":40.786724,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.11844062805,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1436756727000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Can you add an hour or two of community organizing to your summer schedule?

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>NEW Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>_______________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. So, at the very least give us\u00a03 days notice\u00a0that you will not be able to attend or in case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up past the 3 days notice, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a wait list, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels within the 3 days before the shoot, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\". Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at [masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/224470903\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":10800000,"name":"Bikini and Lingerie Shoot w\/Lily & Marissa - Aug. 16","id":"224470903","time":1439744400000,"updated":1439779072000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"292 Graham Ave","name":"Action Burger","lon":-73.944008,"id":22635272,"lat":40.712231,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.55804038048,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438334459000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Super Smash bros (WII U) on Sundays at Action Burger. \u00a0Bring your friends, bring your custom controller, eat some good food and have some fun on a Sunday afternoon in Williamsburg Brooklyn.\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/Q_4eQZepbPk\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/Q_4eQZepbPk<\/a><\/p> <p>Drinks and food specials:\u00a0<\/p> <p>3 shots for $5 ((Rum, Tequila, Vodka, Scotch).<\/p> <p>32oz rum and coke $10.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buy a beer, get a free shot.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Cheese Burger fries &amp; Soda $8.

As the days go on, a tenuous yet intense relationship seems to develop between journalist and subject. The two men bob and weave around each other, sharing laughs and also possibly revealing hidden frailties - but it's never clear how truthful they are being with each other. Ironically, the interview was never published, and five days of audio tapes were packed away in Lipsky's closet. The two men did not meet again. The film is based on Lipsky's critically acclaimed memoir about this unforgettable encounter, Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself: A Road Trip with David Foster Wallace, written following Wallace's 2008 suicide.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Cast:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/celebrity\/jesse-eisenberg\/2048299\/main\">Jesse Eisenberg\u00a0<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/celebrity\/jason-segel\/1980621\/main\">Jason Segel\u00a0<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/celebrity\/becky-ann-baker\/1143428\/main\">Becky Ann Baker\u00a0<\/a>,<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/celebrity\/anna-chlumsky\/1783843\/main\">Anna Chlumsky\u00a0<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/celebrity\/joan-cusack\/1786872\/main\">Joan Cusack\u00a0<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/celebrity\/mamie-gummer\/494693\/main\">Mamie Gummer\u00a0<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/celebrity\/ron-livingston\/1258528\/main\">Ron Livingston\u00a0<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/celebrity\/mickey-sumner\/10097466\/main\">Mickey Sumner<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>REVIEWS<\/b><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/publication\/tampa-bay-times?filter=movies\">Tampa Bay Times<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/critic\/steve-persall?filter=movies\">Steve Persall<\/a>Aug 11,[masked]The End of the Tour asks viewers to lean in, listen well and be rewarded with an uncommonly intelligent and relatable movie experience.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/critic\/steve-persall?filter=movies\">All this critic's reviews<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tampabay.com\/things-to-do\/movies\/review-the-end-of-the-tour-begins-jason-segels-road-trip-to-award-season\/2240743\">Read full review<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/publication\/washington-post?filter=movies\">Washington Post<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/critic\/ann-hornaday?filter=movies\">Ann Hornaday<\/a>Aug 6,[masked]Improbably, The End of the Tour doesn\u2019t just sustain the audience\u2019s interest in Wallace and Lipsky\u2019s exchanges, arguments and moments of bonding, but invites us to care deeply about the men.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/critic\/ann-hornaday?filter=movies\">All this critic's reviews<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/goingoutguide\/movies\/the-end-of-the-tour-a-five-day-conversation-you-wont-want-to-end\/2015\/08\/05\/f1c75fce-3b78-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html\">Read full review<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/publication\/chicago-sun-times?filter=movies\">Chicago Sun-Times<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/critic\/richard-roeper?filter=movies\">Richard Roeper<\/a>Aug 6,[masked]It\u2019s a brilliant slice of life.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/critic\/richard-roeper?filter=movies\">All this critic's reviews<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/entertainment.suntimes.com\/movies\/end-tour-infinitely-impressed-jason-segel\/\">Read full review<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/bttrack.com\/Click\/Native?data=OuJifVtEKZqw3Cw4fxrtW7OSHqsTMgHvlohCnQGjiuUkPAWAOsqmLhj4O8QdoN7q9Ra9j8MJP3K0CPWHqL-3mmICH5PIFPlDFm780c1tXL3pbTMzelo95-P1Ueq_B3bPWVVpT9ZHxcjarf4Oot9oHxrX8Ka6ChUlDylUeEDUNJ5LEtFBkLcxEW8rMuuvTAPrlxOr0OJt-12mjGD-2iytt2TFZ4WpIkmyd8bPlfNizkM-hX1_-aSz6Mw81RjrJWaRS87rI9mNJwwvcq0FoLwmDz5lV8omSINgzdL7c2UT2fIoUH81\">Get a FiOS package that's made for streaming.Equip your apartment with FiOS QuantumSM 50\/50 Mbps Internet, FiOS TV Local &amp; your choice of HBO\u00ae or SHOWTIME\u00ae for 2 yrs. with No Annual Contract.Sponsored by Verizon FiOS<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/publication\/new-york-magazine-vulture?filter=movies\">New York Magazine (Vulture)<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/critic\/david-edelstein?filter=movies\">David Edelstein<\/a>Jul 31,[masked]At times the movie\u2019s small canvas feels momentous.

The people in the audience are informed and enlightened and ask amazing questions that many DNNY members also had questions about. You can also read his bio and watch his videos on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simonparkes.wix.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simonparkes.wix.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.simonparkes.wix.com<\/a><\/a> .<br\/>His story is quite frankly amazing. He comes from and illuminati family and from earliest childhood has been in frequent contact with Mantids, Draconis Reptilians and many other beings to the point that he was actually raised by them, particularly the Mantids, as well as by his earth Mom. She was actually supportive of him. When he was old enough to tell her about his experiences, she told him to \u201cjust draw me pictures and I\u2019ll show them to my friends\u201d, which he did and, consequently, Simon has an amazing collection of drawings by his own hand that are actually quite wonderful to see when he tells his story.<br\/>Simon\u2019s mother worked for MI5 but was actually doing work from home (so she could be home to raise her son) for the NSA, typing documents that related to crashed UFO craft that had come down all over the Earth's surface and had then been retrieved by American special forces\/recovery teams.<\/p> <p>Her father, Simon\u2019s grandfather, was a British diplomat and spy working for MI6, which work was closely associated with the CIA.\u00a0During this time he was awarded the Order of the British empire (OBE) medal as well as the Commander of the British Empire (CBE) medal, however he turned down a Knighthood from the Queen. Simon's Grandfather was also a prominent Freemason and was Britain's appointed diplomat to the United Nations in the late 1950's and early 1960\u2019s<br\/>Simon was elected to political office as council member for the town of Whitby, UK after he revealed his story, despite the attempts of the media to discredit him. He is currently taking a break from public office to attend to the work he does through his website and speaking engagements. Much of the work he is doing is to establish a worldwide net work of people who can help with the coming changes which he calls \u201c Connecting Consciousness\u201d. He has an internet radio program by that name on Wolf Spirit Radio, which you can find on his website. He is likely to return to public office later this year.<\/p> <p><br\/>Simon has assisted a growing number of people who have come forward from Illuminati families\/bloodlines - where they have suffered torture and trauma, many from MILAB situations. Simon is able to re-integrate any alternate personalities that the individual may have, remove any Jinn\/demonic possession and \"de-activate\" any suicide programs placed in the person.<br\/>On a lighter note Simon also does Soul readings, where in most cases is able to identify the individuals soul\/star family background. This can help a person understand themselves better and also help them understand how they can be of help with the coming changes. A reasonable fee is charged for these services - Simon is offering a nearly unique service and places the highest value on client confidentiality - having helped people from many countries and from widely differing backgrounds, from college students to employees of the Rothschild's. Simon understands the critical nature of his deprogramming\/healing\/soul reading work and the support that his clients need.<\/p> <p>Simon\u2019s website is not yet taking appointments. He had got an amazing number of requests for sessions and then his website was attacked and his volunteer staff suffered scalar attacks. Most of his interviews are available on his website and provide a great deal of back up to David WIlcock, Corey Goode, David Icke, Tolec and many others.<\/p> <p>Note: Elaine will provide an auxiliary cable that can accommodate 4 to 5 personal headphones for people who had difficulty hearing at her last presentation.<\/p> <p>Please plan to attend what is bound to be one of the most interesting DNNY meetings to date and invite your interested friends to join us!<\/p> <p><b>Meeting Details:<\/b><\/p> <p>Admission: $10 per person.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested.

(See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers.

But Mr Boubacar wants out. \u201cNo matter how hard I work, I\u2019m doomed. My father did not have a regular salary, I don\u2019t, nor will my children.\u201d No job lasts longer than a few months, no place in school is assured, no gain is safe from theft. Economic anxiety is mixed with fear of political violence. Half of Mali fell to Islamic extremists three years ago. A French-led intervention pushed them back, but no peace deal has been signed, and terror attacks remain common. And Mali is far from the only country in the region to be threatened by political instability... The forces that move a man to economic migration today could make him a refugee tomorrow.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>And all the time pictures of seemingly attainable prosperity glisten on the television screen in the back of Mr Boubacar\u2019s caf\u00e9.

wines.\u00a0 Let\u2019s try some reds from Umbria.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Landlocked Umbria, the only Italian wine region with neither a coastline nor an international border, is often overshadowed by its more celebrated neighbor to the west, Tuscany.\u00a0 It\u2019s long been associated with the easy, uncomplicated whites of Orvieto, based on the workhorse Trebbiano grape (here called Procanico) and the more aromatic Grechetto.\u00a0 Indeed, Orvieto still accounts for 80% of Umbria\u2019s DOC production.\u00a0<\/p> <p>But Umbria\u2019s red wines are getting greater attention, thanks to new investment in the region and the influence of consulting oenologists.\u00a0 Sangiovese is the principal red grape, with increasing plantings of Bordeaux varietals, used in blends in the manner of Supertuscan wines.<\/p> <p>If Umbria has its own distinctive, signature grape, it\u2019s Sagrantino.\u00a0 It\u2019s an ancient variety found exclusively in Umbria, particularly around the hilltop town of Montefalco.\u00a0 It was cultivated by Franciscan friars and was long used for sweet <i>passito<\/i> wines, which are made from grapes that are dried to concentrate their sugars.\u00a0 After years of declining production, Sagrantino has enjoyed a revival since the 1980s, increasingly used to make powerful, dry red wines.<\/p> <p>Sagrantino is a thick-skinned, late-ripening varietal that is thought to have the highest concentration of tannins of any wine grape.\u00a0 It produces robust, long-lived wines with a dense concentration of tarry, black fruit flavors.\u00a0 In Rosso di Montefalco wines, the Sagrantino is tempered by blending with Sangiovese, and sometimes Cabernet or Merlot, resulting in an accessible wine suitable for early drinking.\u00a0 Sagrantino di Montefalco DOCG wines, on the other hand, are required to be at least 95% Sagrantino, with 30 months of aging before release (at least 12 months in oak barrel).\u00a0 These are formidable, somewhat polarizing wines.\u00a0 Some drinkers find the tough tannins exhilarating, for others they are just too much.<\/p> <p>In this tasting we\u2019ll try two whites made in Umbria by famed Italian wine dynasty Antinori.\u00a0 First the San Giovanni della Sala Orvieto, made up of half Grechetto, a quarter Procanico, then some Pinot Blanc and Viognier to add some complexity.\u00a0 Then their big, Burgundian Cervaro della Sala, in which the barrel-fermented Chardonnay is softened with a bit of Grechetto.\u00a0 This is considered one of the great white wines of Italy.<\/p> <p>Then two Super-Umbrians\u2014a Cabernet\/Sangiovese\/Montepulciano blend that is the retirement project of a certain Italian sports-car maker.\u00a0 Then an excellent and unusual example of Cabernet Franc (blended with a bit of Montepulciano)\u2014it has the trademark Cab Franc minerality, but with greater ripeness and intensity than you\u2019d find in Chinon or Bourgueil.<\/p> <p>Then the big guns\u2014two wines by Montefalco pioneer Arnaldo Caprai, who is largely responsible for the Sagrantino revival in Umbria.\u00a0 First the Montefalco Rosso Riserva, in which Sangiovese is given extra backbone by a dose of Sagrantino, then his 100% Sagrantino Collepiano, aged two years in oak.\u00a0 Then another Montefalco Sagrantino by Antonelli from an older vintage, so we can see if a little extra time can tame the big tannins.<\/p> <p>Some of these wines were obtained on sale for substantially less than the standard retail prices, so this tasting represents an excellent value.<\/p> <p>For more on these

winemaker:<\/i>\u00a0 \u201c50% Grechetto, 25% Procanico, 25% Pinot Blanc and Viognier.\u00a0 Brilliant in color with greenish highlights. The nose expresses fruity notes, particularly peach, pineapple, and citrus fruit. The structure and the acidity fuse in perfect balance with a savory and vibrant aftertaste of fine length and persistence.\u201d<\/p> <p><b>2012 Antinori Cervaro della Sala\u00a0 $42<\/b><\/p> <p><i>James Suckling 96<\/i> \u2013 Extremely rich and attractive aromas of cooked apple, toasted oak, meringue and yogurt. Full-bodied, rich and round with a fabulous balance between acidity, toasted oak, coconut and dried fruit. Lovely apple tart and custard pie. A blend of Chardonnay and Grechetto. This is so beautiful now.<\/p> <p><b>2008 Arnaldo Caprai Montefalco Rosso Riserva\u00a0 $45<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 91<\/i> \u2013 The 2008 Montefalco Rosso Riserva, a blend of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Merlot is delicious. It is also the most overlooked wine in the Caprai range, as most of the focus here is on Sagrantino. Firm tannins support a core of expressive dark red cherries, earthiness, tobacco, smoke and licorice. Elements of rusticity will always remain, but there is no shortage of personality. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2023.<\/p> <p><i>Tanzer 90+<\/i> \u2013 Inky purple.\u00a0 Deep, refined aromas of smoky dark plum and ink complicated by botanical herbs (here the Sagrantino dominates).\u00a0 Very dense and rich but fresh too thanks to vibrant acidity, which lifts the deep black and red fruit flavors.\u00a0 Turns massively tannic towards the back on the long finish; this can certainly be cellared for a few more years.<\/p> <p><b>2009 Arnaldo Caprai Sagrantino di Montefalco Collepiano\u00a0 $26<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 93<\/i> \u2013 The 2009 Montefalco Sagrantino Collepiano offers a modern interpretation of a traditional wine once made by monks. The extra oak intensity leads to soft tones of chocolate, dark cherry, and spice. This wine ages in barrique for 22 months. Each producer finds his or her own way to tame the brutal tannins of Sagrantino. One way Marco does this is with oak. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2025.<\/p> <p><b>2007 Antonelli Sagrantino di Montefalco\u00a0 $20<\/b><\/p> <p><i>James Sucking 94 (2011 review) <\/i>\u2013Wow, what a wild nose, with freshly cut flowers, spices, and blueberries. Love this nose! Full bodied, with amazing fruit and balance. Amazing for the money. Best ever from here.<\/p> <p><i>James Suckling 95<\/i> \u2013 This is really something. I loved a few years ago but now it even more amazing. Full and velvety with superb fruit. It's soft and decadent with meat, berry and bark character. It goes on for minutes. Great wine. Reminds me of a great C\u00f4te R\u00f4tie.<\/p> <p><b>2010 Lamborghini Torami\u00a0 $19<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 92<\/i> \u2013 Another racy red, the 2010 Torami (50% Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese and Montepulciano) is a gorgeous wine with thick extraction and pretty fruit tones of black cherry, plum and dried blackberry. Softer notes of lavender or dried rose fill in the back, giving way to heavier aromas of chocolate and espresso as the wine aerates in the glass. Sweet oak tones and exotic spice complete the package. Drink: 2014-2022.<\/p> <p><b>2011 Tenuta Vitalonga Phiculle\u00a0 $20<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 90+<\/i> \u2013 Super dark and inky, the 2011 Phiculle exhibits a large frame and loads of plush blackberry and cassis syrup that wrap around the palate. The blend is 90% Cabernet Franc and 10% Montepulciano, aged 15 months in oak. The Maravalle family as crafted a huge a bold and impenetrable wine that will withstand more cellar aging. Drink: 2015-2022.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Gay-Mens-Wine-Dinner-Group\/events\/224219010\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Umbria","id":"224219010","time":1439762400000,"updated":1439834226000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1432265288000,"name":"NYC Gay Men's Wine Dinner Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18616490,"urlname":"NYC-Gay-Mens-Wine-Dinner-Group","group_lat":40.75,"who":"wine lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10013","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"52 Walker Street","address_2":"(Between Church & Broadway)","lon":-74.003242,"phone":"(212) 965-1701 ","name":"M1-5 Lounge","id":859510,"state":"NY","lat":40.719151,"repinned":false},"headcount":100,"distance":2.24617195129,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1436792358000,"fee":{"amount":25,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Speed dating is the fun new way for single men and women to meet. <\/b><\/p> <p><b>At our speed dating event, we expect around 50 men and 50 women ages 20s &amp; 30s.

INSANITY pushes the participants to new training heights, resulting in more calories burned, faster results and more efficient metabolism. This interval training is the pinnacle of cardio training. You don't have to be in extreme shape - levels of each exercise are provided.<br\/>Insanity's not your traditional interval workout. It replaces traditional moderate-intensity exercise with maximum-intensity exercise, and trades short intervals of intensity for short periods of rest. The secret? Long periods of explosive intensity. You\u2019ll do cardio and plyometric drills with intervals of strength, power, resistance, and core training. With Insanity, you can burn up to 1,000 calories in an hour.

When New York District Attorney Joab Banton had Mae West arrested and hauled in to Jefferson Market Police Court in a paddy wagon on February 9, 1927, the controversial Brooklyn entertainer made global headlines for the first time. The actress-writer also served time in Jefferson Market Jail. At her side, covering the trial for the New York Journal American, was Texas Guinan, Mae\u2019s friend and a frequent passenger in the paddy wagon herself.<\/p> <p>Though most Broadway headliners avoided negative publicity in the 1920s, these two diamond-draped divas flouted convention, defied the police, and became as well known for being handcuffed as for blazing their way onto marquees of the best theatres.

A woman of restless energy, Texas-born Texas Guinan moved to New York in 1907, where she rented a room for $2 a week at 72 Washington Square South, and later moved to 17 West 8th St., where she lived in an antique-filled duplex. In addition to furs, ropes of pearls, and other jewelry, she wore bracelets on each wrist with 567 diamonds each and owned a fancy armored car that once belonged to the king of Belgium. Texas often partied with Mae at her own speakeasies, introducing the Brooklyn bombshell to Owney Madden, George Raft, and other men who would become useful.<\/p> <p>This presentation will include rare vintage images showing the buildings and blocks around Washington Square as these two headline-makers saw them. Sites will include the Village speakeasies where Mae socialized and bent elbows with Texas Guinan, Walter Winchell, Jack Dempsey, George Raft, and Barney Gallant; significant theatres; the court rooms where Mae and Texas fought City Hall; and off-beat addresses that made an impact. Mae West\u2019s Jefferson Market Jail poetry will also be read.<\/p> <p>All programs are Free and Open to the Public. \u00a0Presented in the first floor Willa Cather Community Room.<\/p> <p>The speaker LindaAnn Loschiavo is a Greenwich Village historian and dramatist; her plays include\u00a0\u201cCourting Mae West: Sex, Censorship, and Secrets\u201d and \u201cDiamond Lil, Queen of the Bowery.\u201d<\/p> <p>FREE!\u00a0 Meet promptly at 6pm to get seats together and socialize (limited free refreshments will be provided; presentation begins ~6:30pm.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nypl.org\/events\/programs\/2015\/08\/17\/onstage-outlaws-mae-west-and-texas-guinan-during-lawless-prohibition-era\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nypl.org\/events\/programs\/2015\/08\/17\/onstage-outlaws-mae-west-and-texas-guinan-during-lawless-prohibition-era\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.nypl.org\/events\/programs\/2015\/08\/17\/onstage-outlaws-mae-west-and-texas-guinan-during-lawless-prohibition-era<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nyc-variety\/events\/224190990\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Onstage Outlaws: Mae West and Texas Guinan during the Lawless Prohibition Era","id":"224190990","time":1439848800000,"updated":1439866733000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1432751474000,"name":"VSL: Offbeat & Eclectic Events for Irreverent Eccentrics","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":18629748,"urlname":"nyc-variety","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Irreverent Eccentrics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11375","country":"us","city":"Forest Hills","address_1":"Address provided when you RSVP to The Tarot School at http:\/\/www.tarotschool.com, or call them at 800-804-2184.","address_2":"E & F line trains, Long Island Railway","lon":-73.85,"phone":"800-804-2184","name":"The Tarot School","id":23308992,"state":"NY","lat":40.72,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":17,"headcount":11,"distance":7.63257312775,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1435563404000,"fee":{"amount":20,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/0\/600_427921472.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/1\/4\/a\/600_427928522.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>MONDAY NIGHTS, TAROT SALON WITH THE TAROT SCHOOL<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Forest Hills, 6-9:30pm,\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>includes delicious light dinner and dessert!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>$20 Pre-register online or cash, check, card at the door\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>RSVP REQUIRED TO THE TAROT SCHOOL because\u00a0<\/b><b>space is limited!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>(also RSVP here at Meetup, please!)<\/b><\/p> <p><b>THERE IS ONLY ROOM FOR 15 PEOPLE!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>LOCATION PROVIDED WHEN YOU CONTACT THEM,<\/b><\/p> <p><b>at[masked] or \u00a0<\/b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tarotschool.com\/Classes.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tarotschool.com\/Classes.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.tarotschool.com\/Classes.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Every week, The Tarot School in Forest Hills offers a valuable, interactive Tarot class in the home of the founders, Ruth Ann &amp; Wald Amberstone.

He received an excellent education and a fine upbringing. From a very early age, he underwent mystical experiences which already indicated his exceptional destiny. For several years, he was the president of the New York Institute for Psychical Research, and was considered an authority in this field. In 1909, he made contact with the European leaders of the Rosicrucian Order. Having given proof of his integrity and of his knowledge in philosophical and esoteric matters, he was initiated in Toulouse, where he officially received the mission of reactivating the Order in America. Despite encountering numerous obstacles and difficulties, he carried out his mission well, and in conformity with the instructions that were given him by the Rosicrucians of France, he began to put into writing the Rosicrucian teachings. In order to demonstrate the traditional and authentic foundations of the Order, he made it known under the name, \"The Ancient and Mystical Order of the Rose Cross.\" In 1915 he was named Imperator, that is, the international leader. After having dedicated his entire life to the service of the Order, Harvey Spencer Lewis passed through transition on August 2, 1939.<\/p> <p>This work, which is dedicated to him, is presented so that you can discover his thoughts through his essays. Though written in the past century, their message is always fresh. They demonstrate the modern spirit and avant-garde nature of this great philosopher and humanist.<\/p> <p><b>All are Welcome!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/224382953\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Circle of Spiritual Inquiry - Master of the Rose Cross: Another Spring","id":"fpbtflytlbwb","time":1439850600000,"updated":1439862848000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Wood-Ridge","address_1":"231 Hackensack Street","name":"Wood-Ridge Memorial Library","lon":-74.081734,"id":17489872,"state":"NJ","lat":40.847866,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.30804920197,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437525289000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"how_to_find_us":"All the way up the stairs.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Park-Avenue-Toastmasters\/events\/224083288\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":6300000,"name":"Toastmasters Meeting","id":"224083288","time":1439850600000,"updated":1439858538000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1376070306000,"name":"Park Avenue Toastmasters","group_lon":-74.0899963379,"id":9736342,"urlname":"Park-Avenue-Toastmasters","group_lat":40.8499984741,"who":"Toastmasters and Guests"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10027","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"163 W 125th St","name":"Adam Clayton Blvd State Office Building Plaza","lon":-73.947243,"id":808144,"state":"NY","lat":40.80852,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.6302075386,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438211983000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Toastmasters-Meetup\/events\/224268996\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Harlem Toastmasters will meet on Monday, August 17, 2015 at 6:30PM.","id":"224268996","time":1439850600000,"updated":1439862829000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1409617412000,"name":"Harlem Toastmasters Meetup","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":16737912,"urlname":"New-York-Toastmasters-Meetup","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Toastmasters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":30,"headcount":0,"distance":2.62231636047,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":13,"created":1439255483000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Winner stays, guys!<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3XviR7esUvo\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3XviR7esUvo\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3XviR7esUvo<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\nAnd just in case anyone needs a refresher, some guidance from Coach Ted Lasso.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6KeG_i8CWE8\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6KeG_i8CWE8\" class=\"embedded\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6KeG_i8CWE8<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nNo refunds or credits will be offered.

I love that we get to watch the sunset after class, and to teach on the beach in my borough! I teach yoga to adults, elders, and incarcerated teens. I believe yoga is a privilege that should be accessible and affordable to all who wish to practice.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

Much higher level of meditation in group than I can achieve doing my own practice. I was very happy to find a meditation group that was focused on bringing together community members to practice meditation. Bodhi meditation is unique because they offer free sessions to the community. Nan is a wonderful teacher, and very compassionate person. You can sense that she has extensive experience in oriental medicine including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and energy healing,. Thank you Nan. \u201d Joe, Bodhi Meditation class Wednesday October 29, 2014\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"It's like looking into the eyes of Pure Love. I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for. Thank you, Lynn\" Bodhi Meditation Class Saturday March 14, 2014\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201c Very strong healing energy tonight. I got there feeling very tired. I had stomach pain all day, and during the first meditation of the evening it got a lot better. By the end I wasn't thinking about it at all. I left full of energy. \u201d Pam, Bodhi Meditation class November 22, 2013<\/p> <p>\u201c I didn't realize I would be reaping the benefits of Bodhi Med so quickly after attending only two classes. After my second class I felt even more relaxed. I have insomnia, but after the second session I fell asleep faster and deeper which has not happened for a long time. \u201d Dee, Bodhi Meditation class September 18, 2013<\/p> <p>It was enlightening!!! Every time I practice Bodhi meditation, it feels like my Chi increases more and more!
