Sign up for a github account. This will allow us to more easily share code and collaborate together. (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/github.com\/<\/a>)<\/p> <p><br\/>2. Make sure you can log in to our chat room with your github account. This is the place to ask questions. (<a href=\"https:\/\/gitter.im\/NYDSSG\/chat\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/gitter.im\/NYDSSG\/chat<\/a>)<\/p> <p><br\/>3. Join our <a href=\"https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/#!forum\/nydssg\">google mailing list<\/a>. This will allow you to access and contribute to the tutorial list that the group is working on. More importantly, this lets you team up with other students on tutorials that are interesting to you.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our goal is to create a friendly and productive environment where we can build skills together with fellow data scientists. It doesn't matter if you use Python, R, or Excel, have 2 years of experience or 2 days, everyone is welcome to join. But to make it worth your time, check out the tutorial list FIRST. Pair up in a group if you see something interesting. Otherwise, add a tutorial so that others can join you.

He received an excellent education and a fine upbringing. From a very early age, he underwent mystical experiences which already indicated his exceptional destiny. For several years, he was the president of the New York Institute for Psychical Research, and was considered an authority in this field. In 1909, he made contact with the European leaders of the Rosicrucian Order. Having given proof of his integrity and of his knowledge in philosophical and esoteric matters, he was initiated in Toulouse, where he officially received the mission of reactivating the Order in America. Despite encountering numerous obstacles and difficulties, he carried out his mission well, and in conformity with the instructions that were given him by the Rosicrucians of France, he began to put into writing the Rosicrucian teachings. In order to demonstrate the traditional and authentic foundations of the Order, he made it known under the name, \"The Ancient and Mystical Order of the Rose Cross.\" In 1915 he was named Imperator, that is, the international leader. After having dedicated his entire life to the service of the Order, Harvey Spencer Lewis passed through transition on August 2, 1939.<\/p> <p>This work, which is dedicated to him, is presented so that you can discover his thoughts through his essays. Though written in the past century, their message is always fresh. They demonstrate the modern spirit and avant-garde nature of this great philosopher and humanist.<\/p> <p><b>All are Welcome!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/224244234\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Circle of Spiritual Inquiry - Master of the Rose Cross: What is Karma?","id":"fpbtflytlbfb","time":1438641000000,"updated":1438654157000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Wood-Ridge","address_1":"231 Hackensack Street","name":"Wood-Ridge Memorial Library","lon":-74.081734,"id":17489872,"state":"NJ","lat":40.847866,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.30804920197,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1436233857000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"how_to_find_us":"All the way up the stairs.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Park-Avenue-Toastmasters\/events\/223753681\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":6300000,"name":"Toastmasters Meeting","id":"223753681","time":1438641000000,"updated":1438648774000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1376070306000,"name":"Park Avenue Toastmasters","group_lon":-74.0899963379,"id":9736342,"urlname":"Park-Avenue-Toastmasters","group_lat":40.8499984741,"who":"Toastmasters and Guests"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":30,"headcount":0,"distance":2.62231636047,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":6,"created":1438069634000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Winner stays, guys!<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3XviR7esUvo\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3XviR7esUvo\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3XviR7esUvo<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\nAnd just in case anyone needs a refresher, some guidance from Coach Ted Lasso.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6KeG_i8CWE8\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6KeG_i8CWE8\" class=\"embedded\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6KeG_i8CWE8<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nNo refunds or credits will be offered.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Beyond Faith is for the person who doesn't quite fit in with\u00a0the pack, a person whose ideals and beliefs do not jive with their\u00a0peers, family members, or loved ones. This can be a tough journey,\u00a0especially for those whose family and friends are unsupportive of\u00a0their doubts and lack of belief. Our group aims to create a safe space\u00a0of support, community, inclusiveness, and encouragement on this\u00a0journey away from Christianity and towards a reason-based worldview.\u00a0For some, just the idea of entertaining serious doubts about faith can\u00a0be dangerous and overwhelming, and Beyond Faith seeks to ease the\u00a0process and create a warm, welcoming and optimistic environment for\u00a0like-minded folks on the same path.<\/p> <p><br\/>Beyond Faith is open to any young people who identify as atheist,\u00a0agnostic, Humanist, or who are having doubts about Christianity. We\u00a0are open to any and all denominations of Christianity.\u00a0Beyond Faith is\u00a0a safe space for women, people of color, LGBTQ people, and those who\u00a0are differently-abled. Because of this, the facilitators and\u00a0participants of this group will be expected to keep member identities,\u00a0meeting locations, and content confidential to protect everyone\u00a0involved.<\/p> <p>In order to ensure the confidentiality and safety of our group members, please email [masked] with the following questionnaire for the location details.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>New Member Questionnaire:<\/b><br\/>In an effort to ensure all members of this group are respectful and\u00a0open to others, we ask that you fill out this short questionnaire so\u00a0the organizers can tailor the group to its members.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Whether you\u2019re seeking to move up in your organization, looking for a new job, thinking about making a career change, launching a new business, wanting to attract new clients, or looking to scale your social impact, in today\u2019s rapidly-changing, hyper competitive working world a strong and consistent personal brand is key to creating new opportunities for your career or business.<\/p> <p>The truth is we all have a personal brand. It is how we are perceived by others - our friends, colleagues, and the public. It is what people think about when they hear our name and what people say about when we are not in the room. The key question we need to ask is: do we take charge of our personal brand or do we leave it up to chance?<\/p> <p>Personal Branding with Purpose is not about learning how to \"create\" a personal brand. It's about learning how to live your personal brand by sharing your authentic self and communicating clearly the value you can provide others. Our passions, talents, and impact are unique gifts we can give to the world. By learning how to market these gifts through personal branding, you create not only career and business opportunities but also a greater capacity to make a difference in the lives of others and the planet.<\/p> <p>* Doors open at 6:45 PM, workshop starts at 7:00 PM sharp *<\/p> <p><b>WHAT YOU'LL LEARN\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0An understanding of personal branding- how you can leverage it to create new career and business opportunities as well as scale your impact<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Gain greater clarity about your passions, values, purpose, and career goals that serve as a foundation for an authentic personal brand<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Define your Big Idea - what you stand for - and integrate it with your unique knowledge and experience to communicate your brand value<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Identify your niche, target audience and articulate how you can help solve problems they have<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Assess and strategically build your online identity and presence|Develop strategies for maintaining and adapting your personal brand in a world of constant change<br\/>\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>WHO THIS CLASS IS FOR\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Professionals looking to create new career and business opportunities<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0People seeking a new job or looking to make a career shift<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Entrepreneurs wanting to increase their own visibility to grow their businesses<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Creatives and service providers (consultants, coaches, agents, and speakers) wanting to attract new clients and business opportunities<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Students or recent grads looking to build a foundation for their future career path<\/p> <p><b>INSTRUCTOR BIO<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.evbuc.com\/eventlogos\/1311863\/marcossalazarheadshot.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/marcossalazar.com\/\">Marcos Salazar<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/marcossalazar\">@marcossalazar<\/a>) <\/b>is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.besocialchange.com\/\">social entrepreneur<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/marcossalazar.com\/#services\">career + life coach<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marcossalazar.com\/consulting\">consultant<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/marcossalazar.com\/#engage\">speaker<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.besocialchange.com\/\">community builder<\/a>.

After about 10 minutes of meditation, we will share the inspirational guidance that we receive.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Aside from sharing the message that we receive from the Holy Spirit, we don't talk during this meetup event. We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

The meeting is NOT open to media.<\/p> <p>We'll meet in Teardrop Park in the Battery Park City area. Enter the park on the west side of North Avenue between Warren and Murray, and look for us with a sign. If you have trouble finding us, call Janet at (347) 724-6954. See the map for a better idea of where to enter. In case of rain, we'll meet in the Winter Garden atrium with the palm trees at Brookfield Place (formerly World Financial Center) at 200 Vesey Street.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/9\/4\/600_440357812.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Newcomers are always welcome and encouraged to attend our full meeting, but if you ONLY want an introduction to freeganism and to dumpster dive, DON'T sign up for this meeting! See the next one (Freeganism 101 and Trash Trailblaze, later the same evening).<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Teardrop Park in the Battery Park City area.

Bring a guest your first visit and your first class is 1\/2 off.<br\/>This revolutionary cardio-based total-body conditioning program is based on the principles of MAX interval training. INSANITY pushes the participants to new training heights, resulting in more calories burned, faster results and more efficient metabolism. This interval training is the pinnacle of cardio training. You don't have to be in extreme shape - levels of each exercise are provided.<br\/>Insanity's not your traditional interval workout. It replaces traditional moderate-intensity exercise with maximum-intensity exercise, and trades short intervals of intensity for short periods of rest. The secret? Long periods of explosive intensity. You\u2019ll do cardio and plyometric drills with intervals of strength, power, resistance, and core training. With Insanity, you can burn up to 1,000 calories in an hour. Participants experience faster increases in cardiovascular fitness and burn carbohydrates and fat more efficiently.<\/p> <p>Class Description:<br\/>PLYOMETRICS for insane legs and gluts, UPPER BODY RESISTANCE for sculpted arms, shoulders, chest, and back.

Thank you Nan. \u201d Joe, Bodhi Meditation class Wednesday October 29, 2014\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"It's like looking into the eyes of Pure Love. I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for.

Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside as a backup.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

When writers think about plot we focus on action and conflict to define it. But many writers concentrate so much on the protagonist's active goal they neglect the emotional side of the story. As a result characterizations suffer. Drama is as much about reaction, the repercussions of action, as it is about action. Plot is more than just an outline of events, it's the ordering of emotions to build your characters and strengthen their relationships. Learn to define the emotional pattern of plots for screenplays and teleplays.<\/p> <p>Film &amp; TV clips she will analyze include: <i>Breaking Bad, Spiderman, American Beauty, Jaws<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PRICE:\u00a0<\/b>$25 discounted to <b>$15<\/b> for NYCSC members.<\/p> <p><b>WHEN:\u00a0<\/b>Tuesday, August 4th\u00a06:30p-9pm \u00a0<\/p> <p>(Sold out crowd expected, event begins at 7pm, arrive early to claim your seat.)<\/p> <p><b>WHERE:<\/b> Adorama 42 W 18th St (bet 5th &amp; 6th Ave) New York, NY 10011<\/p> <p><b>LINDA COWGILL<\/b>\u00a0is an author of the books The Art of Plotting, Writing Short Films, and Secrets of Screenplay Structure, has written for film and television.

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't open our door from 6:30 - 7 pm while meditation is in progress. Kindly refrain from ringing our buzzer during this time.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/223953536\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjytlbgb","time":1438727400000,"updated":1438740695000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"447 Broadway, 2nd Floor","name":"Blueprint Health","lon":-73.951675,"id":23985294,"state":"NY","lat":40.706284,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.63372373581,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437696796000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Technology is changing health outcomes by facilitating patient involvement in all phases of treatment and, thus, creating a more patient-centered culture in the healthcare system.

In other words you have to find a way to get out of that 9-5 that we all dislike and step into the life you always wanted to live.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nHow do you get out of the race race you ask?<\/p> <p>Your total monthly passive income has to be higher than your total monthly expenses.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nCashflow 101 is an educational tool in board game format which aims to teach the players concepts of investing by having their money work for them in a risk free setting (play money) while simultaneously increasing financial\u00a0literacy and stressing the imperative nature of accountability.<\/p> <p><br\/>There are two stages to the game. In the first, \"the rat race\", the player aims to raise his or her character's passive income level to where it exceeds the character's expenses. The winner is determined in the second stage, \"the fast track\". To win, a player must get his or her character to buy their \"dream\" or accumulate an additional $50,000 in monthly cash flow.<\/p> <p>In place of \u201cscore cards\u201d, there are financial statements. The game requires the players to fill out their own financial statements so that they can see more clearly what is happening with their money. It generally shows how assets generate income and demonstrates that liabilities and 'doodads' are expenses.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NJR-Investment-Group\/events\/224145920\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":10800000,"name":"NY\/NJ Cash Flow game night","id":"rxwdglytlbgb","time":1438727400000,"updated":1438740180000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1350833487000,"name":"NJ\/NY Real Estate Investors & Entrepreneurs","group_lon":-74.0699996948,"id":5489542,"urlname":"NJR-Investment-Group","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Real Estate Investors"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New Rochelle","address_1":"5 Forest Place","name":"Ralph's house","lon":-73.789398,"id":21846052,"state":"NY","lat":40.931328,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":16.3708724976,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1421016816000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Single parents are invited to join Parents Without Partners Chapter #21 .

Let's continue talking and\u00a0freely\u00a0discussing these roots of our \"accent and pronunciation problems\u201d and see what we can do about them. They can be a source of pride in your heritage and identity, but still you may want to reduce them somewhat to be better understood in English. Let\u2019s take a look together, and find your comfort zone!<\/p> <p>In this and future sessions, we\u2019ll listen to individual people's concerns and problems with their own speech, and their difficulty in understanding others talking English. All who like will have an opportunity to speak and be open to the polite, good-natured responses of the group.<\/p> <p>Please come if you feel comfortable talking about your own speaking and accent problems and would enjoy the give and take \u00a0of the rest of the group about theirs. Tell us what you feel are your biggest concerns, what letters, combinations of sounds, whatever bothers you the most. If you come and decide not to take a turn speaking, that's cool too. There will be other occasions in the future when you may feel bolder to try.<\/p> <p>This is a work in progress and we\u2019ll change the format as we see how we do.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s tame some idioms AND some accents!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Taming-Idioms-and-Other-Wild-Animals-in-NYC\/events\/223955259\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"Taming Idioms and Accents and Other Wild Animals !!!","id":"qmzhzhytlbgb","time":1438729200000,"updated":1438738661000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1368157626000,"name":"Taming Idioms and Other Wild Animals in NYC","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":8423942,"urlname":"Taming-Idioms-and-Other-Wild-Animals-in-NYC","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Tamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1436981075000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/dragonballz.com\/index.php\"><a href=\"http:\/\/dragonballz.com\/index.php\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/dragonballz.com\/index.php<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/3\/d\/3\/600_439809171.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>DON'T MISS THIS\u00a0<br\/>LIMITED THEATRICAL EVENT<\/p> <p>AUGUST 4-12<\/p> <p>LIMITED THEATRICAL EVENT AUGUST 4-12<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/dragonballz.com\/images\/headerlogo.png\" \/><\/p> <p>Hot on the heels of last year\u2019s summer blockbuster, Battle of Gods, Dragon Ball Z is back in theaters.

He has long since accrued some interest in Rayne Waters, a bank employee who's too beautiful to be true -- and too beautiful to be single. At least that's what Yardley believes, which is why he has never approached her.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Little does he know that Rayne is anything but taken. Not for want of trying, of course. But after barely surviving a dating disaster with her hairdresser's brother and then falling for a member of her church band who, it turns out, is celibate, she's on the verge of giving up. That is, until Yardley -- discouraged by his own slew of dead-end romances -- finally works up the courage to give her a try.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The true craziness, however, is just beginning, thanks to a cast of characters who seem bent on botching the young couple's relationship.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>There's Rayne's erratic mother, who constantly boasts about being a \"good whore\"; Yardley's playboy buddies, always trolling for sex; and, worst of all, past lovers who make a habit of popping up and ruining things as only old flames (or previous mistakes) can. Weaving the carnal and the comical in true Zane fashion, Rayne and Yardley's struggle to find love in a world gone mad is a timeless talk about everything that can go wrong in the dating game -- and a few things that can go right.<\/i><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We are the loud laughing people in the back.

They do so much with the ninja theme that I really do believe they deserve five stars. We were a party of 6, and were situated in a little \"home\". I was genuinely surprise 4 or 5 times by our sneaky wait staff who would every now and again pop out from a sliding door, or throw flash paper into the room. Now, since this is a restaurant this review wouldn't be complete without an analysis of the food. The steaks are huge! Don't expect to finish the 17oz monster. Typically the bigger the steak the worse it tends to be, however, I found the steak was a good cut and actually cooked medium rare! Anyone that doesn't overlook my steak is fine by me.<\/p> <p><br\/>MENU:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ninjanewyork.com\/menu2.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ninjanewyork.com\/menu2.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ninjanewyork.com\/menu2.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>FOOD GALLERY:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Sushi Paradise<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/hndXwonKLOi8djKyMvv7Mw\/l.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Dragon Roll<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/i10Xby3PpsMer_2WDHHVpw\/l.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Strawberry Sunday<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/bVXTjeZ_F-cb1TQKL_CnvA\/l.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Shrimp Appetizer<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/kheSY2rjxpq5AyJtr5aHZA\/l.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>RESTAURANT GALLERY:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Front Door<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.livingthelist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/Ninja_NYC.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Dining Room 1<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/nicoleslist.files.wordpress.com\/2011\/05\/ninja-ny-2.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Dining Room 2<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.restaurantsinyc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/ninja.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Waitress asking for more\u00a0TIP!!!\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/imgs.ntd.tv\/content\/20100219-AB-12-Ninja-Themed%20Restaurant%20Opens%20in%20Taiwan.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Ninja Village<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kissfromtheworld.com\/en\/files\/whatsup\/2010_07_09\/7_ninja_restaurant_village_new_york_manhattan_usa_kiss_from_the_world_magazine_travel_and_people.JPG\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.kissfromtheworld.com\/en\/files\/whatsup\/2010_07_09\/7_ninja_restaurant_village_new_york_manhattan_usa_kiss_from_the_world_magazine_travel_and_people.JPG<\/a><\/p> <p>RESTAURANT REVIEW:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/ninja-new-york-new-york?sort_by=elites_desc\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/ninja-new-york-new-york?sort_by=elites_desc\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/ninja-new-york-new-york?sort_by=elites_desc<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>DISCLAIMER:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>END<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet us @ coordinates 40.716802, -74.009428","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/events\/223801574\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Dinner @ Ninja New York (japanese cuisine)","id":"223801574","time":1438729200000,"updated":1438802433000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1421303761000,"name":"NYC Asian Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18338455,"urlname":"NYCAsianMeetup","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Asians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10014","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"315 Bleecker Street","name":"Caudalie","lon":-74.003716,"id":11368782,"state":"NY","lat":40.732903,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.38532483578,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1436213527000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join the Dolls and Caudalie for a spa night with wine tasting!

It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts.

When writers think about plot we focus on action and conflict to define it. But many writers concentrate so much on the protagonist's active goal they neglect the emotional side of the story. As a result characterizations suffer. Drama is as much about reaction, the repercussions of action, as it is about action. Plot is more than just an outline of events, it's the ordering of emotions to build your characters and strengthen their relationships. Learn to define the emotional pattern of plots for screenplays and teleplays. Film &amp; TV examples to be reviewed: Breaking Bad, Spiderman, American Beauty, Jaws<\/p> <p>Linda Cowgill began her screenwriting career after completing her MFA at UCLA's School of Film and Television.\u00a0 Linda has written television and films for Paramount, Universal, MGM, Warner Bros., and several small independents.\u00a0 She has taught seminars and workshops at the American Film Institute, the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., the Boston Film Institute, Loyola Marymount University, IFP Miami and NALIP.

Whether plucking, strumming, bowing or \u201crocking out\u201d on this trad instrument. DK\u2019s music is at turns evocative, moving, playful, and fun, while always remaining genuine.<\/p> <p>DK is a NYC born, urban mountain dulcimer performer and singer-songwriter who plays both traditional \u201clap\u201d and \u201cNova Scotian\u201d style on four and five string dulcimers, holding the electric dulcimer like a guitar.<\/p> <p>A Mid-East Mountain Dulcimer champion, DK won first place on \u201cThe Joy Machine\u201d in the Great Trails Dulcimer contest in her 20s. Already an accomplished songwriter and composer, she adopted Irish tunes for dulcimer, playing in trad sessions and traditional Americana with Hank Halfhead and the Rambling Turkeys while living in Dublin for eight years.

Based on the book of the title (which has sold over 100 million copies in 40 languages since its publication in 1923), the film, opening August 7, intersperses Gibran\u2019s elegant poetry with stunning animated sequences by Tomm Moore (Song of the Sea), Nina Paley (Sita Sings the Blues), Bill Plympton (Guide Dog), and a host of other award-winning animators from around the world.<\/p> <p>Kahlil Gibran\u2019s The Prophet is set in a Mediterranean seaside village where Kamila (Hayek) cleans house for the exiled artist and poet Mustafa (Liam Neeson), but the more difficult job is keeping her free-spirited young daughter, Almitra (Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis), out of trouble. The trio embark on a journey meant to end with Mustafa\u2019s return home\u2014but first they must evade the authorities who fear that Mustafa\u2019s words will incite rebellion.<\/p> <p>Hayek is well known for her work in front of the camera with roles in Dogma, Desperado, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Savages, Wild Wild West, and Frida (which earned her an Oscar nomination) and small-screen appearances on 30 Rock and Ugly Betty. Hayek also works extensively behind the camera, where she has served as both director and producer (and as executive-producer of Ugly Betty). In 2003, Hayek produced and directed the Showtime film The Maldonado Miracle, for which she won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing in a Children\/Youth\/Family Special. Hayek will talk about her work both as an actress and a filmmaker.<\/p> <p><b>Free tickets will be distributed at the Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center box office (144 West 65th Street, between Broadway and Amsterdam) on a first-come, first-served basis starting one hour prior to the talks.

Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p><b>Do members need to bring anything?\u00a0<\/b><br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<\/b>\u00a0<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p><b>What should a newcomer expect?\u00a0<\/b><br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly. We have a colorful cast of characters from all walks of life who are ready and willing to have a good time.<\/p> <p>Whether you're interested in easy-going rallying or competitive play, we can accommodate you.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?\u00a0<\/b><br\/>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments; please send them to our head organizer, Frank Tirado via email.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bronxtennis\/events\/224427947\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":10800000,"name":"Impromptu Hump Day tennis @ Crotona Park","id":"224427947","time":1438812000000,"updated":1438825020000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335455062000,"name":"Bronx Tennis","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":3746792,"urlname":"bronxtennis","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Lodi","address_1":"Corabelle Avenue","name":"Memorial Par Amphiteater","lon":-74.091637,"id":23880083,"state":"NJ","lat":40.875111,"repinned":false},"headcount":10,"distance":10.1682138443,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1433445928000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us as we watch and hear ''Long Live The Beatles'' perform classic Beatles hits.

(With the subtle activist mission of promoting veganism by showing people how much fun it can be.) In recent years we've done an occasional event that was directly an activist event, but these have been few and far between.<\/p> <p>While we are, and will continue to be, mostly a social group, we'd like to step up the number of activist events we do.<\/p> <p><br\/>This August 5th event will be outreach to the general public to promote and encourage a vegan diet &amp; lifestyle. We will hand out literature in a welcoming manner so our audience will be open to seeing how great the benefits of veganism are.<\/p> <p><br\/>We will meet at the designated location in Union Square at 6:30 pm (please arrive on time!). After a brief discussion on strategy and positioning of people, along with a few reminders for the group, we'll leaflet from 6:45 pm to 7:45 pm. Then our group will reassemble at the designated location and walk over to a nearby, all-vegan restaurant to have dinner, discuss our experiences and thoughts, and socialize.<\/p> <p>We know that not everyone in our group is vegan, but on this day we will be promoting veganism. You are very welcome to join us even if you are not yet 100% vegan, but please understand that the literature we will hand out will promote a purely vegan lifestyle. Mostly on this day you will be handing out literature rather than talking to people, but if you do happen to speak with people, we are promoting a vegan diet and lifestyle.<\/p> <p><b>Where to meet:<\/b> We will be meeting at the extreme southwest corner of Union Square Park, <b>where Union Square West meets East 14th Street.

You may want to plan on being there early in order to be on time. Don't be late! We will talk for 15 minutes and then disburse to various nearby locations in the park.<\/p> <p><br\/>We believe that grass-roots activism is vital in advancing the ideal, practice, and potential normalization of veganism in our world.

The New York Chamber of Commerce was founded here in 1768, the Sons of Liberty planned the New York Tea Party here in 1774 and the New York Provincial Congress met here in 1776. The Colonial government's Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Treasury and Department of War were all housed here in the late 18th century.

The one-time subway busker was a founding member of The Prodigals but was best known as lead singer of his own band, The McCabes, which drew packed houses at Paddy Reilly's every week in the late '90s and early 2000s. Sean has since settled into life as a solo artist and author and currently resides in Sweden. One of his books, \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/15767783-the-pubs-of-new-york\">The Pubs of New York<\/a>\" is a fictional account, loosely based on his early adventures in the New York Irish pub rock scene. He'll be reading from his latest works, the novel \"Breakfast in Woodside\" and the book of poems, \"Lyrics 'n Ballads\". as well as playing some of his old McCabes classics and newer solo material. Should be a great night and we'll have the Bourbon Lounge to ourselves for this event. Meet up starting at 7 for drinks, food and conversation and to get a seat. Sean should start around 8.<\/p> <p>You may remember Sean from some fun summer meetups we did at Hurley's and O'Brien's 5-6 years ago. Even solo, he always puts on a great show.<\/p> <p><br\/>I'll be inviting the other meetup groups I organize for including Old New York Bars, New York Irish Pub Challenge, and Irish in New York.

By the end of this 8-week series, you will be equipped with all the necessary tools to make a seamless transition into the advanced level. *For those that register for Level 3, Levels 1 &amp; 2 are included as extra practice, free of charge, in your monthly package.*<\/p> <p>Sample Video: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rSHUoyjfxlA\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rSHUoyjfxlA\" class=\"embedded\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rSHUoyjfxlA<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>Location<\/b>:<\/p> <p><b>Adelante Studios<\/b><br\/>25 W 31st Street between Broadway and 5th Avenue<br\/>2nd Floor<br\/><b>Grand Ballroom<\/b><\/p> <p>Nearby Subways: 34th St Station on B, D, F, M, N, Q, R, &amp; PATH trains.<\/p> <p>*Can't find our room?

This month\u2019s session will be for all types of game devs using Unity, particularly in a team or studio setting.<br\/>Unity is fast becoming the tool of choice for teams large and small, from students to indies, and increasingly for studios creating larger commercial projects as well. But how does Unity scale? What are some of the issues and challenges faced by larger teams collaborating on projects? What pipeline and process issues have you encountered, and how have you worked around them? What do you love about Unity\u2026 and what do you wish you could change?<br\/>Featuring guests from local Unity studios including Muse Games, What Pumpkin Studios, Eppy Games, and more, this event will be a participatory, closed-door roundtable discussion among peers.
