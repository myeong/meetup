For example, we show up in Union Square with flowers that we give to random strangers on the street, with a smile and maybe a hug. Or we go to a poor area and randomly pick a person who's groceries we'll pay for. More ideas along those lines are appreciated! As you've understood, some spending of money may be part of some of our \"hits\" but we will keep it at a minimum. The opportunities for good-doing are endless and I would be greatful if you let me hear your ideas, especially ones that involves low-cost to no-cost spending since most of us are struggling financially ourselves.

You can also bring books to swap if you're running out of space.<\/p>\n<p>We also now have a Brooklyn chapter, which you can join at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Choose-Your-Own-Reading-Adventure-Brooklyn\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Choose-Your-Own-Reading-Adventure-Brooklyn\/<\/a>.<br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/2\/a\/highres_390268202.jpeg","photo_id":390268202,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/2\/a\/600_390268202.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/2\/a\/thumb_390268202.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":6828801,"name":"Karina Mikhli"},"members":96,"name":"Choose Your Own Reading Adventure: Manhattan Book Discussion","id":15932602,"state":"NY","urlname":"Choose-Your-Own-Reading-Adventure-Manhattan","category":{"name":"literature\/writing","id":18,"shortname":"literature-writing"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Readers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1406165649000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"daytraders","name":"Day Traders","id":2088},{"urlkey":"ibd","name":"Investor's Business Daily","id":2545},{"urlkey":"retirement","name":"Investing for Retirement","id":6364},{"urlkey":"forextrading","name":"Forex Trading","id":8431},{"urlkey":"futures-trading","name":"Futures Trading","id":16268},{"urlkey":"currency-trading","name":"Currency Trading","id":16269},{"urlkey":"technical-analysis","name":"Technical Analysis","id":17232},{"urlkey":"stock-trading","name":"Stock Trading","id":17234},{"urlkey":"stock-market","name":"Stock Market","id":19267},{"urlkey":"careers-in-forex-trading","name":"Careers in Forex Trading","id":19381},{"urlkey":"stock-investing","name":"Stock Investing","id":22016},{"urlkey":"trading","name":"Trading","id":26906},{"urlkey":"fx-trading","name":"FX Trading","id":95411}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nyctraders\/","rating":4,"description":"<p>80% of global wealth is owned by 0.8% of the global population.

We organize social skates and get-togethers in the city, trips around the eastern seaboard and farther afield, clinics, seminars, parties and promote skate advocacy. We provide discounts at skating stores, discounted subscriptions to skating magazines, and occasionally give our members free merchandise from our sponsors. For a full list of membership benefits, visit the membership page on our website.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Evening\/Night Skates are a great way to meet people. Our Tuesday Night Skate, New York's longest running night skate, is for more experienced skaters who want to experience all the thrills of skating in and around the five boroughs at night. We also always join the Wednesday Night Skate leaving every Wednesday at 8 pm from Union Square South. This skate is for intermediate skaters who are comfortable skating in traffic (And it's a blast!!!).\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Day Skates are longer trips, usually half to a full day long, to Coney Island, CT Beaches, Westchester Trails or along the Jersey Palisades (for example), and are for intermediate level skaters. Possible day-long skates might involve hopping aboard a commuter train and heading off to a skating place in nearby Westchester, Long Island or southwestern Connecticut. Our leaders are experienced skaters who have done these routes many times. Benefit from their experience and discover places you otherwise might never have thought about reaching on skates. It's fun and easy!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Skating Trips to other cities are weekend long trips providing the opportunity to skate, party &amp; socialize with hundreds of our skater friends from all around the country (and beyond) in Philadelphia, Boston, Washington DC, Miami and elsewhere. Our own version of this is The Big Apple Roll (BAR), usually the first weekend of August each year.

Vision To support the well being of veterans, service members, and their families in communities nationwide. Connected Warriors is a community based volunteer organization providing free, trauma-conscious yoga therapy for service members, veterans and their families in the United States. Connected Warriors was founded in August 2011 by a group of professionals and yoga teachers in the South Florida area who, as long time practitioners themselves, know the powerfully beneficial effects of this ancient system. Connected Warriors has established a nationwide network that includes 568 Certified Yoga Teachers who volunteer their time and talents to instruct classes at local yoga studios, community veteran centers and other donated spaces. As of July 2013, we conduct approximately 175 classes each month with an attendance of about 1,000 participants. Therapeutic yoga practices, including relaxation and meditation, are a valuable treatment component for post traumatic stress and other trauma-related psycho-emotional difficulties. Overseas deployments can affect service members, veterans and their families for years. Participants of our current classes learn how to handle stressful situations in a more relaxed manner by quieting and focusing their mind, which encourages positive thoughts and self-acceptance.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14195604,"name":"ConnectedWarriorsNYC"},"members":54,"name":"Free Yoga for Veterans & their families","id":16004522,"state":"NY","urlname":"ConnectedWarriorsNYC","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Connected Warrior"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cedar Grove","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1406477163000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"information-technology","name":"Information Technology","id":15568},{"urlkey":"low-voltage","name":"Low Voltage","id":1491492},{"urlkey":"installation-voice-and-data","name":"Installation voice and data","id":1491502}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/VDINNJ\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Anybody can join but this group is for installer of Voice\u00a0 Data and other low voltage networks<\/p>\n<p>Currently installers lack an Association whose main focus is to protect, train and educated their members like many others trade associations.

We advocate for preventive medicine, especially good nutrition, conduct clinical research, and advocate for higher ethical standards in research. Our membership includes 150,000 health care professionals and concerned citizens.\n\nWe encourage higher standards for ethics and effectiveness in research:\nWe oppose unethical human experiments. While great strides have been made in eliminating such experiments, problems remain. For example, children are still given synthetic growth hormone in experiments to make them taller, and both children and adults are exposed to unnecessary new drugs which have toxic effects.\n\nWe promote alternatives to animal research and animal testing. We have worked to put a stop to gruesome experiments, such as the military\u2019s cat-shooting studies, DEA narcotics experiments, and monkey self-mutilation projects. \n\nWe also promote nonanimal methods in medical education. Currently, more than three-quarters of all U.S. medical schools have dropped their animal labs for medical students.\n\nThe Physicians Committee has led the way for reforms of federal nutrition policies.  Our clinical research programs are breaking new ground in diabetes, cancer, and other serious conditions.  PCRM\u2019s Cancer Project has provided vital information to tens of thousands of people.\n\nThe New Four Food Groups is the Physicians Committee's innovative proposal for a federal nutrition policy that puts a new priority on health.\n\nOur public service announcement series features medical experts on prevention and health.\n\nThe Physicians Committee is a nonprofit 501c3 organization headquartered in Washington, D.C.","lon":-74,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":158713292,"name":"Kate Krone"},"members":7,"name":"PCRM Benefit & Auction with Dr. Neal Barnard in Amagansett","id":16031062,"state":"NY","urlname":"PCRM-Benefit-Auction-with-Dr-Neal-Barnard-in-Amagansett","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"PCRM Supporters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Yonkers","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1406578072000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"scrapbook","name":"Scrapbooking","id":211},{"urlkey":"jewelry","name":"Jewelry Making","id":746},{"urlkey":"cardmaking","name":"Card Making","id":6669},{"urlkey":"craftswap","name":"Crafts","id":10099},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"creativecircle","name":"Creative Circle","id":10447},{"urlkey":"handmade-crafts","name":"Handmade Crafts","id":16459},{"urlkey":"painting","name":"Painting","id":16784},{"urlkey":"paper-crafts","name":"Paper Crafts","id":17320},{"urlkey":"rubber-stamping","name":"Rubber Stamping","id":17350},{"urlkey":"scrapbooking-classes-workshops","name":"Scrapbooking Classes & Workshops","id":52231}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Crafty-in-Yonkers\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>A group where locals can meet, mingle and craft.

Laurie Bizzarro, P.C.\u201d representing Plaintiffs in personal injury, construction accidents and Employment Discrimination cases.<\/p>\n<p>GARY SUTO<\/p>\n<p>Gary Suto grew up with Hungarian\/Gypsy Grandparents and was surrounded with Astrology, Palmistry, Cardomancy and Numerology. He would not consider himself a Hereditary Witch, but very close to it. He has been practicing divination for 35 years, and his skills include Tarot, Iching, Numerology, Runes and Palmistry. He is a \u00a0High Priest of Temenos Ophiuchus, a grove of the Minoan Brotherhood; High Priest in NY Coven of Witches, a coven of the Wica Tradition, initiated by Lady Rhea; Founder of NY Gay Men's Open Pagan Circle; Co-creator of NY LGBT Open Pagan Circle; Co-founder of Prometheus Rising, Queer Men's Pagan Festival; Past Instructor at the Pagan Center of NY, Psychic Reader and life coach at Magickal Realms and Catland Bookstore; \u00a0He has given workshops and led rituals at various festivals and NYC locations. Hecate came to him at one of these festivals approximately 13 years ago and has been one of his main Deities ever since. On a mundane level he is a fashion designer and graphic designer. He is putting those skills to use in creating Pagan Clothing and Jewelry as well as a Tarot deck that will incorporate the Iching.<\/p>\n<p>JSTERLING HURLEY<\/p>\n<p>From his early childhood JSterling had a connection to the plants and animals who inhabited the woods surrounding his parent\u2019s farm in central Ohio. He was raised in an agnostic home with no formal spiritual guidance which allowed him to explore his own spiritual path as a young adult.<\/p>\n<p>As an out gay youth he worked against homophobia and charted his way through hostile environments and helped other gay youth through violence, ignorance and hate.<\/p>\n<p>JSterling is a High Priest of the Minoan Fellowship Tradition and is priest of the Minoan Brotherhood. He is a green witch and has used his knowledge of plants, aromatherapy and herbology both in his magickal and mundane life. He strives to provide a venue for the LGBT pagan community to become empowered and to reclaim their place as healers, shamans and guides of the dead.\u00a0 Throughout all his training both formal and informal the constant has been the connection to his patron Goddess, Hekate. For within himself She shines through. From the wisdom of the darkness She shine light. And from the potential locked within us all she provides the key of fullness.<\/p>\n<p>MARIO PABON ANDRACA<\/p>\n<p>\u200e<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mario.a.pabon?hc_location=timeline\">Mario Pab\u00f3n Andraca<\/a> has been a practicing pagan for over fifteen years. After being a solitary practitioner for a few years, Mario joined a Wiccan coven of the Gardnerian tradition called Polyhymnia Coven in New York City. He is now a Third Degree High Priest in this Coven.<\/p>\n<p>In 2012, after his first encounter with Hekate, Mario joined Arn Draiocht Fein (ADF), and successfully completed their Dedicants' program. Currently he is pursuing ADF's Clergy Training. Currently he holds the position of Scribe in the New York City Grove \"Inis Ull\".<\/p>\n<p>Mario has also recently joined both the Sorita D'Este's Covenant of Hekate, and Hellenion, a Greek Reconstructionis religious organization. Mario discovered Hekate in the Between the Worlds festival where she came to him and guided him to where he is today. His path is mostly Hellenic in private practice, while still teaching Wicca and leading a coven. Most recently he has been given the responsibility to lead and officiate the central Hekate rituals in the very same festival where she first came to him.<\/p>\n<p>MATTHEW SAWICKI<\/p>\n<p>Matthew Sawicki is a Traditional Witch and lifelong devotee of Hecate. He hails from the mountains of North Eastern Pennsylvania and learned much of his craft and magick from his upbringing there. Matthew has been initiated into three separate traditions of the craft, most notably The New York Wica Tradition where he is a 3rd Degree High Priest, The Minoan Brotherhood and the non-wiccan tradition of The Clan of Tubal Cain out of the UK, which remains his main focus and current tradition. Matthew has been a Priest of Hecate whose public rites have led people to her for over 10 years. Matthew is known for his \"Rites of Crossroads\" rituals at the Between the Worlds Men's Gathering in Ohio that has brought more than 80 men together in her worship. Matthew lives in New York City and looks forward to continuing his work as a priest of Hecate to those who seek her.<\/p>\n<p>ANNA LEWIS<\/p>\n<p>Anna Lewis, a NYC native Witch and Pagan is thrilled to be a part of the magick bringing The Temple of Hecate to light. She is a longtime friend of Lady Rhea, Magickal Realms and the NY Coven of Witches as well as Horn and Cauldron of Rhode Island. She currently lives in Rhode Island where she turns the wheel of the year with her young family, worships Yemaya in the sea by day and Hecate at the crossroads by night. She is grateful to the goddess for her many blessings and for the opportunity to aid others in their devotion.<\/p>\n<p>Please join our meetup page: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Temple-of-Hecate-Inc\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Temple-of-Hecate-Inc\/<\/a> and facebook page <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/333721350124288\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/333721350124288\/<\/a> (The Temple of Hecate, Inc.) for events and further information on the temple and our Directors.

Join the thousands of Citizens Climate Lobby members who are actually moving Congress toward bold climate solutions that could change everything. <br> CCL will change the way you think about democracy. We're not about marches and protests-- we're about you talking directly to your Senators, Congressmen and their top advisers. If you want to make real change happen, this is an incredibly effective form of advocacy. You will be amazed at how much power you have as an informed and inspired citizen. <br> There are lots of ways you can inform and influence your members of Congress-- through letters, emails, phone calls, newspaper articles, and through live meetings with your Congressman, Senators and their advisers. We'll teach you how to do any or all of the above-- wherever your comfort zone takes you. And we'll inspire you to maximize your effectiveness as an advocate for real climate solutions. <br> Best of all, we have a plan and a solid climate proposal for Congress that's actually gaining bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. It is non-partisan, politically viable, scientifically sound, and economically feasible. Economists say it is the most cost efficient approach. Scientists say it is our best shot at saving the planet. <br> We think New York area citizens deserve a special seat at the table when climate change is being discussed because when it comes to climate impacts and sea-level rise, they have a lot at stake. So we are focused on uniting New York area &nbsp;citizens this year. We already have established local CCL chapters in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens\/Nassau, Staten Island, Long Island, Westchester, and Columbia counties in NY, as well as Albany, Buffalo, Ithaca, Red Hook, Rochester, Syracuse, and Utica, NY, in Fairfield County in Connecticut, and in Central New Jersey. <br> Join us for an introductory conference call or New York Area Local meeting near you! <br> Website info: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.CitizensClimateLobby.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.CitizensClimateLobby.com<\/a> <br> What does climate scientist Dr. James Hansen say about CCL?\"Most impressive is the work of the Citizens Climate Lobby, a relatively new, fast-growing, nonpartisan, nonprofit group with [193] chapters across the United States and Canada.

This group is open to anyone who is interested in improving their fitness, losing weight, getting stronger and becoming more flexible. My classes are primarily focused on quality, not quantity meaning I'm looking for proper form and technique while using full range of motion. Each exercise circuit is timed to ensure everyone goes at their own pace. I also use progression and regression methods based on fitness levels to ensure you are getting to most out your workout. I don't like to call my class boot camp because it sounds like a hard core, going all out until you puke class. Rather, I like to call it personal group training because its intimate in size and I can give the small groups of 10 or less individualized attention.

In addition, we have noticed that most of the language assistance content has been focused on oral communication and reading of non-fiction\/short articles in English.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0The organizers of this new meetup hope to bring back the meetings to the local community: Queens. In addition to English speaking and language and cultural exchange,\u00a0we will also be focusing on writing--both academic and creative (pros\/poetry) as well as reading fiction, non-fiction, short essays, articles, excerpts from books, and poems every two weeks. Hopefully, the readings will spark discussion about themes, concepts, ideas and issues relevant the Asia diaspora; Asian American; Pacific Islander and immigrant experience.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Our target audience is those of Asian descent in NY (Manhattan, Queens, LI, Brooklyn, Staten Island, Bronx, and Queens). Book lovers, writers, and students are encouraged to join our meetings. Whether you are a novice writer, who needs feedback, criticism, or even proof-reading; or an accomplished writer, who would like to see how your writing will be accepted by the public and how people will be impacted by your writing; or a student working on a research paper for school; in all cases, we encourage you to submit your writing and join our meet-up group. Hopefully, these original pieces will also stimulate discussion relevant to diverse Asian communities in NY and the immigrant and international experience that is NYC.<\/p>\n<p>All sorts of writing are encouraged: short stories, poems, articles or essays. There will also be opportunities for peer-to-peer proofreading and also sharing your original writings with the group. There also maybe workshops on how to advance your research skills using our American library system.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0And, finally, we hope to include events and activities that will allow our members to explore the city and get to know each other better. Events such as book readings and signings, dinners, or events at the Asian American Writers Workshop, or visits to interesting but obscure used bookstores, will be included.

We know the fear that bubbles up every time we're asked our name, or need help finding an address, ordering food, or even just meeting an old friend. We go to therapy- some of us for years- spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars- trying to free our words.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Even with every physical skill in the book at our disposal, however, \u00a0something's missing. \u00a0We're still not convinced we have a right to share, loud and clear, the stories, opinions, and quirks that make us who we are. That's because the key to a full life isn't in the hour-a -week spent in the clinic support group, trying to pour your heart out in the three minutes you have before someone starts getting antsy. Talking about what's going on inside certainly has its place in the therapy process, but lasting change can only come from <i>living loudly<\/i>- actually going out into the world and communicating, on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p>That's why I (we ) started NYFS. We're planning on regular ( once a week to two weeks) meetups- some just to hang out, and some structured in such a way that we each face a particular type of communication challenge, with the support of the group behind us. This desensitizes us to the fear of disfluent speech,; the fear of being different.<\/p>\n<p>Examples include:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Going into a department store and asking where you might find the dinner plates<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 \u00a0Asking a bus driver for directions as people are getting on ( to help experience time pressure)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Placing complicated pizza orders over the phone.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Talking to a member of the opposite ( or same) sex that you'd like to get to know better, romantically or otherwise<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Talking to a stranger in the park about what you're doing and what stuttering is exactly ( you'd be surprised at how receptive most people are to it!)<\/p>\n<p>Now, we know that everyone is in a different place with their stuttering. That's why, for the first few weeks, we'll be splitting people into groups based on what they're comfortable with- Easy, Medium, and Difficult challenges. I or another group leader will be available to help talk you through what you're feeling beforehand and to offer support, no matter where you're at.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b><i>We<\/i><\/b> <b><i>ARE NOT<\/i> \u00a0licensed speech pathologists, and don't claim to offer therapy.

We are a separate entity and nobody has to join anything to work with us.<\/p>\n<p>We sit around a big wooden table and we talk about what we want to change about ourselves and what we have to do to make that happen. New habits we want to cultivate. Old habits we want to let go of. Beliefs or reactions we have that are harmful to us and other people. Sometimes we discuss ethics or science or religion.<\/p>\n<p>We decide on goals for ourselves and go to the Ethics Lab to report and for support.<\/p>\n<p>Examples:<\/p>\n<p>Mindfulness meditations. Losing weight. Finding a correct lay monastery to join. Developing your critical faculties by use of formal logic and\/or mathematics. Overcoming addictions including addictions to emotions or ideas. Gaining weight. Expressing yourself through artwork. Prayer. Joining a group so you can trick yourself into reinventing yourself. Yoga. Finding a boyfriend or girlfriend. Jogging. Changing careers.<\/p>\n<p>Someone pointed out that we are keeping the art of conversation alive. Yep. With a bit of Socratic method, performance art and good old fashioned magic smoke &amp; mirrors mixed in.<\/p>\n<p>Three examples of the kind of thing I might recommend to someone during a talk at the Ethics Lab.<\/p>\n<p>1. Decide on the thing you want to change in yourself and then only commit to observing yourself as it is happening as the very first step.<\/p>\n<p>2. Taking the time to find out what your thoughts and feelings are about your thoughts and feelings.<\/p>\n<p>3. Understanding that meditating can be whatever you are doing at the moment.<\/p>\n<p>An Ethics Lab is a place where people with different even opposing beliefs meet and learn that we are of value to each other because of those differences.

Toastmasters International is a world leader in communication and leadership development. Members of Toastmasters improve their speaking skills by attending recurring meetings where they deliver speeches or evaluate other speakers. Membership in Toastmasters is one of the greatest investments you can make in yourself. How Does It Work? A Toastmasters meeting is a learn-by-doing workshop in which participants hone their speaking and leadership skills in a no-pressure atmosphere. There is no instructor in a Toastmasters meeting. Instead, members evaluate one another\u2019s presentations. This feedback process is a key part of the program\u2019s success.

We already have this capability in place. However, in complex systems, the real operational challenges arise from the way system components interact. Some of these components live inside our data center, some live outside our data center, and all are updating on differing timelines. The functionality and performance of every component has the potential to change every day.<\/p>\n<p>Our challenge is to identify patterns and correlations across multiple systems in our stack. We need to integrate top-down and bottom-up analysis, so we can see, for example, that trial subscription signups (a user metric) fell off at the same time that an internal API call began to fail (an application metric), and it was caused by a database host falling offline (a system metric).<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>When collecting so much data, there is a risk of being overwhelmed and not being able to make sense of it all. In essence, a risk of collecting data but not producing intelligence. We combat this risk by converting our accumulated data into the most visually information-dense format available: graphs.

Things only the top 10% of Wealthy Households buy have no sales tax. Sadly that\u2019s True.<\/p>\n<p>Even Worse the top ten percent of American Households have 81% to 94% of stocks, bonds, trust funds, and business equity, and almost 80% of non-home real estate. Since financial wealth is what counts as far as the control of income-producing assets, we can say that just 10% of the people own the United States of America. Sadly this is another clear example of: Those that have the gold get to make the rules.<\/p>\n<p>Organizations representing over 100,000,000 Americans are now involved with the American Robin Hood Tax Campaign. Thousands of endorsers, 100\u2019s of Organization endorsers, over 1,000 economists, the Vatican, Some of the brightest minds in the country and the 4 of the richest men in America, have endorsed the Robin Hood Tax on Wall Street.<\/p>\n<p>Three Benefits of the Robin Hood Tax<br>\n\n Although every Robin Hood Tax has its own specific intended purpose, there are some general intended purposes which are common to most of them. Below are some of those general commonalities. The intended purpose may or may not be achieved.<br>\n\n Curbing volatility of financial markets<br>\n\n In 1936, when Keynes first proposed a financial transaction tax, he wrote, \"Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the situation is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation.\" Rescuing enterprise from becoming \"the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation\" was also an intended purpose of the Robin Hood Tax and is a common theme in several other types of financial transaction taxes.<br>\n\n More fair and equitable tax collection<br>\n\n Another common theme is the proposed intention to create a system of more fair and equitable tax collection. An Automated Payment Robin Hood tax taxes the broadest possible tax base, namely all transactions including all financial asset transactions. Instead of introducing progressivity through the tax rate structure, the flat rate introduces progressiveness through the tax base since the highest income and wealth groups undertake a disproportionate share of financial transactions.<br>\n\n According to several leading figures, the \"fairness\" aspect of a financial transaction tax has eclipsed, and\/or replaced, \"prevention of volatility\" as the most important purpose for the tax. Fraser Reilly-King of Halifax Initiative is one such economist: he sees a Robin Hood Tax as important for bringing a more equitable balance to the taxation of all parts of the economy.[23]<br>\n\n Less susceptible to tax evasion than alternatives<br>\n\n According to some economists, a financial transaction tax is less susceptible to tax avoidance and tax evasion than other types of taxes proposed for the financial sector. An Automated Payment Robin Hood Tax employs 21st century technology for automatically assessing and collecting taxes when transactions are settled through the electronic technology of the banking payments system. Stop Blaming the Poor for Wall Streets Greed<\/p>\n<p>Warren Buffett isn\u2019t the only rich guy who wants to higher taxes on the rich, such as The Robin Hood tax which he has specifically endorsed. A survey from Spectrem Group found that 68% of millionaires (those with investments of $1 million or more) support raising taxes on those with $1 million or more in income. Fully 61% of those worth of $5 million or more support increased taxes on million-plus earners.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/c\/4\/highres_409075492.jpeg","photo_id":409075492,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/c\/4\/600_409075492.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/c\/4\/thumb_409075492.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":170802232,"name":"Robin Hood"},"members":4,"name":"Manhattan - Robin Hood Tax on Wall Street Campaign Events","id":16974892,"state":"NY","urlname":"Robin-Hood-Tax-on-Wall-Street-Campaign-Events-USA","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Robin Hood's Team Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410639851000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"digcam","name":"Digital Photography","id":206},{"urlkey":"photo","name":"Photography","id":223},{"urlkey":"nature-photography","name":"Nature Photography","id":16600},{"urlkey":"landscape-photography","name":"Landscape Photography","id":22268},{"urlkey":"night-photography","name":"Night Photography","id":32968},{"urlkey":"street-photography","name":"Street Photography","id":49954},{"urlkey":"night-photography-workshop","name":"night photography workshop","id":127998}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYNight\/","rating":4.42,"description":"<p>New York has a long, rich history of night photography.

We think we are not good enough, our work is not good enough, will be judged, we lack enough talent or imagination or commitment or time, we can\u2019t trust the future, we need more ambition and drive, and on and on. We cannot get beyond our fears and start doing our artistic work full-out and then putting our work out there for others to experience. We become closeted artists, and if we do manage to express ourselves artistically, we shy away from sharing it with others, with the world \u2014 full-out. We fear criticism mostly. Failure. Rejection. We want to be approved of, to be appreciated and recognized. Being appreciated is not bad, but when it becomes more important than our self-expression, it doesn't bring any fulfillment at all. Mainly, we are just too self-critical. There is nothing holding us back but us. When we see this negative pattern with gentle guidance, we can laugh at the illogic of it all and move into doing our creative work with passion and inspiration. The seriousness is gone, so our \"work\" becomes our \"play.\" We will use The Work of Byron Katie, a powerful but gentle tool for self-investigation, to get at our deep, underlying beliefs that stop us from fulfilling our dreams to write, dance, paint, sculpt, act, play music, make a movie, cook, create a business, do anything that we want to do. Join us and get to work on the beliefs and fears that stop you from being the fully creative person you secretly want to be. For more information about Byron Katie and her work, go to thework.com or read her book Loving What Is. There are plenty of youtube.com videos of Katie doing The Work with others and explaining how The Work works. &nbsp;Another good addition to this meetup is my meetup \"Marketing for Artists and Other Creative People\" at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Marketing-for-Artists-and-Other-Creative-People\/grow\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Marketing-for-Artists-and-Other-Creative-People\/grow\/<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I hope to see you soon at our meet up! &nbsp; &nbsp;Ben, Your Organizer<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14005872,"name":"DezVFX"},"members":1485,"name":"Unblocking Your Creativity","id":17017142,"state":"NY","urlname":"UnblockingYourCreativity","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Creative People"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410833210000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"latinmusic","name":"Latin Music","id":130},{"urlkey":"salsa","name":"Salsa","id":1122},{"urlkey":"ballroomdance","name":"Ballroom Dancing","id":3998},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"latin-dance","name":"Latin Dance","id":17993},{"urlkey":"dance-lessons","name":"Dance Lessons","id":19146},{"urlkey":"bachata","name":"Bachata","id":20160},{"urlkey":"merengue","name":"Merengue","id":20216},{"urlkey":"ballroom-latin-salsa-swing-tango-hustle","name":"Ballroom, Latin, Salsa, Swing, Tango, Hustle","id":20839},{"urlkey":"hustle-dancing","name":"Hustle Dancing","id":21002},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"latin-dancing-salsa-merengue","name":"Latin Dancing - Salsa, Merengue","id":33158},{"urlkey":"salsa-dance-lessons","name":"Salsa Dance Lessons","id":39135},{"urlkey":"salsa-classes","name":"Salsa Classes","id":44955},{"urlkey":"salsa-for-singles","name":"Salsa for Singles","id":52314}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ProAmDanceTeamNYC\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Do You enjoy dancing Latin, Ballroom, Salsa or all of these dances?

As each year passes, and our world remains incapable of summoning the will to respond meaningfully, the crisis grows more menacing, and the cost of our eventual, inevitable response increases. This cost is measured not in millions, but in billions of dollars that could easily extend into the trillions. But that\u2019s not our primary concern.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Our problem is that in 2014, the Pew Research Center reported that Americans ranked global warming near the bottom of Presidential and Congressional priorities for the years 2009 through 2014, and that only 44 percent of Americans currently believe there is solid evidence the phenomenon exists, and is anthropogenic. We believe that Climate Rescue Capitalism can play an important role in solving this problem.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Climate Rescue Capitalism is an economic tool that empowers our world\u2019s people to fight climate change every time we buy the products we routinely buy. It is a way to use capitalism to directly fight climate change, rather than to further enrich the corporations that are preventing our world from taking responsible action on climate change. In other words, Climate Rescue Capitalism calls on humanity to go into business for the sake and interests of humanity, and market products that compete with, and win against, products marketed by today\u2019s controlling population.<\/p>\n<p>I refer to this market-based means of increasing humanity\u2019s ability to fight climate change as Climate Rescue Capitalism for two reasons. First, because it is a capitalist venture designed expressly to fund the fight against climate change. And second, because it is a free-market capitalist venture in every sense of the word.

The members of this group seek to eat healthfully not from a place of discipline, but from a place of love and and understanding of the nature of one's cravings and urges. Together as a group we can explore different techniques, books, teachers, practices, or activities that support our goal, but more importantly I would like to offer a place to meet and discuss ( hopefully weekly) where we can create community and support each other in our journey to better health. I myself am a candidate for Pure Yoga training, and would be interested in developing a regular optional yoga class that is designed to support those with chronic weight issues, so perhaps that can also be on the agenda.","lon":-73.9599990845,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7961191,"name":"Rebecca "},"members":310,"name":"New York  Holistic and Spiritual Weight Loss Meetup","id":17212242,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Holistic-and-Spiritual-Weight-Loss-Meetup","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1411680083000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"business","name":"Business","id":10575},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"business-owners","name":"Business Owners","id":15417},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"small-business-owners","name":"Small Business Owners","id":20743},{"urlkey":"women-small-business-owners","name":"Women Small Business Owners","id":23633}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Business-Career-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"This group is for Biz Owners in Williamsburg and Greenpoint to develop relationships and grow their business.

I have covered a variety of mediums: Mix Media Art, Fiber Art, Paper Art and Origami, Painting, Drawing, Set and stage design, Photography and Filmmaking, Economical Friendly Art Installations, Murals, Technical Drafting, Interior Design, Computer-Aid-Design and Architecture.<br><\/p>\n<p>My interest in building a group is: <br><\/p>\n<p>1. To meet Designers and Artists where we can all exchange and learn from each others work. <br><\/p>\n<p>2. To create a meditative space where we can create our work.<\/p>\n<p>3. I make sure part of my meetups are dedicated to parents with small children who never had the chance to get to know the passion inside of themselves and hoping they can find a space here to create artistically. <br><\/p>\n<p>4. I am a lover of traveling so I love to hear and share stories from people that come from other countries and go to visit the country myself to learn about different cultures.<\/p>\n<p>If What you are looking for is 3 or more of the above, You are encouraged to join! We are all about creating a positive lifestyle with arts and retreats. <br><\/p>\n<p> About The Group:<br><\/p>\n<p>We are CREATIVE DESIGNERS who are not just about pick and choose materials for a space but also working creatively on making a space, indoor or out, into creative spaces such as customized ceiling murals, economical-friendly Installations\/ Visual Displays. <br><\/p>\n<p>Do you ever wonder how to get a project started? or have you gotten in the middle of a project and needed someone to give you a nudge to help you thinking outside the box so you can see the project at a new perspective? How about brainstorming with collages, or coming up with a design pattern for a partition wall? How do I achieve that result?&nbsp; I am here to help you spark that creativity within you.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>It sounds fantastic, and we need pure confidence. Knowing that we can make something seems impossible at times when we are so caught up in our lives. SO here I am, working on the creative person in me, I want to create a group to come together with those who are at a creative block at times like myself, we all need some inspiration. We all have build-up on creativity when we dont use it, We're are all talented with something. <br><\/p>\n<p>Whether you are at beginning level, Graduated or an Emerging Professional who did, or learning all aspects of design or getting creative with art projects, me and others are here to encourage you to get that project started and accomplished! To be sure that you get the practice with sufficient hands on experience. <br> <\/p>\n<p>We are based in the Bronx, but we will be holding some meet ups in New York City, go to shows &amp; events, design shops and workshops as we learn to do artistic things like drawing, painting and the process of making something creative. Depending on the experience of our Design Enthusiasts available, we hope to put together some hands-on real projects experiences and tailor meet ups according to our members, so be sure to let us know what you hope to achieve with us. <br> <\/p>\n<p>Be sure to check out our group pages at the top panel, as we will consistently update inspirational websites of Art and Design Trends. Also, come back check out our calendar even when there are no meetup scheduled, we could be meeting up with other interior design group events in the city. If you have something in mind, be sure to let us know what you like to see and achieve at an upcoming meetup and we will surely do our best to tailor our meetups to the best of our group member's interest. <br><\/p>\n<p>Join us Now!<br> <\/p>\n<p>To get to know me and my company, please stay tune and find me on Pinterest and Facebook and the following links:<\/p>\n<p>Pinterest.com\/monliudesigns<\/p>\n<p><span>Mon Liu Designs Gallery &amp; Inspirations<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/155577364485769\/\">&nbsp;&nbsp; https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/155577364485769\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p> <br> <\/p>","lon":-73.8799972534,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/6\/1\/highres_440584449.jpeg","photo_id":440584449,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/6\/1\/600_440584449.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/6\/1\/thumb_440584449.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":55263712,"name":"Monica Judy Liu"},"members":21,"name":"Upper NYC Design & Art Group","id":17244512,"state":"NY","urlname":"UpperNyc-Design-Art-Meetup-Group","category":{"name":"hobbies\/crafts","id":15,"shortname":"hobbies-crafts"},"lat":40.8400001526,"who":"Creative Designers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1411850106000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"guided-meditation","name":"Guided Meditation","id":21628},{"urlkey":"meditation-and-healing","name":"Meditation and Healing","id":24118},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Twin-Heart-Meditation-Pranic-Healing-NYC\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This is a group for anyone interested in meditation and\/or energy healing .

We want to avoid competitive training and promote co-operative collaboration and mutual support. Our desire is to be quite unique...to be VERY different than the stereotype that music educators often seem to portray. Check out (info@beyondrock.org) (facebook.com\/beyondrockcamp). That 2-4 week summer program is a model of something 'truly' unique. We desire a year round expansion of that program...this is our ultimate goal... classes, lessons, diverse workshops, showcases, etc.\u00a0 Anyone who wants to serve kids\/teens with teaching and coaching rock\/pop\/alternative\/hip-hop\/etc. music (as primary) but ALSO in various other areas... conflict resolution, acceptance of new ideas, theater improv therapy (through theater games), yoga, an array of creative activities and community and confidence reinforcement. Helping kids\/teens \"step outside their comfort zones\" with no fear of judgement. The teaching is one thing and takes exceptional people... still, it's the skilled, strategic, pro-active, organization, directorship and management part that is the really tough part.\u00a0 It takes the combination of educator, humanitarian and entrepreneur to implement such a mission. With all participants from administration to volunteers to equipment setup to instructors...we absolutely prefer the concept of the 'work WITH' mentality...we're not all that fond of the term 'work FOR'. A socialistic, democratic angle to building a company...perhaps...but it seems to work amazingly well with Beyond Rock. A feeling of ownership is essential to develop passion in an individual. That said, obviously there still needs to be an agreement on philosophy and mission and those individuals who thoughtfully plan &amp; guide - leading the course of events. They need to be sharp, very pro-active, extraordinarily communicative (staff, parents, students) and decisive.<br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-73.6399993896,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/5\/6\/highres_415797942.jpeg","photo_id":415797942,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/5\/6\/600_415797942.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/5\/6\/thumb_415797942.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":116670792,"name":"Maria,Scott & Michael (founders)"},"members":90,"name":"Business Entrepreneurs With Music Education in Mind","id":17300272,"state":"NY","urlname":"Music-Educators-With-Spiritual-Based-Business-in-Mind","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Music Educators Entrepreneurs"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1412041509000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"transgender","name":"TG","id":1237},{"urlkey":"genderqueer","name":"genderqueer","id":4562},{"urlkey":"lgbt-social-group","name":"LGBT Social Group","id":17665},{"urlkey":"gender-fluid","name":"Gender Fluid","id":25560},{"urlkey":"gender-queer","name":"Gender Queer","id":34510},{"urlkey":"where-to-meet-other-tg-people","name":"Where to Meet other TG People","id":37560},{"urlkey":"shemales","name":"Shemales","id":49111},{"urlkey":"queer-socializing","name":"Queer Socializing","id":51392},{"urlkey":"queer-and-questioning","name":"Queer and Questioning","id":53773},{"urlkey":"male-to-female-mtf-transgender","name":"Male to Female, MTF, Transgender","id":62199},{"urlkey":"transsexuals","name":"Transsexuals","id":63635},{"urlkey":"transgender-women","name":"Transgender Women","id":67037},{"urlkey":"transgender-mtf","name":"Transgender MtF","id":138956},{"urlkey":"tgirl","name":"tgirl","id":503042},{"urlkey":"transgender-non-binary","name":"TransGender \u00b7 Non-Binary","id":1497202}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Nonbinary-Safe-Space-NYC\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>There are not a lot of safe spaces for nonbinary\/gender variant individuals to meet and socialize, so we've taken the liberty of creating one in NYC.

Join our fun filled environment, meet new people (who also love dancing), &nbsp;and learn the most important concepts of dance, music, and body movement.<\/p> \n<p>A little sample of our work in San Francisco:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zij9c5l5j8s\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zij9c5l5j8s<\/a><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/1\/f\/highres_437734079.jpeg","photo_id":437734079,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/1\/f\/600_437734079.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/1\/f\/thumb_437734079.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":174908692,"name":"Arkadiy Stepanchuk"},"members":309,"name":"New York Latin Ballroom Dancing Lessons","id":17361602,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Ballroom-Latin-Dancing-Meetup","category":{"name":"dancing","id":5,"shortname":"dancing"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Ballroom Dance Lovers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1412279228000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"speed-dating","name":"Speed Dating","id":15233},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"singles-dancing","name":"Singles Dancing","id":19144},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"singles-events","name":"Singles events","id":29852},{"urlkey":"20-somethings","name":"20 somethings","id":50188},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"single-professionals-20s-40s","name":"Single Professionals 20's-40's","id":65341},{"urlkey":"singles-singles-singles","name":"Singles, Singles, Singles","id":115707},{"urlkey":"20-and-30-something-singles","name":"20 and 30 something singles","id":200801},{"urlkey":"speed-dating-20s-and-30s","name":"Speed Dating 20s and 30s","id":484552}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Singles-events-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This group is for singles ages 20s &amp; 30s who<span>&nbsp;live in the New York City area.

While we are primarily East Coast, Brooklyn based gamers, our online community contains gamers who we regularly play with across many different States (Utah, Colorado, New Orleans, Massachusetts... etc), across many different platforms and games. We also keep in contact with one another across many different mediums, such as facebook, skype, internet forums, and regular text. As gamers we are all adults, with full-time jobs, some with families, and\/or pursing further schooling. As a result, our atmosphere is drama-free, friendly, and mature. Who has time for drama when you have work in the morning? Ages 21+ is our preferred atmosphere. We enjoy online gaming not just as a hobby, but also a means to foster communities and build friendships. Many of us, are not just fellow gamers who share in a hobby, but are also real life friends. Many of those friendships were formed within different online gaming communities across the decade. We hope our meetup group will continue to build these types of positive relationships created by gaming. As a gaming group, we are an eclectic group with different tastes who all consider online gaming a hobby. Many of us are both casual and hardcore online gamers, with roots also stemming in tabletop and collectible card games (MTG, Yu-Gi-Oh, Versus, Pokemon, D&amp;D... etc).<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>We are currently engaged in Destiny for the Playstation 4 and Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn across multiple platforms and are actively recruiting. While online guilds and clans are a-plenty, our group likes to know who we're playing with. If you're interested in joining our local online gaming community and our other extended online gaming community, we tend to meet-up at different places in Brooklyn and NYC.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>In addition, think of our meetup as a way to meet new people who might be playing other online games as well. We hope this is an opportunity to form brand new communities, organic, specifically to meetup. Take the opportunity to meet new people and see what types of games they play. It's a great opportunity to find similar ground in similar games, to build relationships in-game and as well as in real life.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Typically we meet at Xe May Sandwich Shop: 96 St Marks Pl, New York, NY 10009.

The rest of the time is for you to connect with like-minded people working on similar challenges.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>Come and join us!<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"embedded\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jJS5jMkbXNA\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jJS5jMkbXNA<\/a><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><\/p>","lon":-73.9400024414,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/4\/2\/2\/highres_419137922.jpeg","photo_id":419137922,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/4\/2\/2\/600_419137922.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/4\/2\/2\/thumb_419137922.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":49605182,"name":"Edward Wisniewski"},"members":504,"name":"Designing Change","id":17471532,"state":"NY","urlname":"DesigningChange","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Movers and Shakers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Holmdel","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1412729466000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"autistic-spectrum-disorders","name":"Autistic Spectrum Disorders","id":21466},{"urlkey":"adult-teens-with-asperger-spectrum-disorders","name":"Adult\/Teens with Asperger\/Spectrum Disorders","id":22640},{"urlkey":"singles-with-aspergers","name":"Singles with Aspergers","id":23749},{"urlkey":"adults-with-aspergers-syndrome","name":"Adults with Asperger's Syndrome","id":25053},{"urlkey":"adult-aspies","name":"Adult Aspies","id":39225},{"urlkey":"asperger-syndrome","name":"Asperger Syndrome","id":77838},{"urlkey":"aspergers-support-group","name":"Asperger's Support Group","id":83682},{"urlkey":"aspergers-syndrome","name":"Aspergers Syndrome","id":100878},{"urlkey":"aspergers-social-group","name":"Asperger's Social Group","id":111988},{"urlkey":"friends-of-aspies","name":"Friends of Aspies","id":144388},{"urlkey":"social-skills-for-aspies","name":"Social Skills for Aspies","id":162162},{"urlkey":"parents-of-aspies","name":"Parents of Aspies","id":169331},{"urlkey":"parents-of-adult-aspies-support-group","name":"Parents of Adult Aspies Support Group","id":1355132}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adult-Active-Jersey-Shore-Apies-Ages-18-100\/","rating":4.5,"description":"This is a group for anyone with Asperger's (self-diagnosed too) who wants to meet others, socialize, do some fun activities and share.

We began as one-part support group and one-part strategy session, playing with slogans and ideas we thought Democrats needed to be saying. And when we came up with a particularly good slogan, we made buttons. Occasionally, we bring in group questions, or talking points to back up the buttons. Sometimes our group list shares articles and forwards.

It started in 2003, during what was a fairly rough time to be politically liberal, as a group that was one-part support group and one-part strategy session, playing with slogans and ideas we thought the political left needed to be saying. And when we came up with a particularly good slogan, we made buttons. Occasionally, we bring in group questions, or talking points to back up the buttons. Sometimes our group list shares articles and forwards. But mostly, we keep it non-programmatic and free-flowing and create a space where people learn about each other's ideas, activities and enlarge a circle of progressive friends.

you're on the cusp of a big change in your life that you want to make the most of (a<\/span> <a>new job<\/a><span>, the end or beginning of a relationship, a big move, becoming a parent), or perhaps you're poised to take a big risk (maybe start that business you've always wanted, publish a novel,<\/span> <a>write a screenplay<\/a><span>, take a trip or <a>move abroad<\/a>, etc.). \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Or maybe you don't know exactly what you want, you just know you're not where you want to be and you're ready for everything to change. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If any of this resonates with you, this group is the right place for you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This group is for those of us who do not want to watch our unlived life go by -- the one we know in our hearts we were meant to live -- and who are ready to start taking some big steps to find and follow our heart's calling. \u00a0<span>It does not matter what your background is, how old you are, what your profession is, or what stage of the journey you are at -- commitment to the journey itself is the only requirement here. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Of course, succeeding in pursuing your heart's goals is not just about reaching\u00a0a fork in the road and choosing the\u00a0path less traveled -- it's also about\u00a0STAYING on that unbeaten path without running back to the old, \"safe\" path at the first sign of difficulty (a temptation that can be very hard to resist). \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0best way to do this -- indeed, perhaps the ONLY way to successfully do this -- is with the support of like-minded people, which is exactly what this group is about.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We hope you will join us for a series of free interactive workshops designed to support those of us who want to live an unbounded life full of unlimited possibilities -- a life where our heart's desires are not only possible, but, inevitable. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The workshops will focus on such topics as risk-taking, recognizing and breaking through limiting beliefs, learning how to tap into and make the most of synchronicity, and the art of manifestation, among other topics. \u00a0We also want to hear from members as to what topics they'd like to have the free workshops cover. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The end-goal here is to share, learn from each other, support each other, bounce ideas off each other without judgment, and create a community that promotes and celebrates risk-taking for your heart's goals (which, unfortunately, our families, friends and society are not always on board with).

(Many of them even include Q&amp;A with stars\/director\/writers. Such screenings will be featured on this site) And I can't be the only one who thought it would be fun to go there with multiple people, getting together after the movie and talk about what we just saw. (And maybe, you might meet someone new...) If that's what you have in mind, this meetup is for you.<\/p>\n<p>Wouldn't it be nice to be able to see movies possibly with the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, Matt Damon, Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, Steven Spielberg, Bill Murray, George Clooney, Kiera Knightly, Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Robert DeNiro, Hillary Swank, Felicity Jones, etc and ask them questions directly in person afterwards? For all this for free? Or see all these Oscar contender films before everyone else has a chance to see them at all at some gorgeous and cushy private screening rooms (with no worries for bedbugs)? This is a privilege we have as voters (who are truly in this show business and really work there, not as a spectator) and that's the experience we will be able to share once you join this group, ultimately will lead us into our exclusive Oscars Viewing Party.<\/p>\n<p>(I wish I could make the site more visible for non-members so that people can actually see what kind of movies we are offering. Unfortunately, the team of studio attorneys warned us that we are being watched - for understandable reason since we deal with many yet-to-be-released films and Q&amp;A events with high profile celebrities - so I'll have to make it private until you join us once the award season gets underway. Sorry about that.)<\/p>\n<p>Voters are entitled to one guest (note: guests do NOT need to be guild members) so the numbers can grow pretty quickly. However, in terms of joining this group, we need to limit to people in the 20s - 50s who are members of any of the following (required to be able to actually sign up for the screenings for free - Studios do check the membership card so please be honest. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to help you): AMPAS, HFPA, BAFTA, SAG-AFTRA, DGA, PGA, WGA and others.

I'm also a visual person for my day job, so I can teach you some very basic technical principals, though I'll mostly talk about the composition of your frame. I'm mostly intuitive as opposed to overly technical, however, I'm very creative and perhaps I can help you \"see\" through your viewfinder in a different way. I'm very patient and non-judgmental - all that matters to me is that you want to have fun while improving the visual quality of your work.<\/p>\n<p>It would be better if you had a real camera (a point and shoot is fine) as opposed to a cell phone or ipad, but if that's all you have then I might be able to give you at least a couple of pointers. This won't be a super technical meetup, but I can get you on your way to having a nicely composed and well-lighted shot.<\/p>\n<p>Between meetups be sure to check the group message board on occasion, as I will be posting sites that can give you quick and easy tips to help you along in your photographic journey.<\/p>\n<p><span>Also - when going to one of our meetups please keep in mind that if you RSVP \"Yes\" to an event but then cannot make it and do not change your RSVP to \"No\" or send me a message you cannot attend (for two separate meetups), that you will be expelled from the group.
