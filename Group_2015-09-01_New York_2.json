Trading is even more of a challenge if done in isolation. That is why we focus on banding together groups of traders so that you are taken out of that isolation and become part of an open forum where like minded professional, intermediate and novice traders share their trading concepts, ideas and experiences.<\/p>\r\n<p>Our approach to trading is a technical one which relies on specific chart patterns to identify the major shifts in market sentiment. Although we take on longer term positions to build wealth, our main focus is on the income producing Scalp, Day and Swing Trading styles.<\/p>\r\n<p>While we do and will have in person events, we have found that getting together online is much more efficient. Unlike on location events, when you attend our meet-ups online, you can do so from the comfort of your home or office. In this virtual classroom setting you will be able to listen and see the presenter discuss the material as well as view what is on his screen through application sharing and whiteboard technology. You will also be able to interact by asking questions and viewing questions posted by other members.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-74.4100036621,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/1\/c\/0\/highres_18709600.jpeg","photo_id":18709600,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/1\/c\/0\/600_18709600.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/1\/c\/0\/thumb_18709600.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":5442884,"name":"Alex Popovych"},"members":561,"name":"NJ Active Traders","id":1470688,"state":"NJ","urlname":"NJActiveTraders","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.5800018311,"who":"Traders"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1244719803000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"tea","name":"Tea","id":230},{"urlkey":"brit","name":"Expat British","id":301},{"urlkey":"anglophile","name":"Anglophile","id":2022},{"urlkey":"britcoms","name":"British Comedies","id":3430},{"urlkey":"baking","name":"Baking","id":15718},{"urlkey":"british-film","name":"British Film","id":17310},{"urlkey":"cooking-any-and-all-kinds-of-cooking","name":"Cooking","id":43256}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-British-Meetup\/","rating":4.75,"description":"<p style=\"text-align : center\">Greetings!

It's all about watching movies, making friends, having lively discussions and, perhaps most importantly, it's about supporting the filmmakers themselves.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : center\"><span style=\"font-size : medium\"><em><strong>Female filmmakers NEED US!<\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p>They need us to buy tickets the <em><strong>FIRST WEEK their films hit the theaters.<\/strong><\/em> Those numbers will determine whether that filmmaker will ever get a distribution deal again. Sucks, huh?<\/p>\n<p>But here's the deal, they also need us to <em>appreciate<\/em> these films they've worked so hard to get make for us. We, the <em>audience<\/em>, are what keeps these women writing scripts, doggedly pursuing funding and sacrificing who-knows-what to get that film made and distributed.<\/p>\n<p>Surprise, surprise! Sexism is alive and well in both Hollywood and the Independent Film industry, and the powers that be think any film with a female protagonist is a \"chick flick.\" Films with male protagonists are \u2026 you guessed it \u2026 \"films\".\u00a0 Now, I agree that there are chick flicks AND dick flicks (I like both) but mostly there are just - films about people living their lives. And we need more of them to be about women's lives. The prevailing belief systems of the 'powers that be\" is that our lives are simply boring,\u00a0 stupid and, actually unimportant.\u00a0 Unless we are models. With big breasts.<\/p>\n<p>This belief system is insidious and works it's way into the minds of men and women around the world. If the only important lives are men's, then our lives are \u2026 expendable. I truly believe that the way women are depicted in film directly influences they way women are treated in the world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So, let's go to the movies!<\/strong> I'm in NJ but have opened the group up to NYers, too. I often get busy so I've set it up so YOU can suggest a meetup in your area and I can bestow Event Organizer status to you so it becomes your project. I keep it simple and meet everyone in the lobby AFTER a film so we can all go off to a coffee shop to discuss it.

That organization has since merged with NYWIFT but <strong>Cinema-Femina<\/strong> still remains a pet project of mine. A few years ago I created this meetup and we had lots of fun but got busy with my own projects and handed it off to Kerrie \u2026 now I'm back and I hope we can use this group as a way to hook up with others to go see brand new films as well as those they may have fallen through the cracks.<\/p>","lon":-74.2799987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/5\/a\/e\/highres_109194702.jpeg","photo_id":109194702,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/5\/a\/e\/600_109194702.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/5\/a\/e\/thumb_109194702.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7334647,"name":"Francesca Rizzo"},"members":378,"name":"Cinema-Femina","id":1472126,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Cinema-Femina","category":{"name":"movies\/film","id":20,"shortname":"movies-film"},"lat":40.6100006104,"who":"Cinema-Feminists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1245038395000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"new-moms-expecting-moms-and-young-families-nyc","name":"New Moms, Expecting Moms, and Young Families NYC","id":25550}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bigcitymoms\/","rating":4.69,"description":"Big City Moms is the original social program for moms in NYC by creating and hosting exciting events for moms, expectant moms as well as the whole family.

KTCP is a specialized area of Kyusho.<\/p>\n<p><span>The Kyusho Tactical Control Program is designed for Law Enforcement, Security Personnel, EMS, or any other Agency that might have a need to physically control and restrain someone after the initial stage of verbal command has passed. Because the \"use of force\" issue is under fierce public attention, field officer's own safety is put at risk. The brave men and women who are in charge of protecting us are up against brutal and uncaring criminals. They are being forced to treat the criminal with sensitivity and regard to protect them from even minor injury.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In light of this, KTCP was developed.<br>\n\nThe methods taught in KTCP are usable by Male and Female, Young and Older, Novice and Experienced equally. There are no set rules on when to use these methods and can be experimented freely as it relates to the needs of the specific agent and situation encountered in the field. This will make it \"real\" as well as integrate it into the Agent's natural responses.<br>\n\nIn Level One of this program we address one human weakness and one reflexive reaction that each Agent must be aware of and integrate into their methodologies.

I am not planning on leaving this Earth anytime soon, but I wanted to try many things in life before I go. I've always wanted to....but either I said no at the opportunity or was too afraid to do so. Partial bucket list: wall climbing, Judo, fencing, zip lines, kayaking, snorkeling, riding on a jet-ski, learning to swim, wall climbing, visiting India, Tibet, Malaysia, Japan, Thailand, and Burma. I've already tried skydiving, tap dancing, Shaolin martial arts, dragon boat racing, skiing, skating, archery, karaoke, fast and high roller coaster rides, walking across an elevated wooden bridge, 5K run, bowling, ping pong, swimming, etc.... There is so much other things I like to try and so many places I've like to visit.

With most of these, you sign-up, get exposed to other singles, and then are expected to figure things out on your own \u2013 the equivalent of being dropped in an unfamiliar place with no compass and being told to find your way home.  \r\n\r\nI know so many people who are serious about dating and looking for the \"one\". Very few are interested in playing the \u201cgames\u201d, but the games always seem to work their way into the picture. \r\n\r\nHere are Some \u201cWhat the _ _ _ _!!!\u201d (insert favorite four letter word) Scenarios:\r\n\r\nExchange emails back and forth for three weeks\u2026 is he (or she) on this dating website to find e-penpals or to go on a date? What the _ _ _ _!!!\r\n\r\nFinally, you both set up a date. The day before, he (or she) cancels and picks a new day for next week. Next week, same thing happens. What the _ _ _!!!\r\n\r\nYou go on the first date \u2013 everything seemed to have gone great! You send a quick note \u201cHad a great time- maybe we can get together again soon\u201d. One problem- you never hear back. What the _ _ _ _!!! \r\n\r\nAny of these scenarios sound familiar? \r\n\r\nSo, how do we simplify this process and cut out the games? What are ladies and\/or guys really looking for? Dating shouldn't have to be a chess match within your own mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo start, I\u2019d like to set up some meet-ups (aka \u201cdating forums\"). The goal: to share the truth and to learn the truth from the source.\r\n\r\nThese events will be held at local establishments and discuss the \u201cdating game\u201d. How do we get to the truth, you wonder? We ask one another - let\u2019s get the female and male perspectives (and some drinks, of course) in one room and see what happens. While this should prove to be wildly entertaining and fun, I\u2019ll bet there\u2019s a wealth of information to be learned from each other! Think of this knowledge as your compass to navigate through the dating scene! \r\n\r\n\r\nLook forward to seeing everybody! \r\nMatt","lon":-73.5400009155,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/1\/d\/highres_9319485.jpeg","photo_id":9319485,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/1\/d\/600_9319485.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/1\/d\/thumb_9319485.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":9824857,"name":"Matt L"},"members":288,"name":"The Truth About Dating","id":1478763,"state":"CT","urlname":"The-Truth-About-Dating","category":{"name":"singles","id":30,"shortname":"singles"},"lat":41.0900001526,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1245817750000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbreeddogs","name":"Small Breed Dogs","id":7929},{"urlkey":"activedogs","name":"Active Dogs","id":9772},{"urlkey":"dogtraining","name":"Dog Training","id":10024},{"urlkey":"williamsburg-brooklyn","name":"Williamsburg, Brooklyn","id":15108},{"urlkey":"greenpoint-brooklyn","name":"Greenpoint, Brooklyn","id":15109},{"urlkey":"dog-play-groups","name":"Dog Playgroups","id":18340},{"urlkey":"puppy-play","name":"Puppy Play","id":22581}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/empireofthedog\/","rating":4.73,"description":"<p><span><strong>Some of our activities are FREE, some benefit animal rescues and some are more formal training and dog sports related classes.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>SUGGEST activities, playgroups and events you'd like to see!

The group consists primarily\u00a0of local girls and women who have\u00a0endured early\u00a0mother loss, and is also open to those who live outside of the immediate area. Events are hosted in the Northern New Jersey area. This group will provide an opportunity to connect with other women who have lost their mothers, share experiences, commiserate together, offer support and hopefully form new friendships.<\/p>\n<p>Since the impact of Motherloss can be very perplexing because the loss is something that changes you forever, the intent of this group is to provide a collaborative, supportive, fun and social experience to its members and to share strategies on how to effectively cope with their loss and celebrate and honor the wisdom that their mothers left behind. We will speak about the past and celebrate the lives of our mothers and the significant role that they played in our lives. More importantly, we will speak about the future, while still carrying our mother's love and support with us. This is a great place to find fun, intelligent, friendly women in the area who can understand what we're each going through.<\/p>\n<p>Each meeting is diverse in the sense that informal social luncheons and dinners at local restaurants are organized, as well as\u00a0optional,\u00a0more interactive meetings, where we can examine and discuss excerpts from books or focus on a general theme or topic of discussion and address several custom questions which can be used to guide you through the bereavement process. We also talk about our lives, families, careers,\u00a0future goals\/aspirations, books we've read, and each members' interests and hobbies.<\/p>\n<p>I hope you can join us each month to have fun and find out how similar our experiences really make us. This group will serve as a safe haven where we will be able to get together, support one another and bond through a shared experience so that we can no longer feel alone in our grief, regardless of which stage we are at in our journey.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>=========================================================================<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">POLICY<\/span>: MEMBERS ARE REQUIRED TO ATTEND A MINIMUM OF FIVE (5) MEETUPS PER CALENDAR YEAR IN ORDER TO REMAIN IN ACTIVE STATUS (OR WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE MEMBERSHIP LIST).<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>=========================================================================<\/p>\n<p><strong>THIS GROUP IS NOT FACILITATED BY A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL AS\u00a0IT'S MERE PURPOSE IS TO SOCIALLY SUPPORT IT'S MEMBERS.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>=========================================================================\u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">NOTE<\/span>:<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<strong>IN AN EFFORT TO PROTECT MEMBER PRIVACY, JOINING UNDER FALSE PRETENSES, FOR SOLICITATION PURPOSES, OR TO COMPILE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF MEMBERS FOR FUTURE SOLICITATION, OR FOR ANY OTHER PERSONAL OR PROFESSIONAL AGENDA, CONSTITUTES UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR AND WILL RESULT IN CANCELLATION OF MEMBERSHIP (ALL INCIDENTS WILL BE REPORTED TO MEETUP.COM).\u00a0 HARASSMENT OR STALKING OF ANY KIND WILL BE IMMEDIATELY REPORTED TO LOCAL GOVERNING AUTHORITIES.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>","lon":-74.2200012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/1\/7\/highres_9811511.jpeg","photo_id":9811511,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/1\/7\/600_9811511.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/1\/7\/thumb_9811511.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":8609064,"name":"Karen"},"members":80,"name":"Northern New Jersey Motherless Daughters","id":1493992,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Northern-New-Jersey-Motherless-Daughters","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Northern NJ Motherless Daughters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Montclair","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1248361398000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"spanish","name":"Spanish Language","id":183},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"bilingual-children","name":"Bilingual Children","id":18676},{"urlkey":"bilingual-multilingual-parents-or-children","name":"Bilingual\/Multilingual Parents or Children","id":20332},{"urlkey":"bilingual-spanish-english","name":"Bilingual Spanish\/English","id":22885}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Montclair-Mamis-y-Papis-Bilingual-Group\/","rating":4.81,"description":"<p>&iexcl;Hola, mam&aacute;s y pap&aacute;s!!!<\/p>\n<p>Mi intenci&oacute;n es formar un grupo integrado por mam&aacute;s y pap&aacute;s biling&uuml;es interesados en que el espa&ntilde;ol, como lengua y como cultura, sea parte de la crianza de sus hijos.<\/p>\n<p>Decid&iacute;

Then I would test their knowledge of Financial Math including % changes (ie. \"What is the % change when a stock moves up $1 from $9?\", \"What is the ROI from an investment where you started it with $1,000 in 2002 and then in 2012, you received $11,000\", \"If an Investment returns 100% when you buy it.. what happens when cannot afford it and you get a partner who puts in 50%?\")<\/p>\n<p>The vast Majority fails to answer these questions correctly and yet they have taken or read MANY classes and Investment Books.<\/p>\n<p>These same students already know that they lack the Math skills. When asked why have they not studied to correct this situation, the Majority of the answers are \"I'm too embarrassed that I don't know the Math (it's really 5th Grade Math),\" \"I am really afraid of Math,\" or \"I have been out of school so long, I forgot it.\"<\/p>\n<p>I will say that if you suspect you do not understand Financial Math (try answering the questions above), have never even bothered to understand how to do any kind of sophisticated calculations (ROI, discounted Cashflow, Internal Rates, etc.), have no knowledge of what kind of Math IS Financial Math... NOT ONLY ARE YOU IN TROUBLE, but you failed to do the RESEARCH necessary to try to Figure out what you DON'T KNOW.<\/p>\n<p>This all points to a LACK OF COURAGE. You have to Research what you don't know and Correct your problems. If you hide the fact that you lack basic math or don't even bother to understand that you lack basic financial math, you are taking the route of the Coward. You are burying your head in the sand. You are setting yourself up for failure.<\/p>\n<p>Worse yet, you are setting yourself up for those that PREY on your lack of knowledge. They will claim that all you need to do is take their course for a huge amount of money (it may not seem huge, but if you DO THE MATH, you will notice how expensive they are on an hourly basis). They give no ASSESSMENT TEST, which is a normal requirement before you would enter any legitimate program like a University. Then, when you pass a certain class, the only requirement that you need is if you have enough money to pay for it. No exam to see whether or not you understood the information. Worse yet, no Math either.<\/p>\n<p>This is a complete failure, not in the programs that take advantage of the student who lacks the Math knowledge, but in the students themselves who refuses to use the GREATEST RESEARCH TOOL OF ALL TIME, the Internet to even bother searching for Financial Math calculations.<\/p>\n<p>Here's a quote from one website I just found:<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>If we were to measure education in the United States purely by how students performed on standardized tests, the results might be labeled: embarrassing<\/strong><\/em>.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Read more:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/financial-edge\/1011\/5-Financial-Math-Skills-Every-Teen-Should-Know.aspx#ixzz23pavFLAC\">http:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/financial-edge\/1011\/5-Financial-Math-Skills-Every-Teen-Should-Know.aspx#ixzz23pavFLAC<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The reality is that you need to be COURAGEOUS in order to admit that you lack Financial Math. You then have to do something about it! This leads to the next Problem:<\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Lack of Discipline<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>First, if you do not know your deficiencies, Discipline won't help you as you can't really correct your problems. So you first have to be Courageous and understand what you lack. Then, you must take a Disciplined Approach to correcting those problems.<\/p>\n<p>Even when I have students in my classes, they have admitted that they lack the Math skills and others types of skills (especially research skills), they fail to do anything BUT attend Class. Even when attending classes, I can see many students just not paying attention, playing on the internet, emailing, flirting, etc.<\/p>\n<p>After class, even though there is a week inbetween classes, they neither study nor even pick up their notes to prepare for the next class.<\/p>\n<p>How can anyone progress reasonably well with such lack of discipline?<\/p>\n<p>Not only that, but they see that I repeat the same lessons again and again, asking me why I am not progressing the class. When I see that the majority of the students have failed to retain the information from the previous class, I just repeat the lessons. In one class, I recalled repeating the same lessons for 5 weeks! And yet they failed to move on.<\/p>\n<p>To be successful, you have to be Disciplined. You have to progress. You have to become sophisticated. You have to treat it as if you are getting a degree in what you are doing, Investing. You have to live, breath and sleep Investing. If you cannot do this, there is a high chance you will not retain the information that you absolutely need to become a good Investor.<\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Lack of Motivation<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Everyone that comes to my classes claim to be MOTIVATED. All the profiles will list Motivation as why they should take my classes to become successful. Yet, 90% of the students will drop out of my classes mainly because I make you do the work necessary to achieve your successes.<\/p>\n<p>If you drop out because it gets tougher, what does that show you about your REAL motivations?<\/p>\n<p>In many cases, I have to say that the only reason why students attend these classes is because they want to have the general feeling that they are doing something. So they take up a seat, have the lack of discipline to pay attention, lack of courage to actually correct their Math problems, sometimes come in late, etc.<\/p>\n<p>YOU ARE JUST NOT MOTIVATED if you cannot progress even though your Mouth may say so.<\/p>\n<p>You can fool yourself, but you cannot fool me. I pretty much know when I have students that are not really Motivated. The vast Majority are not Motivated even though they have claims to be.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><strong>Lack of Thinking and Insight<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The funny thing I always find is that almost all the students NEVER ASK THE QUESTION THAT SHOULD BE ASKED BEFORE EVER TAKING A CLASS.<\/p>\n<p>In order to point this out, I usually ask, \"What is the purpose of going to school?\"<\/p>\n<p>The vast majority of students tell me, \"To get a Degree or to get education.\"<\/p>\n<p>I am absolutely SHOCKED when I hear such questions.<\/p>\n<p>It really shows a lack of Thinking and insight if this is your answer.<\/p>\n<p>No, the reason why you are going to school is to get a JOB which will PAY you MONEY.<\/p>\n<p>This then leads you into the Right QUESTION TO ASK.<\/p>\n<p>So, if my real goal is to get a Job that pays money and the degree is secondary, then what I need to do is MAKE SURE THAT THE EDUCATION INSTITUTE THAT I AM TAKING HAVE GRADUATES THAT MAKE MONEY, not just get a degree!<\/p>\n<p>WOW!!! WHAT INSIGHT!<\/p>\n<p>I am totally shocked that people believe that the purpose of going to school is for an education. IT IS NOT. It's to get you a decent job. If you can't get a decent job then there is no purpose to get the degree, is there?<\/p>\n<p>I know a lot of people who have taken degrees from IVY League schools, and some wind up being baby sitters, waiters\/waitresses, many are now unemployed, etc. What does it matter if you paid a lot of money for a degree and you can't get a job in that field? Worse, you owe $200k or more in Student Loans that you are not allowed to Discharge!! This is a life time of being an Indentured Servant!<\/p>\n<p>The problem is a Lack of Thinking and Insight.<\/p>\n<p>Your main purpose of education is really to MAKE MONEY. This is especially true in regards to INVESTING EDUCATION.<\/p>\n<p>To know if the school you are going to will get you there, you must investigate whether or not the GRADUATES actually MAKE MONEY WITH THE EDUCATION THAT IS BEING TAUGHT!<\/p>\n<p>This is tough to do, but is absolutely ESSENTIAL.<\/p>\n<p>Many of you pluck down 10s of thousands of dollars on Investing Education Courses and yet have no real knowledge if any of the Graduates have really made money. You can't speak to someone and even if they told you they did make money, will they prove it? How do you know they didn't lie to your face?<\/p>\n<p>One of the easiest ways to prove someone made money in Investing is with looking at public documents when they claim Real Estate made them wealthy. Deeds, Mortgages, etc. are generally public information. If you don't get this information first, prove that the instructor actually makes money investing, then you maybe getting the wool pulled over your eyes, and you have spent thousands of dollars getting scammed. I suspect that this is the Majority of Adult Guru education out there.<\/p>\n<p>The funny thing is that while I demonstrate with my own public records and live trading accounts which has made me 100s of thousands of dollars in any given year, still I get a drop out rate of 90% or more.<\/p>\n<p>It seems as though the majority of people are dreaming about living wealthy, but refuse to live the dream!<\/p>\n<p>Maybe this is why all the people who constantly get scammed by education continue to do it. They would really rather dream than living the dream because living the dream is just too hard.<\/p>\n<p>However, after a threshold of knowledge, living the dream becomes extremely easy.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, this Meetup will be shut down as it has done it's job, which was to keep my investing skills and education retained over the 5 years I have been teaching it.<\/p>\n<p>I wish you all luck and should you wish to comment, I am sure others would appreciate it.<\/p>\n<p>Investor Llew<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In 2005 I realized that there will be a multitude of Investors who will not see the flashing Warning signs of disaster up ahead. They were completely ill prepared to read those Warning Signs and therefore will drive their Investment Vehicles into disaster. Now, 4 years later, the wrecked Investment Vehicles are evident everywhere.<\/p>\n<p>That same year, for the specific purpose of educating Investors that they are missing those warning signs, I formed Analyze Business, Inc., an Educational Program which takes you from the very basic to the most advanced topics in Investing. Many other programs claim to Educate correctly, however, those same programs completely fail the Student. They have basically motivated and sent the Student out to a new and dangerous road without teaching the Warning Signs to avoid the obstacles in front of their Investment Vehicle. My program will correct this lack of \"REAL\" Education and expose the problems of other Institutions.<\/p>\n<p>I will also give demonstrations through Public Records of my own transactions such as Deeds, Appraisals, Contract of Sales, Closing Documents, Stock Trading Orders, etc. You will have absolutely no doubt in your mind that these Transactions are real. You will become confident as I produce the education with the documents and techniques.<\/p>\n<p>Since 2005, I have had the opportunity to meet and Educate more than 200 Student Investors with a full range of topics. Many who stayed with my Program found it to be not only enlightening, but also helped them to refrain from making bad investments. Others who only attended sporatically have not fared as well.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to this Meetup Group, I had chosen to keep my program small and accessible via \"word of mouth\" recommendations to capture serious Student Investors. In the process, I have honed my skills in teaching the topic as best and effectively as possible. This Meetup Group is dedicated for the purpose of teaching Investing Skills which I have gained as an Instructor for the past 4 years since 2005.<\/p>\n<p>While the student environment will be serious, you will also see that you will be very comfortable. What is the point of becoming Wealthy if it is not enjoyable?<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><strong>The Curriculum<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<br>\n\n Our Mission is to provide the best Financial Education, PERIOD. We are dedicated to offer our Education Program as inexpensive as possible. Our Current rate is $20 for a 3 hour course, just $6.67 per hour.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Note: Classes are held once a week. So an 8 week course is 8 classes. Sometimes it will take longer as our Classes are taught at the speed of the class.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>1. Future to Beginner Investor (9 weeks) - Your Beginning<\/strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n Although you may have an MBA, work in a Financial Company, hold a CPA or Accounting Degree, etc., you must start at the Beginning.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n If it were that an MBA, CPA, Accounting Degree, etc. guaranteed that you would be a successful Investor, then anyone holding one of those Degrees would be successful. While I believe those Degrees can be helpful, I have not seen a correlation between any Degree and a Successful Investor.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>1. a) Return on Investment (ROI) - 3 Weeks<\/strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n An Introduction to Excel and ROI.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Most Investors really don't understand how to Calculate an ROI, especially a Multi-year ROI. You will be taught to calculate ROI's for less than a year, a year, and multi-years. You will also start to learn the true meaning of Cashflow. Again, another problem with most Investors, normally Real Estate Investors. Real Estate Investors seem to think that the Cashflow of a property only has to do with the Income of a Property. That is incorrect.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n This portion finishes with a test on Multi-year ROI. Once you pass this exam, your status will change from a Future Investor to a Beginner Investor.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>1. b) Basic Business Model - 6 weeks<\/strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n You will start to use Excel's more complicated features by building your own Analytical Tool. The Tool will be specialized for Real Estate, but it can be Customized to any Business. There are several sections: General Information, Base Rate and Points, Payment Calculation, Loan Amortization, Revenues, Expenses, Depreciation and Financial Calculations including Cashflow, Cap Rate, Net Income, etc.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n This portion finishes with a comprehensive Excel exam. Once you pass this exam, your status changes from a Beginner Investor to an Intermediate Investor.<strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n 2. Intermediate Investor (6 Weeks)<\/strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n You will now hone your Financial and Excel Skills in order to build a much more sophisticated and comprehensive Business Model. You will include Calulations for pro-rated 1st year analysis, Pre-Payments, and project your Analysis to 10 years out.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>3. Advanced Investor (4 weeks)<\/strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n You will learn to build a Business Plan.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>About Me<br>\n\n<br>\n\n ---------<\/p>\n<p>I have been an Investor since 1998, approximately 12 years, purchasing and owning several multi-family Investment Properties in New York City as well as active in the Stock Market. All of my Investment Properties are doing Excellent, are fully Cashflowing and makes an exceptional return.<\/p>\n<p>I have Invested in the Stock Market for over a Decade. Although the vast Majority of Investors have lost approximately 50% of their investments recently, I am currently returning more than 50% Annual Return on Investment (ROI) through various techniques in both Options and Stock trading techniques. All of which I will be teaching, proving and presenting in class.<\/p>\n<p>I have also worked for the Federal Reserve Bank for 3 years as well as many of the top 10 Financial Companies in the world including Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) and Merrill Lynch.<\/p>\n<p>In 2003, my Net Worth exceeded a Million Dollars. I left the Rat Race and became a full time Investor, completely financially free, never having to work again.<\/p>\n<p>If you feel that you are a serious Student looking for an Educator with my Skill and Experience, then I welcome you to join my Meetup Group.<\/p>\n<p>It is the mission of Analyze Business, Inc. which I founded, to provide the best Investment Education possible for dirt cheap to the General Public that will be completely clear and understandable. The Goal is to teach you to Drive your Investment Vehicle without crashing it.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the Curriculum includes:<\/p>\n<p>Understanding basic and complicated Financial Analyticals such as Rate of Return, Cashflow, Discounted Cashflow, Cap Rate, Yields, Net Operating Income (NOI), Return on Investment (ROI), etc.<\/p>\n<p>You will learn to build a very sophisticated Excel Tool which will preform Analyticals on Investments such as Investment Properties and Corporations.<\/p>\n<p>Economics such as the Economic Indicators like Unemployment, Housing Starts, Housing Inventory, Home Sales, Home Prices, Consumer Pride Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), both Core and non-Core (the Headline), etc. Economic Topics such as \"Flight to Quality,\" Leading and Lagging Indicators, Government Policy changes, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Tax Strategies are absolutely important. Without a good understanding of Taxes, you cannot understand your true Cashflow or your Rate of Return. This is commonly called the After Tax Cashflow (ATCF) and the After Tax Rate of Return (ATROR).

Having a tough time getting enough of your friends to go paintballing? Then join us! This group is meant for those who enjoy being outdoors, making new friends, playing paintball, and above all having fun. We accept players of all experience levels, so as long as you're interested, we would be thrilled to have you join our events! As a heads up, most of our players are average, casual or new players.<br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : medium\">Our goal is to also create a community of organizers as well so we can have a consistent number of group events throughout the year without having to put the burden of organizing on the shoulders of the same few people every time. There will be times where us organizers will just want to play at events than rather organize one; in those instances other organizers can step up to the plate and carry the torch. So if you're interested in organizing an event feel free to contact any of the co-organizers of this group.<br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : medium\">This group is open to new and experienced players.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : medium\">Girls and Guys, 18 or older.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Younger players must be accompanied by a legal guardian.<\/span> <span style=\"font-size : medium\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : small\"><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PREPARATION &amp; WHAT YOU SHOULD WEAR:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>* Bring a beat-up pair of boots or high-top sneakers. We will be walking\/hiking through the woods for most of the day.<\/p>\n<p>* Wear 2-3 layers of shirts for extra protection and a thick pair of leggings, sweats, dickie coveralls etc. I've seen people wear snowboarding pants or hockey shorts (on top of their pants) for extra protection.&nbsp; I will likely have a t-shirt, long sleeve thermal plus another long sleeve military camo shirt and pants. If not you can always rent coveralls from skirmish for about $8 and wear it on top of your clothes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>* Bring a hoodie or skullie (or both) for extra protection of your head. The rental masks provided only provide coverage of your face from slightly below your chin to slightly above your forehead.<\/p>\n<p>* Bring thin gloves (baseball batting gloves are perfect) to protect your hands &amp; knuckles.<\/p>\n<p>* Bring extra money for food, upgrades and accessories. Beyond the minimum $100 you will spend on admission, bus and paintballs, as a new player, you may want to look into upgrading your gun for an additional $20 or buying gloves, neck protector or coveralls. You can also visit your local paintball shops if you wish to buy &amp; learn about this stuff before arriving to Skirmish. You can also visit Skirmish.com or call them for pricing on these items.<\/p>\n<p>* As a recommendation to the new players who are willing to make some extra investments for this trip; I would invest in a full head paintball mask which can range from $30-$50, gloves (paintball &amp; baseball batting gloves practically the same thing) and a neck protector. It's Worth the investment in my opinion if you see yourself paintballing again in the future.<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/3\/d\/d\/highres_28449181.jpeg","photo_id":28449181,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/3\/d\/d\/600_28449181.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/3\/d\/d\/thumb_28449181.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":32934562,"name":"Jabari Osaze"},"members":696,"name":"NY\/NJ Paintball Meetup","id":1524144,"state":"NJ","urlname":"nypaintball","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.8300018311,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Ramsey","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1253047281000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"rawfood","name":"Raw Food","id":1983},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"living-foods","name":"Living Foods","id":17440},{"urlkey":"childrens-health-and-nutrition","name":"Children's Health and Nutrition","id":26929},{"urlkey":"raw-potlucks","name":"Raw Potlucks","id":28231},{"urlkey":"raw-food-preparation","name":"Raw Food Preparation","id":29659},{"urlkey":"vegan-potlucks-and-dineouts","name":"Vegan Potlucks and Dineouts","id":74670}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-Jersey-Raw-Food-Support\/","rating":4.9,"description":"<p>The New Jersey Raw Food Support Network was started to provide health and nutrition information for the raw food lifestyle in New Jersey.

Current membership is approximately 260-270. Joining this group and joining the club are not the same thing. CJSC is a non-profit club. We do enjoy sharing the passion for skiing and snowboarders with others who share this interest. RSVP\u2019ing here is just a way of telling other meetup group members that you plan to attend an event but in the case of trips, you must contact the Trip Leader to formally register. One of the CJSC's greatest features is our weekend bus trips! What better way to go skiing in Vermont and New England than when you don't have to drive yourself?

One can initially join as guest of, and\/or by invitation from regular members. Guest members will become full members once they have done two major day hikes with us and have shown great interest with the group, or will be taken out if inactive after a certain period.<\/p>\n<p>Bear in mind that our major hikes are moderate to strenuous, with a rise of 1,000ft or more, and a total distance of at least 6miles. You must have good hiking experience or are working to promote your skills so you can enjoy our hikes and get rewarded with those amazing sights.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that a more connected membership generates more goodwill and fun for all. And we would like to grow that way. We will limit the group size to promote group cohesiveness.

Physicians. If you want to network, have fun or relax this is the group for you. Doctors who would like to meet for brunch, lunch and dinner should contact each other. \r\n\r\nMembership\r\n\r\nYou must post a picture of yourself and answer the questions to be approved. If you have a website or office information please feel free to include it in your profile. The questions aid in allowing people to get to know you better. You might live in the same neighborhood, work in similar fields or share alumni associations. Those with children can arrange play dates. \r\n\r\nAnswering the questions also helps to protect us from people joining who aren't physicians or who want to spam the group with information about their business\/ products.  \r\n\r\n\r\nRSVP\r\n\r\nIf you invite your friends who are physicians please add them in your rsvp.  Some venues are smaller and more intimate than others.  If an event is posted for a health fair with free dinner and an open bar if 10 of us rsvp then only the 10 of us should appear that day.  Please keep that in mind and be considerate. \r\n\r\nIf you rsvp yes and can no longer attend an event please change your rsvp to no.  We are busy and when an emergency arises I do not expect anyone to log on to meetup and change an rsvp to no before handling the situation.  However, I always ask for a contact number if you rsvp yes and I call everyone before an event to ensure they are coming.   \r\n\r\nPlease do not rsvp yes without a contact number.  Any yes rsvp without a contact number will not be honored. \r\n\r\nIf there is an event you will not be able to attend please rsvp no.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertisement \r\n\r\nI want everyone to feel free to participate and add anything they find to the group. If I know of any free CME, health care forum, dinners, volunteer event or expose I will post it.

We are a ski club run for members by members. Our club motto is \"Think Snow\" - we do all the time! But just because we don't get snow year round doesn't mean we stop. Our foundation is built around snow-sports and the winter, but our club is active all year round. On season we run plenty of weekend trips to resorts in the Northeast and several week long trips out West or to Europe. Off season we don't stop- hiking, biking, happy hours, beach meet-ups and socializing are just a few of our activities. Our members are active men and women who live in the NJ\/NY area. The majority of our members are in their 20's &amp; 30's. (While we have no age limits, you do have to be 21 to join.) Whether you're a skier, snowboarder, or just like social activities, our club has something for you. Unlike some other ski clubs where you must attend every meeting, volunteer for duties, be voted in by nomination, etc...We do none of that. We realize everyone has their own lives and a busy schedule. Come to our meetings as often as you like, or as little as your schedule permits. Our $35 membership give you access to all activities year round and a great group of people.

I've recently found that my single friends have slowly diminished. I love living in Hoboken and all the area has to offer. Though there are groups out there that focus on meeting people, I think one specific to being a single woman and getting out and meeting people locally is something that will resonate with others. While other groups are always good to meet all kinds of people in large groups, I hope to keep most events smaller and a bit more intimate allowing us to connect and develop friendships as well as meet new people! I hope to plan low key happy hours, evenings out, brunches and other activities here in Hoboken. There is no way you are going to meet anyone sitting on the couch!

So I decide to create one.<\/p>\n<p>This group is aimed to provide a platform to create active sports events for active fit Asian Americans, mostly FREE or at a bargain group rate price. This group is for young Asian professionals to enjoy active, and adventurous activties in group setting and make friends in the process. The group has age range from 20s to 30s to keep this group active and strong. Exceptions will be given to those who can demonstrate some extraordinary athletic abilities.<\/p>\n<p>The main activies include:<br>\n\n adventures, outdoor and sport\ufffdactivities, skiing, snowboarding, ice-skating, alpine skiing, downhill skiing, figure skating, ice dancing, roller-blading\/skating, badminton, table tennis (ping pong), archery, tennis, volleyball, swimming, biking, hiking, zip-Line, adventure courses, paintball, kayaking, bowling, fitness, gym, golf, fencing, whitewater rafting, camping, rock-climbing, sports and recreation, and more ...<\/p>\n<p>Some more adventurous events to try:<br>\n\n sky-diving, scuba-diving, wave surfing, wind surfing, paragliding, parasailing, horse-back riding & etc. (will update this) ...<\/p>\n<p>We will try to complement these events with breakfasts\/lunches\/dinners when possible. Hey, we all need energy to be active, right?<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, we can join some laid back events like museums, movies, concerts, clubings, karaoke, travels, and Chinese (Mandarin & Cantonese), Taiwanese, Korean, Japanese and other Asians culture events etc so we can enjoy other aspects of life too.<\/p>\n<p>So, all active Asian Americans, let's keep an active and healthy life style. Join this group and let's create fun active sporting events, and enjoy the life to its fullness together!!!<\/p>\n<p>P.S.

In NYC, there are approximately 100,000 filmmakers, 60,000 actors, 250 acting schools, and countless film students. Most of them still take classes, send resumes, work temp jobs, check Craigslist, and wait for their BIG BREAK.  Our mission is simple: Network, Share, and Educate.  We bring together filmmakers, producers, directors, actors, writers, cameramen, and editors to share their experience, polish their skills, and help each other through networking events, seminars and workshops.   Filmmaking is a collaborative process, and we are here to foster and nurture that collaboration. With so many filmmakers and actors in NYC who work from big budget movies to student films, this group aims to give you an edge in the congested world of New York filmmaking.  Through a series of events, we&rsquo;ll cover every part of the filmmaking process; some with guest speakers, others in production facilities, but all aiming to bring our professional experience and knowledge to our members, and build a network of talented filmmakers and performers.

The Lectorium Rosicrucianum, or International School of the Golden Rosycross, aims to help seekers find and form a living connection with this shining filament, which is woven of love, wisdom, knowledge (gnosis) and action. Most importantly, this golden thread is a Path that can actually be walked, a Path shown by all religions in their original form. No Master or Initiate can give the Truth to another. It can only be approached by our own efforts, and by persevering throughout all the obstructions and difficulties we encounter on the way. And it can only be reached through an inner process of transformation called 'soul-rebirth', or 'transfiguration'. A bonafide School points out the Path of transfiguration and teaches its pupils how to follow it. It is not the I-central self, or personality, that profits from the process of transfiguration as meant here, but the inner, divine Self, which is awakened and enababled to become increasingly active. This has tremendous results for the personality: he or she becomes an instrument, a servant, of another Order, the Divine Order, the 'kingdom not of this world', and in that state is able to stand right in the midst of the world in the service of every human being. The Lectorium Rosicrucianum is a modern organization in the sense that its message is adapted to the strongly individualized consciousness of twentieth and twenty-first century humanity. However, it has deep roots in the past, for it is part of the long and ancient tradition of Mystery Schools, and is a development of earlier impulses of spiritual awakening such as those of the gnostics, Albigenses, Cathars and classical Rosicrucians of the 17th century.<\/p>\n<p>You can learn more about us on our web site www.goldenrosycross.org, or if you download the brochure in the file section!<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/2\/3\/3\/highres_435465619.jpeg","photo_id":435465619,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/2\/3\/3\/600_435465619.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/2\/3\/3\/thumb_435465619.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10885463,"name":"Marie-Rose Nduku"},"members":180,"name":"Lectorium Rosicrucianum - New York City","id":1557849,"state":"NY","urlname":"goldenrosycross-NYC","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1258483680000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"jazz","name":"Jazz","id":131},{"urlkey":"musicians","name":"Musicians","id":173},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"livemusic","name":"Live Music","id":8652},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"brooklyn","name":"Brooklyn","id":16794},{"urlkey":"contemporary-jazz-enthusiasts","name":"Contemporary jazz enthusiasts","id":19799}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Jazz\/","rating":4.25,"description":"<p>This group is for those who love to partake in live music, especially jazz, and in the Brooklyn area.

Organizers are charged a fee to maintain their meet-ups. So, after careful consideration, and talking to other gaming groups, here is what I've decided to do. $5.00 for the whole year (membership) OR $1 per event\/per person(guest).

Come join us for friendly casual group runs through out the week. Lets train for something! New to NYC, we will also educate you on the different events and running clubs NYC has to offer. The group's primary purpose and vision is to allow runners of all endurance levels, paces, distances and months or years of running experience to run together in a non-competitive atmosphere and to get to know each other through a variety of social activities. Runs will be scheduled all throughout the week as well as weekends at various locations (both morning and evening) . Each run is open to any runner regardless of experience. It is highly suggested that you review the description of the run and determine whether or not it is right for you. Each run leader\/organizer is experienced with the courses and can alter the course pending who is out there and what each runner is interested in. If you wish to join a run, please state in your RSVP the distance and pace that you project you might be interested in. This will allow the organizer to get feedback from the interested runners.

At that time, Crowley met with various masons and met who would become the first priest of his Order, Don Jesus Medina.<br>\n\nThe concept was simple and beautiful, and marked the beginning of Crowley&rsquo;s personal development in this journey that culminated in what we know today as the &ldquo;Vision and the Voice&rdquo;. This journey ends with the spiritual stage of inner light: The Lamp.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nThe Congregation of the Lamp of Invisible Light intent is to keep this Light available and ready for those who are in need of it by continuing with Crowley's concept in a new form. The Light never went out.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nThe Central Ritual incorporates techniques based on the Cube of Space (a cabalistic model for the Universe) and other Hermetic teachings. It is a participatory ritual and has a deep impact to open our inner self to the energies of the present Aeon.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nFurthermore, the Congregation of the Lamp of Invisible Light aligns itself with the principles of Thelema, the teachings in the Book of the Law and its message of Life, Light, Liberty and Love.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nLove is the law, love under will<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/b\/9\/highres_25841401.jpeg","photo_id":25841401,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/b\/9\/600_25841401.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/b\/9\/thumb_25841401.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":2301408,"name":"Juan"},"members":178,"name":"The Congregation of the Lamp of Invisible Light","id":1561494,"state":"NY","urlname":"lampofinvisiblelight","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Thelemites"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1259102527000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newmedia","name":"New Media","id":1851},{"urlkey":"new-york","name":"New York","id":18312},{"urlkey":"digital-marketing","name":"Digital Marketing","id":22773},{"urlkey":"augmented-reality","name":"Augmented Reality","id":26061}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ARNY-Augmented-Reality-New-York\/","rating":4.74,"description":"Augmented Reality (AR) will one day change the way we interact with the world. \r\n\r\nAR technology has come a long way and is now ready for the market.

This time join a gathering of Uptowners who are into checking out art and culture together in Harlem and other Uptown enclaves, for more community, connection and conversation, now while going around and seeing good stuff in the neighborhood together.<\/p>\n<p>From Jazz at the Triple Nickel, and keeping up with what's going on at the Schomberg Center, to checking out whatever they're showing at Maysles and the Thalia... we'll step into creaking old galleries in garden levels of brownstones -which I swear tell stories with that creaking alone, if you listen closely enough- and raw spaces with installations which require some of us to strain our brains a bit extra to tap into their avant garde messages;  venture to quirky bookshops, and cultural centers tucked away here and there, offering what sometimes seems like a hodge podge of open-mic odysseys, hip-hop inspired psychedelia, meditation of any spiritual tradition you can think of, 'raw' soul food, all and sundry other kinds of poetry, prose and social commentary in the footsteps of any number of greats but reinterpreted for 2010; and try to connect with the many other patches of emerging cultural expression springing up all the time all around us, which are so easy to miss in the bustle of city living.<\/p>\n<p>Uptown Happenings Together (NYC) is about staying in the neighborhood a little more, slowing down and engaging a little more. Trying to connect with a few new people who may be into some of the same things; and getting a little closer to the pulse of all that good energy we sometimes lose touch with, while going to and fro' and up and down at a dizzying pace just trying to live in this wonderful but often frenetic and decidedly hulking city.. <br><\/br> <br><\/br> <br><\/br>Small print-----&gt; Besides a one-time joining contribution of $5, most group events will be 'free' to sign up for.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, events which require prior ticket purchase, group deposit, reservation of space or extensive pre-event organizing, will require pre-payment to cover cost of tickets, etc., and a small organizing fee ($2\/person) at time of RSVP.<\/p>\n<p>Special fund raising events may also be organized for which there would be slightly more substantial fees collected, to go to established and well-run charities or causes.<\/p>","lon":-73.9400024414,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/9\/3\/a\/highres_12086938.jpeg","photo_id":12086938,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/9\/3\/a\/600_12086938.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/9\/3\/a\/thumb_12086938.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":9256546,"name":"Alba"},"members":35,"name":"Uptown Happenings Together (NYC)","id":1565682,"state":"NY","urlname":"Uptown-Happenings-Together-NYC","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Uptown Culture Lovers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1260339014000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"rock-music","name":"Rock Music","id":21048},{"urlkey":"alternative-music","name":"Alternative Music","id":24221},{"urlkey":"classic-rock","name":"Classic Rock","id":24659},{"urlkey":"jethro-tull","name":"Jethro Tull","id":65311}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Jethro-Tull\/","rating":4.85,"description":"A group of loyal Jethro Tull fans and followers who enjoy getting together to listen to some great music and throw back a few cold ones.

Our purpose is to create a support network for women exploring polyamory, or dealing with their individual poly situations.<\/p>\n<p>At most poly gatherings, men outnumber women and typically dominate the conversation. The founders saw a need for a group less focused on meeting potential dates and more on providing informed and sympathetic emotional support for our sometimes challenging lovestyle.<\/p>\n<p>Our members are women of all ages and include straight, bisexual, transgender, lesbian and pansexual women. That said, the group's purpose is to discuss polyamory from the female perspective, so we are only open to persons living as women.<\/p>\n<p>We are open to all women who are polyamorous, poly-friendly, poly-curious, poly-pending or poly-questioning.

We play a competitive and physical form of Flag Football. However, we all do know that we aren't getting paid to play football&nbsp;and we're not in the NFL. The difference between us and other&nbsp;games is that we maintain a balance between both.&nbsp;Our games are fun and competitive,&nbsp; but&nbsp;we don't take the game too seriously like others.&nbsp;The important rule to follow here is sportsmanship. Just treat other players with respect and you'll be fine.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>This group is for people in NYC that like to play Football but don't want to pay the fees associated with joining a league. The first thing you should know about this game is that its FREE! There is no membership cost and the only fee I might collect is to update our equipment or help pay for this website fee. Its basically an old school weekly pick-up football game that's a lot more organized. Ages of members range from 25-40 yrs old. The Sat game is pretty much all guys.<\/p>\r\n<p>I've been organizing a regular flag football game in Queens for the past 4 years and we already have a solid group of regulars that play. However, I thought it was time for me to make a meetup group to make recruiting much easier for us. I know there are people out there in NYC that love to play football but don't want to pay any fee or deal with some of the drama or obligations associated with other leagues. Read the \"About Us\" page for general info and game rules.<\/p>\r\n<p>This weekly game has been going on almost year round for the most part and games are played in rain or shine.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us. Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs. Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process. Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life. Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you. Discover the passion and power that resides within you Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down. You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose. Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies. Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/5\/6\/highres_403753142.jpeg","photo_id":403753142,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/5\/6\/600_403753142.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/5\/6\/thumb_403753142.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7098834,"name":"Ben Oofana"},"members":1365,"name":"Awaken the Healing Power Within Your Body  and Mind","id":1574661,"state":"NY","urlname":"awakenthehealingpower","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1262215749000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"java","name":"Java","id":189},{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"webdesign","name":"Web Design","id":659},{"urlkey":"ruby","name":"Ruby","id":1040},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript","id":7029},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"internetpro","name":"Internet Professionals","id":10102},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"technology","name":"Technology","id":10579},{"urlkey":"web-performance","name":"Web Performance","id":15091},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"tech-talks","name":"Tech Talks","id":91146}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Tech-Talks\/","rating":4.57,"description":"<p>The purpose of this Meetup Group is to gather local NYC area techies together to learn from one another.

It was pretty amazing. Like when the constellations changed their shapes as we zoomed out, and the constellations all ended up pointing at the Sun.<\/p>\n<p>I have a Ph.D in Astronomy under Carl Sagan. I am also passionate about sharing the wonders of the universe. \u00a0The audience is small, but passionate as well.\u00a0 And the questions are all over the place, displaying different levels of understanding.\u00a0The best questions are often the least informed.\u00a0 But if you're well informed, you'll become even more well informed.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes there are spirited lectures and discussions\u00a0about Life, the Universe and Everything (ref: Douglas Adams). I like to do that. The material is endless, and the lectures\u00a0are weekly. You will be engaged an any level you want, and your remarks and questions are always considered to be important.<\/p>\n<p>The lectures are held, weekly,\u00a0at the Council Senior Center, on Tuesdays, at 12:45pm, at 241 W 72st.\u00a0 If you'd like to add your name to a list of people who would come in\u00a0to an\u00a0evening class, drop me an email.\u00a0 The director of the center has agreed to not charge for the\u00a0first month.\u00a0 After that the fee is $72 for the year.\u00a0\u00a0 I am 67, and generally well ahead of you on the curve towards dissolution.

In the 20th century, She was reclaimed by some Pagans and feminists as a more positive figure, representing female independence, sexuality, and vehement opposition to tyranny. Some other modern occultists revere Her simply as a chthonic figure, rather than as a revolutionary. We aim to honor Lilith in all Her aspects.<\/p>\n<p>We expect that most of our members will also belong to other spiritual groups that revere other deities. This group is not intended to provide a complete religion for its members, but rather to bring people together from a variety of polytheistic and occult paths who revere Lilith.<\/p>\n<p>For more information, please see our \"About\" page: http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Lilith-NYC\/about\/ .<\/p>\n<p>We will try to schedule our meetings so as not to conflict with those of any NYC Pagan, polytheistic, or occult groups that we are aware of.

Yoga is not a question of information but of transformation. It is not to be practiced, but to be lived.<\/p>\n<p>As a consequence, the aim of yoga lies not in increasing the volume of our &ldquo;much&mdash;informed ignorance&rdquo;, but in changing our life. Yoga creates a space within us for Pure Consciousness to be able to flow through every expression, movement, glance, thought, emotion and word.<\/p>\n<p>To inquire into the origins of yoga, it is indispensible to refer to the sacred scriptures of Hinduism.<\/p>\n<p>Yoga is not an invention. It was not constructed by the limited and imperfect mind of a human being, but arose from revelation. Due to their purity, the sages of antiquity could easily access higher and subtler levels of consciousness, until they directly perceived that plane which is called veda or &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo;. The original Vedas are Shabda&mdash;brahman, that is, the Truth that exists eternally as a sound vibration at a certain dimension of consciousness. The enlightened sages, called Rishis or &ldquo;seers&rdquo;, knew how to channel this transcendental, eternal wisdom, and so they served as veritable bridges between humanity and the Divine, between the human being and the Transcendental, by orally transmitting the major portion of that wisdom.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ramakrishnananda.com\/en\/swami-ramakrishnananda\/\" target=\"_blank\">Swami Ramakrishnananda<\/a><br><\/br><br><\/br>Founder of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ramakrishnananda.com\" target=\"_blank\">Vishwa Dharma Mandalam<\/a><\/p>\n<p><br><\/br><br><\/br> \n<object width=\"718\" height=\"428\">\n<embed type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"718\" height=\"428\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/25-z_-qd3b4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\" style=\"max-height : 700px ;

They play the music  they want, not what is determined by what sells.\r\n\r\n Venues that I like are Maxwells in Hoboken, local bars in the Newark Area and Asbury Lanes in Asbury Park. \r\n The purpose of this meetup is to bring together the people that enjoy learning new things and have a passion for music.\r\nIf you are interested in meeting music lovers like yourself, join us!\r\nThanks,\r\nKristina","lon":-74.1800003052,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/f\/2\/5\/highres_12816645.jpeg","photo_id":12816645,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/f\/2\/5\/600_12816645.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/f\/2\/5\/thumb_12816645.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7539651,"name":"Phinnegan"},"members":466,"name":"Central Jersey Music Lovers Group","id":1588616,"state":"NJ","urlname":"njmusic","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.6599998474,"who":"NJ music lovers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Hoboken","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1264541291000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"trivia","name":"Trivia","id":1373},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"drinking","name":"Drinking","id":15546},{"urlkey":"new-jersey","name":"New Jersey","id":15569},{"urlkey":"games","name":"Games","id":15992},{"urlkey":"pubs-bars","name":"Pubs and Bars","id":19195},{"urlkey":"social-games","name":"Social Games","id":23103},{"urlkey":"pub-trivia","name":"Pub Trivia","id":28726},{"urlkey":"morris-county","name":"Morris County","id":44855}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Northern-NJ-Trivia-Meetup-Group\/","rating":4.83,"description":"<p>Anybody can have a beer and play along at one of the quiz nights in Hoboken, Jersey City, or Morristown... but we're here because we play for fun AND we play to win!<\/p>\r\n<p>We know we're smart and a few drinks later, we're even smarter.

One of the authors, Ben Winters, had written \"Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monster\"' published by Quirk Classics. I admit that I had read \"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\" by the same publisher and had no desire to read another work from their publishing house.<\/p>\n<p>During the Q&amp;A session, Ben Winters confessed\u00a0to an audience mostly comprised of the Jane Austen Society of North America that he had actually disliked Jane Austen in school and wrote his book to appeal to a larger audience. What caught my attention was an audience member who had read the book asked him to confirm the HP Lovecraft references in the book. (HP Lovecraft?!). He affirmed this,\u00a0adding\u00a0that other influences for the book included Jules Verne and Robert Louis Stevenson.<\/p>\n<p>This intrigued me and yes I did go \"Hmmmm..\"\u00a0 buying the book that same day and devouring it over the weekend.<\/p>\n<p>That experience taught me to keep an open mind and inspired me to create this book club.<\/p>\n<p>As Ben wrote when he autographed my copy \"Come on in, the water's fine..\"<\/p>\n<p>*2012<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/1\/a\/8\/highres_12908616.jpeg","photo_id":12908616,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/1\/a\/8\/600_12908616.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/1\/a\/8\/thumb_12908616.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3198499,"name":"Hazel"},"members":2010,"name":"Books that Make You Go Hmmm...","id":1592470,"state":"NY","urlname":"HmmmBooks","category":{"name":"literature\/writing","id":18,"shortname":"literature-writing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Bibliophiles"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1265066392000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Free-Yoga-Workshops-and-Worldwide-Adventure-Travel\/","rating":4.77,"description":"<p>I started this group when I was in NYC a few years ago.<\/p>\n<p>Now based back in Sydney, Australia, I decided to keep this group alive, as my NY is very dear to my heart...... so we can meet on retreat!<\/p>\n<p>This group is both for seasoned yogis and fitness lovers who love to travel and desire <span>to&nbsp;bring more spiritual depth to their&nbsp;lives in a powerful and very practical way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I plan to revisit NY in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>In case you have itchy feet, I will post up my upcoming Yoga Adventures and Spiritual Retreats shortly!<\/p>\n<p>Feel free to&nbsp;email me&nbsp;with questions and any creative suggestions. <br> <br> In &nbsp;Inspiration, Love &nbsp;and Gratitude<\/p>\n<p>Mirella <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> Awareness Adventures ...

I am a trained psychic detective, medium, medical intuitive, paranormal investigator and energy healer.  I am also an attorney, specialized in securities litigation, and have a special appreciation for logic, reason and evidence. I graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University and cum laude on Law Review from Pace University School of Law.  I love evidence!  I do not want to \"preach to the choir\" - I prefer to teach to those who are intrigued by this field but require some form of rational proof that it is real or who have doubts that they have any psychic abilities.  Skepticism is nothing more than another way of asking questions.  Curiosity and discipline are the only two prerequisites for these classes.  Once you join the New York City Skeptical Psychics Society Meetup Group, you will be sent the information about the times and location for the workshops held in Manhattan and other nearby locations.  Each workshop costs $30 and  you are not obligated to attend all workshops.

This group was started as a place to find other people who want to learn about wine and food in a casual, fun, and stimulating setting.&nbsp; This is not a dating or pick-up group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We meet at least once per month at a local venue that allows us to bring our own&nbsp;wine. There are so many great places in NYC that are BYO\/BYOB we can enjoy wine and food in a casual, fun, interesting, affordable atmosphere. We&nbsp; have access&nbsp;to great wine and we are always looking to enjoy it with like minded people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The group was founded by Vicente Pina, a wine educator, wine writer, and former retailer. He created a group that was relaxed and focused on enjoying wine without being pompous or intimidating.&nbsp; When Vince left for a job opportunity in the Northwest, the members wanted to continue the group, so Dan Goroff and Jeff M, two amateur wine lovers, have taken over as organizers with support from other members.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Our aim is to promote the love of wine by providing other wine lovers the chance to learn about the wonderful world of wine and sample world-class vino as we socialize and meet a diverse group of people with similar interests. Our primary emphasis is to have fun by fusing these three activities - enjoying wine, food and meeting interesting people. The venues of our meetings will generally be BYO\/BYOB places whenever possible, that also offer to great food and ambiance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We taste wines from all over the world that have been rated by The Wine Advocate, International Wine Cellars, Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiast magazines, James Halliday, Jancis Robinson, and other renowned experts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Everyone is welcome! From new people to wine, to long time wine lovers. So lets join up and have fun meeting and mingling while indulging in three of life's most satisfying pleasures - PEOPLE, WINE &amp; FOOD.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>One final key point, the purpose of our events is for you, our members, to enjoy wine, food and friendship in a relaxed environment.&nbsp; It is even more important that you get home safely from the event.

I hold a master's degree in mental health counseling and am a certified holistic health coach. I have over 10 years of experience leading women's groups and coaching women who are looking for support in achieving personal goals, improving self-esteem and body image, and increasing opportunities for more satisfying relationships (dating\/family\/friendships). In addition, I specialize in working with women who have genital herpes. I know how difficult it is to find accurate information and good doctors, as well as the challenge to rebuild your self-esteem after a diagnosis. I am passionate about seeing women overcome these challenges, and the many women I have worked with over the years have discovered confidence again and have entered into great relationships.<\/p>\n<p>In this group, we will sort through the facts about herpes and you will have an opportunity to get updated and accurate information about herpes. We will discuss body image, relationships, social stigmas and how all of these things uniquely affect you.<\/p>\n<p>But we won't stop there. Genital herpes is only one part of your life. I have been hosting women's groups for a number of years and all women deal with challenges to their self-esteem, frustrations and disappointments in the dating world, questions about their career path, and joy in their achievements. This group will offer a structured environment with weekly topics that will provide you an opportunity to discuss these issues, process and solve the problems related, and find inspiration and motivation to move forward. Most importantly, you will be able to connect and share with other women in a safe space where you can also discuss your concerns about genital herpes.<\/p>\n<p>If you have genital herpes, or your partner has genital herpes, please inquire for information about being a part of a group. The group meets on the 2nd &amp; 4th Sunday each month. The group is $100 every 2 months. There will be no charge for the first meeting. Please come out and see what it is all about.

To discuss symptoms (and how they effect our jobs, activities and relationships), moods, medications, natural solutions, and treatments in a group that attempts to be as neutral and positive as possible. And maybe even make some new bipolar friends.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nI started this group because I was dissatisfied with other groups I had joined in the past. Certain discussions at such group(s) seemed to veer off into inappropriate debates of an offensive and accusatory socio-political nature, including unnecessarily bringing up inflammatory topics, cultural\/ethnic\/societal issues, political affiliations, etc. Many seemed set up to be a personal social club for the organizer, with an atmosphere that favored a core group of people who had been in the group longest.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nI am not a psychologist\/psychiatrist or an expert (although I do read articles on the topic whenever I can), but I do promise to bring my most supportive and neutral self to the group. I would expect others to do the same, particularly due to the vulnerable and sensitive nature of the group and disorder.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nOn a side note, I do not believe in censorship, and I am all for people having informal conversations (about love, relationships, jobs, art, etc), but I would encourage people to stay away from divisive ones like politics and cultural debates. Bipolar people cannot afford to have their day (and mood) ruined by people attempting to exploit the group to further their own personal agendas, demean certain &ldquo;groups&rdquo; of people, or use the group as a debate club or an extension of a political party. Those conversations are, by their very nature, animosity provoking in others, emotionally intense and upsetting (especially for bipolar people), and therefore counter-productive to the purpose of the group, which is to be a healing and supportive force in people's lives.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nIf you want to meet with a group that does it's best to maintain an environment of neutrality and support and STAYS ON TOPIC by not encouraging divisive political or cultural conversations, join this!<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/3\/9\/highres_14413113.jpeg","photo_id":14413113,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/3\/9\/600_14413113.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/3\/9\/thumb_14413113.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":4012066,"name":"Elisabeth"},"members":270,"name":"The Apolitical Bipolar Meetup Group","id":1631842,"state":"NY","urlname":"The-Other-apolitical-NYC-Bipolar-Meetup-Group","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1271532198000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"metaphysics","name":"Metaphysics","id":774},{"urlkey":"reiki","name":"Reiki","id":1204},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"lawofattraction","name":"Law of Attraction","id":3382},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nyspirit\/","rating":4.94,"description":"<p>Meet other locals to discuss your path.

In some ways it is similar to card games like rummy or poker, but it is played with a set of tiles instead of a deck of cards. This game is very popular in Japan, and is rapidly gaining popularity in the United States. Envision a game with its roots in gambling, played by the Yakuza... but with a strong skill component that makes it suitable for competitive play too. Riichi Mahjong retains the excitement of a gambling-style game, but also emphasizes strategy. It is a game with a lot of depth and richness, but most of all, it's REALLY FUN!<\/p>\n<p><em>More about the USPML<\/em><br>\n\n The USPML is a new organization for Riichi mahjong players in America.

We meet three Tuesday mornings each month at 7:30 AM at the Concord Diner, 99 Fourth St. (between Sunrise Highway and Rockaway Ave.), Valley Stream. The first Tuesday of each month we meet in the evening at various locations. Our goal is simple - to refer business to our members. Our meetings are professional, casual and friendly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : justify\"><span style=\"font-size : medium\">People do business with people they know and like and with professions they understand. Unlike the once-a-month business card exchanges, our group meets every week so our members get to know one another. Each week every member gives a 60 second \"infomercial\" and one member per week gives a more in-depth 10 minute presentation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : justify\"><span style=\"font-size : medium\">We allow one person per profession. If you are the first person in your profession to join you can lock out your competition. There are no fees to join. The cost of whatever you eat or drink is yours. Our only requirements are that you attend at least two meetings a month (so we can get to know you and you can get to know others), that your profession is not already represented (see the list below) and that you are willing to try to provide referrals to group members (just as we will try to refer to you).<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : justify\"><span style=\"font-size : medium\">You can

#000000\">This community is for people who want to learn about life-force energy.\u00a0 With a blend of gentle movements and relaxed meditation, Qigong helps the body and mind.\u00a0 Although gym classes or jogging can be relaxing and help strengthen the body, people are often merely spending \u201cfuel\u201d without generating it. \u00a0The ancient arts of Qigong and Yoga are so well-balanced that you can generate Qi, or life-force energy, to have a surplus of this energy after the exercise is finished (more than you began with!)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">I\u2019m honored to be the organizer of this group.\u00a0 I thank Sal for his work bringing people together.\u00a0 We will carry on the torch and make these ancient and effective styles available to the masses. \u00a0Members feel free to email others through the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Qigong-Chinese-Arts\/members\/\">member's section<\/a> to get together and trade modalities, talk about the styles you practice, or meet for tea or coffee to get to know others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">There's also a <a

accumulated wisdom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">I\u2019ve experienced many beneficial results from practicing Qigong and the internal styles of martial arts such as Bagua Chuan

I encourage cross-discipline stuff, such as engineers working with artists (I seen this happen, its amazing). We can contribute our talents to each other.

PLAY: We will get together time to time to discuss ideas, and also set up creative play-dates in the New Jersey\/NYC area.

To help others in their personal journey of transformation, and to help them understand that it is an ability we all possess.<\/p>\n<p>The name holds great significance for me: Indigo refers to our third eye and clear seeing, Papillion is French for butterfly- a symbol of transformation. This center's purpose is to help and guide through that journey of transformation, through learning, sharing, and growing.<\/p>\n<p>We all have psychic ability whether or not we are aware of it. The classes that will be offered will allow you to explore in a way that is gentle and non-judgmental. I take great joy in helping others to discover what is already there.<\/p>\n<p>About me:<\/p>\n<p>I am a Psychic-Medium in NJ and New England. I specialize in card reading, but in many other modalities as well; such as Flower reading, Spirit guide communication, Mediumship work, Angel communication, Animal communication, object &amp; picture readings, and chord cutting.\u00a0I am a Reiki practitioner and Energetic healer, teach classes,\u00a0and more.

I come armed with numerous thorough, expensive and informative Psychiatric textbooks, a few Clinical Psychology Textbooks, as well as numerous excellent books on Bipolar Disorder, which you will have full access to once you join the group. The books alone are worth thousands of dollars. Then I also add to the mix professional, peer-reviewed papers found on PubMed or PsychINFO that address salient issues that those with Bipolar Disorder must face.<\/p>\n<p>I ask for a $40 initiation fee from each member not to cover the costs of the thousands of dollars of excellent written resources that you'd otherwise be without. Rather, I ask for a one-time $40 fee to show your support of my emails reviewing literature that are very easy to read when some of these original documents\/textbooks are not written for the general public. In my emails, I also share my personal struggles\/insights that come from having Bipolar Disorder myself. You also get stellar email responses from other members who share your passion for knowing as much as possible about what may help us get better while weeding out the junk information that is not credible.<\/p>\n<p>A little more about me. I don't mean to boast, but I feel I must if I am to ask for your money to hear from me. I was a medical student at New York Medical College in Westchester when I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder type I. After my diagnosis, I found medical school to be much more of a struggle, especially during my third year when I was suicidally depressed while having to work extremely hard on the wards, only to go home to more studying in a perpetual state of sleep deprivation. Anyone with Bipolar Disorder knows that extreme sleep deprivation and highly stressful environments can make it incredibly hard to thrive with our disease. I'm skipping over a little bit of the story here, but basically I decided to pursue a Psy.D. in Clinical Psychology instead of pursuing a residency in Psychiatry because 1. I would learn psychotherapy much better this way and 2. I would not have to subject myself to a lifestyle that is incompatible with my illness. While there's a bit more to the story, what I shared is a pretty good summary of what happened.<\/p>\n<p>I have a few test scores that I wish to share because I think it helps me justify asking for an initiation fee, while I don't like boasting. On the Psychiatry shelf exam (the test all third year medical students take to assess how well they understand\/can properly treat Psychiatric illness, I scored 2 standard deviations above the national mean. That means 98% of the nation's med students scored below me on this assessment of our mastery of Psychiatry. Then in order to apply to the field of Clinical Psychology, I took the GRE Psychology subject test and got a 790 with 98% scoring below me again. The point is I humbly consider myself on the road to becoming a true expert on Bipolar Disorder and Clinical Psychology\/Psychiatry in general. This means I can answer a lot of your questions, and I'm a very good researcher so I can almost always look up the answer when I don't know it.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, the $40 buys you the ability to ask me to provide a detailed summary of whatever topic you are interested in, so long as it pertains to Bipolar Disorder or Psychiatry more generally. Since I work for you, I ask for a one-time fee for compensation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here are the topics that I review on a regular basis:<\/p>\n<p>*The importance of sleep in Bipolar Disorder, including how we can best get ourselves sleeping well<\/p>\n<p>*A review of the things that those with Bipolar Disorder do who thrive that is different from the rest of us. This includes understanding the importance of trying to spot depression or mania as early on as possible, and then act in such a way as to prevent a pathological state from occurring. I believe everyone with Bipolar Disorder who wishes to thrive must play a very active role in self-monitoring and prevention of disease states.<\/p>\n<p>*Reevaluating the nature of hypomania and mania, and how it's different from genuine well-being. I share why I believe living without hypomania (or mania) is ideal for me. I challenge those who are drawn to reexperiencing hypomania or mania to consider the wisdom and how much more rewarding living a symptomless life can be.<\/p>\n<p>*How to thrive with Bipolar Disorder at work and school, and the importance of becoming aware of the cognitive deficits that are common to Bipolar Disorder.<\/p>\n<p>*Everything you didn't know about why lithium and other mood stabilizers are good for the Bipolar brain and how lithium is the best drug for preventing suicide in individuals with Bipolar Disorder.<\/p>\n<p>*Suicide, especially focusing on elucidating how big a problem is it and what can we do to get out of a suicidal situation.<\/p>\n<p>*Understanding how we differ from a \"normal\" person, even when we are in our \"normal\" state (aka when we're euthymic).<\/p>\n<p>*The importance of getting regular blood work to prevent organ damage that might otherwise result in extensive damage as this type of organ damage largely occurs silently.<\/p>\n<p>*Thorough review of all medication related to Bipolar Disorder, including efficacy and common side effects. In particular, I focus on antipsychotics, and how best to balance desired effect with the potential for horrible side effects.<\/p>\n<p>*Understanding Bipolar Depression, which is different from Unipolar Depression and generally harder to treat. On average someone with Bipolar Disorder will spend 3x more time in a state of depression than mania.<\/p>\n<p>*The power of Positive Psychology to help with all things Bipolar, most especially when one suffers from depression.<\/p>\n<p>*A review of the major forms of psychotherapies being used for Bipolar Disorder, including efficacy and when they're indicated.<\/p>\n<p>*A review of how Dialectic Behavioral Therapy (DBT) may be a critical component in the treatment of many individuals with Bipolar Disorder.<\/p>\n<p>*Quirky facts about Bipolar Disorder like how on average people with Bipolar Disorder are smarter than the general population, noteworthy characters in history\/the media who have Bipolar Disorder, the truth behind the mad genius stereotype, and when are we most creative.<\/p>\n<p>*A review of the neuroscience associated with Bipolar Disorder.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I could keep listing topics, but I've probably already overwhelmed the reader with my list. Any member can email me asking for a synopsis on any of these topics or any other topic that you believe is important, and I will respond with an informative and easily readable summary of the salient points. If I drop the ball and do not produce such a response within 3 weeks of your request, then I will grant you a full refund of your initiation fee.<\/p>\n<p>Note: This meetup is currently too small for regular in person meetups, but it is constantly growing so I'm confident in the not-so-distant future we will do in person meetups regularly. That was the primary aim of my meetup when I brought it into inception. In the meantime, if it's in person meetups that you're primarily after, I refer you to the numerous other excellent Bipolar Disorder support groups offered on meetup that are based in NYC. That said, we will do occasional meetups, and, again, I promise in the not-so-distant future we will start doing in person meetups frequently.<\/p>\n<p>I think I finally stopped talking.

Life as we knew it is torn apart and we need support from others. Most people are unprepared for the emotional turmoil, mental anguish and practical side of breakups or divorce. If you are separated, going through a divorce, or newly single our support group can help you feel empowered and ease the process. As a Breakups and Divorce Coach dedicated to support and empowerment during difficult times, each meetup will be facilitated and feature a theme that is specific to breakups, divorce and renewal. They may be related to emotions, healing, practical concerns, communication, relationships or dating again. We'll have a presentation, discussion, group sharing, and an exercise or techniques that will help us apply the concepts directly to our lives.

This meetup will allow you to use the language of archetypal symbols in order to understand the deeper knowledge locked in your unconscious and the unconscious of those you read.<\/p>\n<p>Meet-up 1 : Middle Eastern Tasseography and Southeast Asian Shamanism<br>\n\nUsing techniques from little known divination traditions such as Turkish Coffee and Southeast Asian Shamanism; you will learn to look into the patterns and formations of natural materials to recognize symbols that reveal the secrets of the mind.<\/p>\n<p>Visit TurkishCupReading.com and SelfEmpoweredMinds.com for more details and private sessions<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/c\/a\/1\/highres_43716001.jpeg","photo_id":43716001,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/c\/a\/1\/600_43716001.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/c\/a\/1\/thumb_43716001.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8206640,"name":"Saba"},"members":670,"name":"Awakening The Third Eye Workshop","id":1672474,"state":"NY","urlname":"Awakening-The-Third-Eye-Workshop","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Third Eye Seekers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"members","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1278615604000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"musicians","name":"Musicians","id":173},{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"jpop","name":"Japanese Pop","id":508},{"urlkey":"karaoke","name":"Karaoke","id":1193},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"80smusic","name":"80's Music","id":2272},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"music","name":"Music","id":15018},{"urlkey":"drinking","name":"Drinking","id":15546},{"urlkey":"girls-night-out","name":"Girls' Night Out","id":16550},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Karaokaholics\/","rating":4.29,"description":"<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n  <span style=\"color : #000000\">\n    <span style=\"font-size : small\">This group was started so that music lovers and singing fanatics can enjoy both, all around the city, with an amazing group of people.\n    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n    <br \/>The purpose of this group is to socialize, sing, network and have an all around great time away from the 9 to 5.\n    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n    <br \/>Come and be a part of this great community!!<\/span>\n  <\/span>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <span style=\"font-size : small\">\n    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n  <\/span>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <span style=\"font-size : small\">Also:<\/span>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <span style=\"font-size : small\">\n    <span style=\"font-size : 12px\">Meetup tends to overwhelm members with emails and it's likely you'll miss or filter most messages.

The entry price alone is around $35 to $40, and then you have the drinks and transportation... This would all be fine if you felt pretty sure you were going to meet your one-and-only that night, but often you simply need to go a few times to come across the person that's right for you.<\/p>\n<p>Don't get us wrong - we're huge fans of speed-dating. We think it way better than online dating, as you can not beat a quick face-to-face encounter to establish if the chemistry is right. We'd just like to make it a little cheaper, especially in times when we're all being conscious about what we spend our money on. And remember, the product is actually you, and the other 30 fabulous NYC singles attending - why should we pay $40 for that.<\/p>\n<p>Our aim is simple - we want to inform our members of cheap or free spots at speed-dating events, and\/or ensure that you're enjoying a free or inexpensive drink or appetizers while you there.<\/p>\n<p>This is not as hard as you might think. Unlike other singles events, speed-dating companies must almost exactly balance the number of men and women attending. It's not uncommon(for example) for a speed-dating company to be short eight women aged 28-37 the night before the event. They contact us, we shoot for free or maximum $10 spots, and everyone is happy.<\/p>\n<p>Now, here's the catch. We need you to play your part - in other words, if you rsvp to say you want to come, then you do need to show up. And at the event, as many of the participants will have paid full price, then to avoid any grumpiness, we would ask that you don't share your discounted or free rate.<\/p>\n<p>So if you're someone who is single and looking to date, is budget conscious, and can be a little flexible and spontaneous when offers come your way, then this Meetup group is for you! And there is no downside to joining - we'll simply inform you of free or cheap spots, and if you want to come, you rsvp. We will then contact you to let you know if you have a spot (i.e., you don't have a spot just by RSVPing here, you have a spot once you register with a free or discount code on the speed-dating site).<\/p>\n<p>Looking forward to helping you get dates!<\/p>\n<p>Jen<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/4\/highres_277681972.jpeg","photo_id":277681972,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/4\/600_277681972.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/4\/thumb_277681972.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":4064503,"name":"Daniel"},"members":1169,"name":"New York City Free Speeddating Group","id":1673341,"state":"NY","urlname":"nyc-free-speeddating","category":{"name":"singles","id":30,"shortname":"singles"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1278861643000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"art","name":"Live Music","id":1502},{"urlkey":"creativecircle","name":"Creative Circle","id":10447},{"urlkey":"arts","name":"Arts & Entertainment","id":10574},{"urlkey":"painting","name":"Painting","id":16784},{"urlkey":"landscape-painting","name":"Landscape Painting","id":18373},{"urlkey":"self-expression","name":"Self Expression","id":19588},{"urlkey":"acrylic-painting-classes","name":"Acrylic Painting classes","id":19850},{"urlkey":"oil-painting","name":"Oil Painting","id":22825},{"urlkey":"painting-oil-acrylic-watercolor-etc","name":"Painting - Oil, Acrylic, Watercolor, etc.","id":25223},{"urlkey":"new-york-city-events","name":"New York City Events","id":26546},{"urlkey":"watercolor-painting","name":"Watercolor Painting","id":53124}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Outdoor-Plein-Air-Painting-classes-in-New-York\/","rating":5,"description":"<p><span style=\"color : #333399\"><strong><span style=\"font-size : small\"><span style=\"color : #0000ff\">This group is for you if you would like a\u00a0great group of people to paint with as well as\u00a0an experienced,\u00a0professional painter alongside you to show you the ropes and help develop your own creativity. <em>Don't go it alone; have someone there to help bring out the best in your paintings!<\/em><\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color : #333399\"><span style=\"font-size : small\"><span style=\"color : #333399\"><span style=\"color : #ff00ff\"><span style=\"font-size : small\">So you would like to try painting and\u00a0you don't have an easel or paints?<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span> <span style=\"color : #333399\"><span style=\"font-size : small\"><span style=\"color : #333399\"><span style=\"color : #ff00ff\"><span style=\"font-size : small\">No<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span> <span style=\"color : #333399\"><span style=\"font-size : small\"><span style=\"color : #333399\"><span style=\"color : #ff00ff\"><span style=\"font-size : small\">problem, just choose the day you can attend and everything needed will be brought along for you!<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #333399\"><strong><span style=\"font-size : small\"><span style=\"color : #333399\"><span style=\"color : #ff00ff\"><span style=\"font-size : small\"><span style=\"color : #33cccc\">Never painted before?

Meditation is the route to that knowing.It is a methodology of science of awareness.<\/p>\n<p>Many meditative techniques require one to sit still and silent. But for most of us accumulated stress in our bodymind makes that difficult. Before we can hope to access our inner powerhouse of consciousness, we need to let go of our tensions.<\/p>\n<p>Osho (1931-1990) is an enlightened mystic who has given many new techniques of active meditations for the inner transformation of the modern man.\u00a0His active meditations like <strong>Dynamic meditation, Kundalini meditation<\/strong>, Nadabrahma meditation are scientifically devised to consciously express and experience repressed feelings and emotions, and learn the knack of watching our habitual patterns in a new way.You can\u00a0find out the science behind some of Osho meditations by clicking <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/oshonewyork\/about\/\"><strong><span style=\"color : #ff6600\">here<\/span><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Osho's\u00a0techniques give more freedom of expression.

Our future is based on delivering results for our members. Join us, so we can show you how we build trusted relationships. Sales pitches (or giving UN-solicited information about your business) is discouraged. Having said that, if you have a question about your sales pitch as such is encouraged. There in, lies the essence of our group, not buying or selling, yet discussing and learning how to produce,process buy and sell in order to elevate our business\/skill set.<\/p>\n<p>Lead generation, is not a good reason to join or attend. After years organizing this group, a good number of people (including myself) attending having found that the leads generated within the group are minimal. What others have shared (I've experienced) is that the connections made, have lead to opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>So, North Jersey Small Business Networking (NJ-SBN) mission is to give business owners a place to improve business methods. Some members call us a self help group of owners or a \"master mind\" group. We want to understand \"Why\" you are in the business you are in, rather than learn about your product or service. We love hearing about great business methods and&nbsp;horrible&nbsp;ones also. This helps us learn how and why to trust you, after that much more is possible, join in.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to learn about Social Networking we are the only group that views itself (or at least I do) as a social network experiment, education by doing and learning. We are learning about different tools available to increase the efficiency of networking. Being transparent and encouraging members to discuss, question and give feedback is a driving factor for NJ-SBN. Every member will learn something different, some will gain and others will give. Each week with different members the group is always changing, and brings in new opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>We have been developing this community for over 3 years, in anticipation of your membership, we'll be waiting for you on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for time, I invite you to join us.<\/p>\n<p>Respectfully,<\/p>\n<p>Steve Navazio<\/p>","lon":-74.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/4\/0\/e\/highres_99877902.jpeg","photo_id":99877902,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/4\/0\/e\/600_99877902.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/4\/0\/e\/thumb_99877902.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":12641108,"name":"Stephen Navazio"},"members":345,"name":"Small Business Advice and Assistance","id":1686732,"state":"NJ","urlname":"NJ-SBN","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.9500007629,"who":"Owners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1281309785000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"singles-30s-50s","name":"Singles 30's-50's","id":16660},{"urlkey":"black-singles","name":"Black Singles","id":17053},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"interracial-dating","name":"Interracial Dating","id":25504},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"single-parties","name":"Single Parents","id":59433}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/interracial-dating-group\/","rating":3.43,"description":"<p>The Interracial Dating Group is for single people who are interested in dating other single people outside of their race.<\/p>\n<p>As much as NYC is filled with so many different races and ethnicities, many of us tend to stay within our own circles which often makes it difficult to meet and date people outside our comfort zone. Now here's a group to bring single people of different races together to get to know each other, mix it up and possibly date or at the very least make a new friend.<\/p>\n<p>However, in order to join and remain a member of the group ALL members nust adhere to a few rules:<\/p>\n<p>Since this is a dating group ask all members MUST post a picture of themselves within their profiles. Let's fact it when it comes to dating looks do count, so please take a minute or two to post a picture of yourself within your profile and let other members see a face behind the words.<\/p>\n<p>We also ask ALL members to please take a few minutes to fill out our Member Questionnaire, this is an important way for you to introduce yourself, tell us about some of your interests and let everyone know what you're looking for, whether it's casual dating, a possible relationship or just friendship.<\/p>\n<p>Also, since YOU are the most important part of our success, we ask ALL Interracial Dating Group members to do the best they can to ATTEND our meetups.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, we all have lives to lead and jobs to make sure the lights stay on, but what's the point in joining a group if you're not going to participate? This doesn't mean that you have to attend all of our meetups (of course you can if you'd like that'd be great!), but since we now meet every couple of weeks (sometimes MORE!), we ask that you try to make it to at least a quarter of our meetups (that's one every couple of months), that seems fair. Remember there are single people out there who want to meet you so come out to one of our meetups and join the fun.<\/p>\n<p>We ask too that all members try to arrive on time to our meetups (which usually last a couple of hours at least) and if there any problems with the group or other members please feel free to contact whoever is hosting that meetup (or myself) and let them know (granted we're all adults and shouldn't need babysitters, but sometimes stuff happens).<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, there is a small $12\/annual fee to join this meetup group--in order words, only a dollar a month to take part in our monthly meetups as well as other social gatherings and meet other singles who are interested in dating outside their race, in person!<\/p>\n<p>Once you've joined the group always feel free share ideas, give us feedback, let us know how we're doing and rate our meetups, we want your feedback so we can make the group the best that it can

So, please join this group and let the Video Gaming References (pwn it!), MIT Science Degrees, Thick Rim Glasses!,&nbsp;Apple Computer Obsessions, and horribly uncoordinated outfits designed entirely for comfort and not in any way for fashion unleash themselves like Guile's Sonic Boom in Super Street Fighter II !!!<\/p>\n<p>We will be visiting arcades, playing video games, going to&nbsp;science museums, watching science fiction movies and just chillin' in NYC. The meetups will be highly geek oriented, and suggestions are always welcome. You can always count on their being quality geek peeps, food and fun!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>All meetings are BYOG, Bring Your Own Glasses :)<\/p>","lon":-73.9499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/1\/f\/e\/highres_17273758.jpeg","photo_id":17273758,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/1\/f\/e\/600_17273758.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/1\/f\/e\/thumb_17273758.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12791348,"name":"Teri Rydl"},"members":936,"name":"NYC Young LGBT Geeks and Gaymers Meetup Group","id":1691591,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Young-LGBT-Geeks-and-Gaymers-Meetup-Group","category":{"name":"sci-fi\/fantasy","id":29,"shortname":"sci-fi-fantasy"},"lat":40.8100013733,"who":"LGBT Geeks"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1281964683000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"classics","name":"Classic Books","id":506},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"literature","name":"Literature","id":15321},{"urlkey":"literary-classics","name":"Literary Classics","id":90866}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Manhattan-Great-Books-Discussion-Group\/","rating":4.86,"description":"<p><span>What is our Great Books Reading Discussion Group and how do we work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>First we use the methods and texts from the Great Books Foundation. Our method is called Shared Inquiry and all texts for 2015-2016 season are from the second series of the Great Books Reading and Discussion Program. &nbsp;(You can buy the set of paperbacks and the discussion guide from<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/store.greatbooks.org\/book-groups-colleges\/great-books\/adu-02.html\"> Great Books<\/a><span>.) &nbsp;Purchasing the texts is a prerequisite for joining the group and reading the text is a prerequisite for discussion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For a list of the readings for the upcoming year look at the calendar or download the schedule under \"More\/Files\", the menu item at the top of the page.<\/p>\n<p><span>What is Shared Inquiry and how was it developed? Shared Inquiry was developed by Robert Maynard Hutchins and Mortimer Adler at the University of Chicago in 1947 to help discussion participants explore, interpret and evaluate the sometimes complex and challenging ideas in the great works we discuss. It is an intellectually rigorous activity that focuses on the interpretation of meaning within the written texts. It is Socratic in style and firmly text based.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In this process participants enjoy the benefits of diverse points of view focused exploration and common discovery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Each Participant is engaged in an active search for the meaning of the selection at hand. With the energy and encouragement of the group, participants articulate ideas, support assertions with evidence from the text and grapple together with different possibilities of meaning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>How does it work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>There is a \u201cleader\u201d for each selection. The leader has read the text at least twice carefully and has developed interpretive questions\u2014things that puzzled the reader (not questions with specific answers).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>It is NOT a free-wheeling exchange of opinions and testimonials which go outside the text. Questions and discussions are always firmly grounded in the text itself.<\/span> <br> <span>Here are the basic guidelines:<\/span> <br> <span>1. Read the selection carefully before participating in the discussion. Take notes as you read.<\/span> <br> <span>2. Support your ideas with evidence from the text.<\/span> <br> <span>3. Discuss the ideas in the selection and try to understand them fully.<\/span> <br> <span>4. Listen carefully to other participants and respond to them directly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>What do you have to do to join?<\/span><\/p>\n<p> <br>1. To join the GreatBooks discussion, contact&nbsp; Larry Schiff&nbsp; 917 749 0695, <a href=\"mailto:larry@larryschiff.com\">larry@larryschiff.com<\/a> or Tamara Bedi\u0107&nbsp; <a href=\"mailto:tamara_bedic@yahoo.com\">tamara_bedic@yahoo.com<\/a> . <br>2. After clarifying with Larry or Tamara that you would like to discuss the readings based only on what is in the text of the reading, buy the texts from the Great Books Foundation ($28.95 plus shipping and tax) at&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/store.greatbooks.org\/book-groups-colleges\/great-books\/adu-02.html\">Great Books<\/a>. <br>3. Read the selection carefully as described above. <br>4. Come in and share (the first Wednesday of each month from 7:00-9:00 PM at the location that Larry or Tamara will send you in an email.) We charge a $5 fee for each meeting to pay for the cost of the room, if you are not a member of the Ethical Culture Society.<\/p>\n<p><span>Check the calendar for exact readings and dates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Many of our current members have been in our group for years.

Please use our Meetup resources as a form of Boot Camp preparation ;-)<\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span style=\"color : #000000 ; font-size : small\">Stay tuned for updates!<\/span><span style=\"color : #008a17\"><br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/greencitychallenge.org\/\">Green City Challenge<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Click the links below to learn more:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Green-City-Challenge\/pages\/LIVE_GREEN.\">LIVE GREEN.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Green-City-Challenge\/pages\/WORK_GREEN.\">WORK GREEN.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Green-City-Challenge\/pages\/EAT_GREEN.\">EAT GREEN.<\/a><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/d\/1\/7\/highres_17436119.jpeg","photo_id":17436119,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/d\/1\/7\/600_17436119.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/d\/1\/7\/thumb_17436119.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11651546,"name":"Mark Anthony"},"members":169,"name":"Green City Challenge","id":1695778,"state":"NY","urlname":"Green-City-Challenge","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Iselin","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1282750284000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"user-group","name":"User Group","id":17638},{"urlkey":"bootstrap","name":"Bootstrap","id":19373},{"urlkey":"functional-programming","name":"Functional Programming","id":22792},{"urlkey":"data-analytics","name":"Data Analytics","id":30928},{"urlkey":"r-users-group","name":"R Users Group","id":38457},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"web-based-r-reporting","name":"Web Based R Reporting","id":77962},{"urlkey":"r-project-for-statistical-computing","name":"R Project for Statistical Computing","id":98380}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NewJerseyR\/","rating":4.83,"description":"<p><span style=\"font-size : large\">NewJerseyR<\/span><\/p>\n<p>NewJerseyR will be a free informal event, held quarterly and intended to serve as a platform for all local (and regional) R users to present and exchange their experiences and ideas around the usage of R.<\/p>\n<p>A typical meeting will consist of 3-4 talks of about 20-25 min to give plenty of room for sharing your R experiences, discussions and exchange of ideas.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : large\">What is R?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/\">GNU project<\/a> which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&amp;T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.<\/p>\n<p>R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.<\/p>\n<p>One of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.<\/p>\n<p>R is available as Free Software under the terms of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/\">Free Software Foundation<\/a>'s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.r-project.org\/COPYING\">GNU General Public License<\/a> in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.<\/p>\n<p>This information and more can be found at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.r-project.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.r-project.org\/<\/a> \u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : large\"><br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>","lon":-74.3099975586,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/6\/6\/highres_17461382.jpeg","photo_id":17461382,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/6\/6\/600_17461382.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/6\/6\/thumb_17461382.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11378888,"name":"Liz Matthews"},"members":209,"name":"NewJerseyR","id":1696490,"state":"NJ","urlname":"NewJerseyR","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.5699996948,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1282797714000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"robotics","name":"Robotics","id":682},{"urlkey":"aibo","name":"Aibo","id":2099},{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"i-cybie","name":"i-Cybie","id":121665},{"urlkey":"roomba","name":"Roomba","id":121666},{"urlkey":"genibo","name":"Genibo","id":121667},{"urlkey":"aldebaran","name":"Aldebaran","id":121668},{"urlkey":"anthropomorphism","name":"Anthropomorphism","id":121669},{"urlkey":"robot-art-sculpture","name":"Robot Art & Sculpture","id":121670}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/R080TS\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is an interest group about robots.

As a group we have been playing regularly for the past few years. But as time goes by we've lost more members than have joined due to family, jobs, life, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Our member's love of the game and sportsmanship remain. We play a competitive but relaxed game. We welcome new members and integrate them into football extremely well due to our relaxed nature. We teach and encourage members and treat them with respect. That means not degrading ppl for dropping passes, failing to run routes, etc. Everyone's a newbie at some time and we appreciate that ppl are willing to come out and spend their time with us. This is, after all, a game for FUN!<\/p>\n<p>A new member noted to me \"Wow it's great that it's competitive yet fun. I was in other groups whereby people would scream and yell at one another which made the games less than fun.\" We have guidelines established that resolves conflicts, disagreements quickly. We will kick off any person who is belligerent or degrades others. Fortunately we haven't had to come across this thus far.<\/p>\n<p>As I noted we do play regularly. Ever since we joined meetup we've had many new members. We play pretty much every Sunday at 9AM and we usually have enough people for a full game. We try to get two separate games going at once when we can get 20 people. At our current pace that shouldn't be a problem at all.<\/p>\n<p>We play two hand touch football. We normally play 6 on 6, just QB and receivers. We don't do linemen, kickoffs, flag football, running plays as to reduce injury risks. We've played these previously and tailored our current game to increase the fun and decrease the risks. Games are played until someone scores up to 7 points. If we have two separate games going the winner of each game plays the other to add in a little variety.<\/p>\n<p>For those that don't have a car then please contact our leadership team. We can likely pick you up from a nearby train station. After the first game we can try to get another member to share a ride.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, if you're looking for a fun game with competitive but relaxed people then come to our game. You'll have so much exercise your muscles will hurt the first week but you'll be wanting more afterwards!<\/p>","lon":-74.0199966431,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/0\/b\/highres_17797387.jpeg","photo_id":17797387,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/0\/b\/600_17797387.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/0\/b\/thumb_17797387.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12764116,"name":"Michael"},"members":760,"name":"NYC\/Brooklyn Touch\/Flag Football","id":1697168,"state":"NY","urlname":"BrooklynFootball","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Players"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1282926301000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"filmind","name":"Film Industry","id":382},{"urlkey":"tvproduction","name":"Television Production","id":1855},{"urlkey":"entertain","name":"Entertainment Industry","id":10269},{"urlkey":"post-production","name":"Post Production","id":15972},{"urlkey":"video-editing","name":"Video Editing","id":18148},{"urlkey":"visual-effects","name":"Visual Effects","id":30987},{"urlkey":"visual-effects-cg-animation","name":"Visual Effects CG Animation","id":70655},{"urlkey":"audio-for-post-production","name":"Audio for Post Production","id":75329}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nyc-pp\/","rating":4.32,"description":"<p>This is a very casual meetup for people involved in video\/audio post production of any kind.

We plan on doing shoots at a big studio in Manhatten on Broadway as well as Luxury Yachts, Limo rides through the streets of NYC and weather permiting Beach shoots at sunset. Any photographers who want to push the envelope as they say to get that perfect shot should consider our group. Models are also welcome if the ideas that I have expressed excite your imagination as to the possible photos you would recieve as a result of our workshops. All models will be paid a set fee for the workshops and if possible we will have One on One's where the models can shoot with a photographer 1 on 1 for additional fees.

Please, don't take a&nbsp;spot and not show up as your team relies on your attendance!!<\/span> If you do this after receiving a warning, you are barred from RSVPing for a month and lose a spot in&nbsp;the next tournament.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In case of bad weather, check the site before you head out, in case of cancellation because of heavy rain or snow.&nbsp; We try to call the games about 1 hour before the posted start time.<\/p>\n<p> <br> <strong>THE LATEST&nbsp;FAll 2014 INFORMATION:<\/strong> <br> At the present time,&nbsp;there are THREE &nbsp;options each week:<\/p>\n<p>(1). Friday Night Turf - 10:30 pm, (Hofstra Bubble - Hempstead - Hosted by Dennis).<\/p>\n<p>(2) Saturday morning at 10:00 am (Sewanhaka HS -Floral Park) (Hosted by Dawn).<\/p>\n<p>(3) Sunday morning at 10:00 am (Sewanhaka HS) (Hosted by Tara).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Rules of Play:<\/p>\n<p>Please note that all of our events are friendly events where slide talking, aggressive play and abusive language are not tolerated.&nbsp; Any member who engages in this&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;misconduct&nbsp;will have their membership&nbsp;revoked.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please also understand that soccer is a contact sport and that while we do our best to make it a fun game, you are assuming the risk of sustaining a serious injury when you play in one of our games.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Offsides Rule:<\/p>\n<p>Since we don't have referees, we enforce offsides on an honor system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Players are expected to always play fairly and this includes playing onside at all times.&nbsp; If, however, you notice that someone is offside, you may call that player offside.&nbsp; To enforce this rule, we ask defenders and keepers to be mindful of the rule and to politely enforce the rule at all times. If there is someone posing a particular problem, please notify your organizer and they will resolve if offline at a later time.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\"Hot Lava\" Rule:<\/p>\n<p>When we use the small Pugg goals, you'll notice that we sometimes place orange disc cones in front of the goal to form a bigger perimeter.&nbsp; No player (including the keeper) is permitted to stand idle inside the box or the \"hot lava\", unless and until there is play in front of the goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the hot lava perimeter is to open up the goal and afford more chances for a shot or goal.&nbsp; The Puggs are small and shots are difficult to begin with.&nbsp; It's been our experience that having defenders and keepers standing idle in front of the goal greatly reduces opportunities for goals.&nbsp; If you notice players standing inside the hot lava you may politely remind them of the hot lava rule.&nbsp; If there is someone posing a particular problem, please notify you organizer and they will resolve it via the meetup site at a later time.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Penalty Kicks: are always indirect kicks.<\/p>","lon":-73.7099990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/b\/f\/2\/highres_431864018.jpeg","photo_id":431864018,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/b\/f\/2\/600_431864018.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/b\/f\/2\/thumb_431864018.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":3706781,"name":"Tara"},"members":963,"name":"Long Island Co-Ed Soccer Club","id":1699696,"state":"NY","urlname":"LongIslandCoEdSoccer","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Soccer Players"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Summit","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1283384335000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"rockclimbing","name":"Rock Climbing","id":1566},{"urlkey":"indoor-rock-climbing","name":"Indoor Rock Climbing","id":21052},{"urlkey":"scuba-diving-snorkeling-all-ocean-activites","name":"Scuba Diving - Snorkeling All Ocean Activites","id":24592},{"urlkey":"scuba-diving-travel","name":"Scuba Diving Travel","id":30900}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/No-DramaOutdoors\/","rating":4.92,"description":"<p>\u201cThe great outdoors is the path to a great life, by taking in nature, nature takes us and gives us the inner peace, our body and mind crave.\u201d<br>\n\n GEV<br>\n\n Welcome to NO DRAMA OUTDOORS, we are an eclectic group of outdoor enthusiasts, with the sole purpose of:<\/p>\n<p>*Bringing like-minded, easy going and well mannered people together.<\/p>\n<p>*NO Tolerance for Emotional Drama, Harassment or Discrimination of any kind.<\/p>\n<p>*Trips durations are day, weekend and week long.<\/p>\n<p>*This is a predominant Rock Climbing, Scuba Diving, and Camping group.<\/p>\n<p>*Active participation is required<\/p>\n<p>The No Drama Outdoors is a SEMI-CLOSED and PRIVATE group aimed at intermediate to advanced climbers and divers.

Meetup is a venue for writers to work in the company of other writers on a regular basis. Writing, whether approached as a profession or as an avocation, is an isolating activity.

If you RSVP that you are coming, then please arrive 10-15 minutes before the start of the Meetup. The facilitator will lead introductions and then the group will write for an hour. There will then be 15-30 minutes of social time to get to know each other and possibly discuss personal writing successes such as getting published or overcoming writing resistance in some small way. No critiquing, exercises, lectures, ego, competition or feeling guilty.<\/p>\n<p>Writing is the only thing that, when I do it, I don't feel I should be doing something else. <br>Gloria Steinem<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/0\/a\/e\/highres_440329326.jpeg","photo_id":440329326,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/0\/a\/e\/600_440329326.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/0\/a\/e\/thumb_440329326.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":190139677,"name":"Shut Up & Write!"},"members":3757,"name":"Shut Up & Write!

Most of my friends and family, whom I love,&nbsp;are the opposite. And most&nbsp;do not understand my choice to forego&nbsp;children. Some think I'm selfish. Others take it personally that I have chosen something that is the opposite of what they've chosen. Meanwhile, I enjoy spending time with their children, but I'm always thrilled to go home and enjoy my childfree life. The problem is that most activities that are fun for me are not fun for people with kids. Either they don't want to leave their kids home just to grab a drink after work, or they can't, because they have to go pick them up from daycare, soccer practice, etc.<\/p>\n<p>I do <span><strong>not<\/strong><\/span> divide the world into people with children &amp; people without children.

Although I am the Senior pastor at a wonderful church on the West side of Manhattan in the West Village, I really enjoy sitting together in s a small group.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps sitting in a <em>pew<\/em> is not the enemy, however, I have found that sitting together in small groups and sharing with each other various topics, can lead us to a better understanding of ourselves, our situation in life, and more important, the God who loves each and every one of us.<\/p>\n<p>I have also found, that most people who have attended church for years or who call themselves \"Christians\" really do not understand the teachings of Jesus Christ very well, and have let others \"tell them\" what religion is all about, when in fact, religion just might be the problem. Remember, Christ had little to do with religion when he walked the earth, in fact, he found himself rejected by the faith community of his time and spent most of his teaching, with individuals and small groups. This is the concept of REACH-NYC, and I know you will enjoy these small groups.<\/p>\n<p><strong>REACH-NYC sponsores The Chapel At Union Square.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We call our gatherings <strong>\"Conversations\"<\/strong> and it is our hope that you will join us for a stimulating conversation on the Biblical issues of the day, and how growth in the teachings of Jesus Christ, can be a refreshing change for our lives.<\/p>\n<p>With this in mind, I am inviting you to explore with me your life story, what God has in store for each one of us and to join us in a safe place to relax, be yourself, say what's on your mind and find a meaningful relationship with God and good, caring friends.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We currently meet at a small intimate venue we rent at The Seafarers International House, 123 East 15th Street, NYC, on the corner of Irving Place, in the Union Square Area of New York City.\u00a0We meet promptly at 10:00 a.m. - 11:30 p.m. on Saturday mornings.<\/strong> Most people travel by bus or train to get here. There is limited street parking, however, if you do come by car, you can find reduced rate parking on East 18th Street between Third Ave. and Irving Place, on the South Side of the street, as you head East on E. 18th Street.<\/p>\n<p>You will see a sign in the window: <strong>The Chapel At Union Square<\/strong>, and depending on the size of our small group, you will find us either on the Mezzanine level in a small conference room. Just take the elevator and press <strong>\"M\"<\/strong> and make a right, where you will find us in the conference room.<\/p>\n<p>If our group grows, you will find us in the intimate chapel. As you enter the lobby of the Seafarers International House, just make a right as you enter the lobby and the chapel will be right there.<\/p>\n<p>We will post signs so you will know how to find us.<\/p>\n<p>I truly look forward to meeting you as we share the love of Jesus with each other and learn about a lifestyle that is all about the greatest teaching's Christ gave to his disciples and can be found in the Word and some great advice from the Apostle Paul, a Jewish believer and Roman citizen who became a follower of Jesus and an advocate for his teachings, that many have yet to fully comprehend.<\/p>\n<p>\"A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another\" - John 13:33-35<\/p>\n<p>\"Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice! Strive for full restoration, encourage one another, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.\" - 2 Corinthians 13:11<\/p>\n<p>May God richly bless you as you prepare to join us for a time of refreshing and peace. Christ has fully paid the price for our lives to be restored.

At most of these meetups, speakers of all levels are welcome. This means that quite a large percentage of the conversation tends to be in English.<\/p>\n<p>To learn and improve, it's necessary to immerse oneself and not to feel as if you can just switch to English anytime you want. I have started this meetup to create a place where intermediate, advanced, or native speakers can go and speak entirely in Chinese. Sure, you can translate a word or explain something complicated in English if necessary, but other than that, we're keeping it entirely in Mandarin.<\/p>\n<p>You should join this group and come to this meetup if you can have a basic conversation in Mandarin, if you have lived or traveled in a Chinese-speaking country for some length of time, if you have studied Chinese in school or on your own for a while, or if you are a native speaker. Basically, you should be able to speak Chinese to some extent already if you show up here. The whole goal is to keep the role of English as absolutely minimal as possible when we meet.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, if you are intermediate, don't be intimidated. I myself am hardly fluent, but if you have the basics down and want to improve your vocabulary and natural speaking, the best way to do it is to force yourself to use what you know and expose yourself to things you don't!<\/p>\n<p>If you're not sure whether it is right for you, just ask.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/e\/a\/highres_167459882.jpeg","photo_id":167459882,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/e\/a\/600_167459882.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/e\/a\/thumb_167459882.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":619515,"name":"Dan"},"members":1089,"name":"Advanced Chinese Conversation","id":1719006,"state":"NY","urlname":"AdvancedChineseConversation","category":{"name":"language\/ethnic identity","id":16,"shortname":"language"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1286575629000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation-for-beginners","name":"Meditation for Beginners","id":52179},{"urlkey":"meditation-in-brooklyn","name":"Meditation in Brooklyn","id":94033},{"urlkey":"meditate-in-brooklyn","name":"Meditate in Brooklyn","id":130537},{"urlkey":"meditation-in-new-york","name":"Meditation in New York","id":130538},{"urlkey":"meditate-in-new-york","name":"Meditate in New York","id":130539},{"urlkey":"meditation-in-nyc","name":"Meditation in NYC","id":130540},{"urlkey":"meditate-in-new-york-city","name":"Meditate in New York City","id":130541},{"urlkey":"meditation-in-new-york-city","name":"Meditation in New York City","id":130542},{"urlkey":"meditation-in-williamsburg-brooklyn","name":"Meditation in Williamsburg Brooklyn","id":130543},{"urlkey":"meditation-classes-in-queens-ft-greene-greenpoint","name":"Meditation Classes in Queens Ft Greene Greenpoint","id":130544},{"urlkey":"meditation-classes-in-new-york-city","name":"Meditation Classes in New York City","id":130545},{"urlkey":"meditation-classes-in-nyc","name":"Meditation Classes in NYC","id":130546},{"urlkey":"meditation-classes-in-brooklyn","name":"Meditation Classes in Brooklyn","id":130547},{"urlkey":"meditation-classes-in-williamsburg-brooklyn","name":"Meditation Classes in Williamsburg Brooklyn","id":130548}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Meditationinwilliamsburg\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Buddhist meditation has a timeless and universal relevance, and can be practiced by anyone in any culture, regardless of race, gender, or age.<\/p> \n<p>These classes are for anyone who is interested in training in meditation and other Buddhist practices to improve the quality of thier life by developing inner peace, compassion, and wisdom.<\/p> \n<p>Everyone Welcome!<\/p> \n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>Please visit our website for class cancellations and class times<\/p> \n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/mcb-williamsburg.php\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/mcb-williamsburg.php\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/mcb-williamsburg.php\">http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/mcb-williamsburg.php<\/a><\/p>","lon":-73.9499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/d\/e\/7\/highres_433596327.jpeg","photo_id":433596327,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/d\/e\/7\/600_433596327.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/d\/e\/7\/thumb_433596327.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13151575,"name":"Joseph Giacona"},"members":383,"name":"Meditation in Brooklyn","id":1719150,"state":"NY","urlname":"Meditationinwilliamsburg","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Meditators"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1286625067000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"couples","name":"Couples","id":3250},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"cocktails","name":"Cocktails","id":10475},{"urlkey":"arts","name":"Arts & Entertainment","id":10574},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"entertainment","name":"Entertainment","id":15761},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"married-couples","name":"Married Couples","id":22353}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/cherish\/","rating":4.86,"description":"<p>Hi! and welcome to Cherish.
